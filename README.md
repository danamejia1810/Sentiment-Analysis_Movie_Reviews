## üìä Analysis

### Data Acquisition

Data is obtained from the [IMDB - Avengers Reviews](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4154796/reviews?ref_=tt_ql_2) page.

Techniques are applied to clean the data for analysis:
- **Lowercasing**: Convert all text to lowercase to ensure uniformity.
- **HTML Unescaping**: Remove HTML entities.
- **Punctuation Removal**: Remove punctuation to simplify the text.
- **Removing NAs**: Handle missing values.

### üìù Natural Language Processing (NLP)

Explore the NLP techniques used:
- **Text Cleaning**: Lowercasing, HTML unescaping, punctuation removal, and removing stopwords.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Using the Vader Sentiment library and TextBlob.
- **Emotion Classification**: Using NRCLex to classify emotions in reviews.

### üì¢ Model Evaluation

We evaluated the sentiment analysis models by comparing the predicted sentiments with the actual ratings given in the reviews. The evaluation metrics included accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## üìà Results and Visualization

### Sentiment Distribution

- Positive, negative, and neutral sentiments are visualized using bar charts and word clouds for better understanding.

### Emotion Analysis

- The distribution of emotions (such as fear, anger, anticipation, etc.) is visualized using bar charts.

### Top Words

- Top 10 words for each sentiment category and each emotion category are identified and visualized.

### Word Clouds
