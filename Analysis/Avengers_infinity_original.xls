EMOTIONAL ROLLER COASTER,16 February 2021,"Avengers infinity war is an emotional roller coaster. Using the strength of its powerful and interesting villain, the movie successfully brings together the past 10 years of Marvel movies into a largely effective cocktail of super-heroic dramatics. Joe and Anthony Russo create a superhero movie that it's every bit the epic that it needs to be. However prepared you feel, you are not ready for Thanos. Infinity war is stunning, hilarious and heartbreaking.

Rating: 9.6.",9
A superior avengers sequel,5 February 2021,"Although this film has 'Avengers' in the title, it ultimately belongs to Thanos. It's his story that drives the whole plot. He is the main characters of this movie, not any of the heroes. Thanos in my opinion is the greatest villain the MCU has ever produced. as a character he is truly threatening. In most of these movies deep down I know the hero will always win. For the first time I wasn't sure if the hero would win or not. Through the movie's entirety I was on the edge of my seat wandering whether my favourite characters would actually make it out of the movie alive. To have a villain with that level of genuine threat I thought was fantastic. I also felt slightly conflicted by his motivations. On the face of it, planning to eliminate half the universe's population is obviously a bad thing; however, after we learn his motivations for wanting to do so, I'd be lying if I didn't say I understood where he was coming from. There are two tones at play in this movie. One of them is a comical tone, mostly coming from the Guardians, Thor and Spider-Man. Predominantly though this movie is dark. Because of the level of threat created by Thanos, there is an emotional aspect to this film that will take the viewer by surprise. There are plenty of large scale action sequences, which are amazing; but there are also some shocking moments that were difficult to deal with. What I can say is that, the running time of two and a half hours absolutely flew by.

Overall, Avengers: Infinity War did well in balancing the screen time among the characters in a way that every member of the Avengers get at least a moment to shine. There are also lots of great action, comedy, performances and a massive cliffhanger at the end that is well earned.",8
It all led to this: superhero film at its best,25 October 2021,"#MCUrewatch. A confrontation that has been in the making for dozen of films. Thanos finally arrives. And boy he doesn't disappoint. He is by far the most interesting MCU villain: strong, nuanced and perfectly performed by Brolin. This really is HIS movie. The film has a train like speed and one impressive sequence is followed by the next. Especially the banter between Thor and the Guardians and Iron Man vs Strange is what makes these Marvel films so fun to watch. Great climatic ending (a well ending...). As a stand-alone film it might not be as good as some others but as a showcase of what MCU has achieved, it has never been better.",8
A film that pulled off the impossible.,20 January 2021,"Avengers: Infinity War is a film that should be utter crap. A franchise stretching almost twenty films is unheard of. And making a great and satisfying climax to that franchise is nearly impossible. Considering how many characters Marvel had to juggle together with this movie, there was almost no way this movie wouldn't suck.

But it didn't. Marvel pulled it off. All of the characters were balanced seemingly effortlessly. The action was amazing. The characters were funny. The story was compelling. Marvel made what should've been an overcrowded mess into one of the best superhero films ever made.

This movie will sit you on the edge of your seat for 2 and a half hours. Hats off to the writers, directors, producers, and Marvel Studios.

"Best movie of the MCU, incredible from start to finish.",24 January 2021,,10
To this day one of the most impossible films to pull off,8 February 2021,"This film is an achievement unto itself. Unlike any other marvel movie, this deserves to be praised for bringing around 25+ popular characters and putting them all in a cohesive narrative thats unlike anything that came before it.

At least 20 movies filled with characters and storyline nuances were successfully kept intact here yet the main character was the villain that had barely had any screentime previously, yet was written in a way that you could empathise with him and tied him into prior events like the new york invasion.

The movie itself is structured perfectly, from the perspective of Thanos putting him in a heroes journey making him go to different locations to collect the stones from different heroes weve come to know, and pairing different combinations of heroes in an insanely well written way so every character stood out and had an iconic moment to shine.

All in all the scope of this film is beyond anything that has come before it and even more so than Endgame, but they kept the narrative grounded and paced it perfectly. And the ending of the movie is one of the best endings ever. The best superhero/ comic book film of all time after The Dark Knight.",10
Better than Endgame,14 March 2021,"Infinity war is one of the best MCU protects. It has a great story, great acting, and awesome looking. If you aren't a Marvel fan or haven't watched most of the previous MCU movies this however, won't be something for you. Let's start with Thanos, definitely one of the best villains, he has a motive, is well played, you can even say that Infinity war tells his story and not the story of a hero. But also most of the other cast members were great in their role and again, if you love Marvel, watch this movie.",10
Great,23 February 2020,"This movie portrays a villain that by far has been the best out of all the other Marvel antagonists. It shows his personal conflicts, his purpose, as well as his cruelty. The heroes of this film are overshadowed by this, but the ending really makes a mark on the audience.",
Best Cliffhanger of all Time,5 February 2021,"A meticulously planned film down to the last detail, where you can see how much love is behind it. Of course, the film delivers impressive show values and action, but besides, it is above all the interactions of the characters that are well thought out. Surprisingly, no character is neglected, and all the storylines of the previous films are brought together amazingly logical. The end is for me one of the best cliffhangers of all time, after the movie I was whacked. In the end, I have to ask myself: What more do I expect from a comic book superhero film? I was perfectly happy, so I can also give a comic book adaptation 10 out of 10 stars.",10
EPIC,27 July 2021,Infinity war seemed much better than endgame to be honest.,10

Way better than endgame,2 September 2019,,10
Marvel needs to keep their characters true and watch sloppy writing.,13 May 2018,,7
Before you spend your hard-earned cash...,8 May 2018,"We occasionally use IMDB to judge whether a film is worth watching at our local Odeon. Generally, that works well but a score of 8.9 for this film (currently) is hugely misleading IMHO.

This is clearly a film that polarizes audiences - those who have bought into the Marvel franchise and have watched every previous film (31 apparently) mostly love it; those (like us) who have watched a few here and there seem to be disappointed / puzzled / bored.

For a non-fan there are a couple of major issues: Too many characters and too much back story that we can't remember or never knew. The fights seemed rather perfunctory and, I know it's the fashion these days, but the shortness of each shot (a second? half a second between cuts?) makes them impossible to follow.

One positive reviewer has criticised low scorers saying it's like watching the last 2 minutes of an hour-long drama and expecting to understand it. I think that's unfair. Surely a film should make sense in and of itself - I wasn't charged less to watch this one, so surely I should be able to enjoy it on some level? For the record, we recently went to see Thor: Ragnarok and Black Panther and enjoyed them both (particularly the last one).

Which I guess brings us back to where we started... redressing the balance of that crazy 8.9 score. No, this film is NOT better than Apocalypse Now (8.5) or The Terminator (8.0) or Citizen Kane (8.4) or Taxi Driver (8.3) or Raging Bull (8.2)... that's just crazy! My honest advice: If you like Marvel, you'll probably love this; if you're not a big fan, save your money for something else.",3
Somehow they pulled this off,26 April 2018,"I consider myself a big comic book marvel fan. My favorite films from the franchise so far, are Cap. American: Winter Soldier and Thor: Ragnarok. As this movie was directed by the same guys as Winter Soldier and Civil War, I went into this movie with sky-high expectations.

I am gonna keep this brief: Avengers: Infinity War blew me away! If I should mention just one thing that really amazed me was the character of Thanos. He is so well developed and makes for a super interesting and complex villain. As an audience, we are actually capable of sympathizing with a guy, who wants to kill off half of the universe. It's not about power or dominance. It's about preserving life in a Universe with finite resources - a goal with leads him (and the avengers) into several interesting moral dilemmas.

I agree with the other reviews here. This movie is such a beautiful calamity of 10 years of the best superhero entertainment there is. Thinking about it, I can't really grasp how the director pulled this off. So many well developed characters from different story lines are working together in a true cinematic symphony.

I give this movie my highest recommendations. It's a must-see for anyone with just a remote interest in the franchise.",10
The best,7 January 2021,This is is the best marvel/avengers movie every minute is very great no cap.,10
How MCU should have always been like,21 April 2021,,10
Best movie ihave ever seen,13 July 2021,Infinity war Is the best movie . I like this movie more than avengers endgame.,10
Unlike anything ever done in the history of cinema,14 August 2018,"This movie is the beginning of the culmination of Marvel's masterfully woven cinematic universe. Beginning back in 2008 with iron man, we are finally seeing the results of all the movies have been pointing to; and it did not disappoint. Thanos is a complex villain, with deeper and more interesting desires than just ""world domination."" The dilemmas all the characters face in this movie (both the heroes and the villains) are truly thought provoking and leave you on the edge of your seat. No other set of movies has beeen so involved, so expanded, and encompassed so many story lines/characters and previous movies. The sheer amount of star power alone in this film is insane; and they do a masterful job of weaving all these unique and various characters into a common storyline.",10
avengers infinity war,29 November 2020,,10
Nothing special,8 May 2018,"Compared to the original story that started with Infinity Gauntlet, this one was very swallow, specially due to the absence of Adam Warlock. Too many jokes, poor story and too many characters simply thrown in the story and used in a very bad way made this a mediocre movie at best.",6
Better than End Game,24 January 2021,In my opinion Infinity War was much better than End Game.,9
"Thanos and Bubbles, Kiddie Mickey Mouse Style",12 May 2018,"I don't recognize the THANOS The MAD TITAN from the comic books. Thanos would NOT waste his time balancing the universe if he didn't get something out of it which was Lady Death's love. Lady Death's influence with romance makes more sense. Disney's Mickey Mouse version of Thanos was easy on the Avengers. The MAD TITAN in comics books would have not been sooo fun loving and bubbly, hilarious. Thanos motive in Disney's Mickey Mouse Avengers Infinity War movie is stupid and illogical. Mickey Mouse has turned Thanos into an EMO CRYBABY. Booo!!! Kiddie Disney ruined Avengers Infinity War which is really the Gauntlet story. DIsney can't get the titles right either. Booo!

Mickey Mouse has taking over the Marvel Universe making all comic books for the kiddies kids and less for adults. Booo! Booo! 1/10 stars",
Typical film of modern times,8 May 2018,"Film was entertaining, ive watched all marvel movies multiple times. This film is great fun but is far to rushed, of cause with so many characters involved was always going to be a tough one to do, part 2 may improve it.

Happy i saw in Imax but would def wait till on tv to watch again. overall an entertaining but average film with lots missed, nothing special and worse than some of the stand alone movies.",6
I have been fooled.,18 May 2018,"I've seen bad movies before, but I have not felt fooled while leaving the theater before.

I did have doubts whether it would still be possible to make an interesting Marvel movie since the theme has been ""rather"" popular. But some of the Marvel flicks were actually really great. So I was ready to believe the reviews, maybe this one would be good as well.

Oh boy was I fooled: Non-existing plot and acting, endless, massive, boring battles with lame weapons and superpowers, each more ridiculous than the previous. Absolutely terrible. I have never felt this angry after watching a movie. This was the last time I trust IMDB for anything.",3
"This movie will blow your mind and break your heart - and make you desperate to go back for more. Brave, brilliant and better than it has any right to be.",25 April 2018,,10
Much better than END GAME,19 June 2021,"AVENGERS:INFINITY WAR,to say in one line,is perfectly balanced as all things should be. It was the most anticipated movie of the decade,and it had to deliver what seemed impossible-bringing together two dozen superheroes,combining plot threads from the previous 18 films,introducing the biggest villain onscreen and perfectly balancing humor with emotions and action with drama-all in a single film-and the russos nailed it.... Mild Spoilers follows... The main attraction of the film ,is no doubt the Mad Titan. Thanos is not your usual villain. He is complex and multi-dimensional. He is cruel,ruthless,kills but at the same time, he mourns,shows compassion,and above all-he has a reason for his actions-and that's what makes him the most interesting and dangerous villain. He gets the most screen time than any other hero...It is as if he is the central character. Its as if we are following his journey of collecting the six infinity stones so that he can destroy half the universe. He wants to wipe out half of the universe,not because he sees fun in it nor he wants to rule. All he wants is to achieve balance in the universe. According to him if the universe is left unchecked,then the universe might destroy itself due to overpopulation. He wants to do this action so that the other half and the future generations can thrive....he describes it as mercy. Along with him ,the film also gave us sidekick antagonists in the form of black order. Among them,Ebony maw was cool to watch. The actions and choreography were amazing. If you thought the actions in the trailers were awesome,o boy...u aint seen nothing. The people behind the camera ..they did a fantastic job. The art work was good ...and the cgi and vfx looked realistic. They did a remarkable job in capturing all the facial expressions in josh brolins face. Nothing to say about screenplay...its just ....I cant imagine how they delivered it ..and like a star wars movie we got to see different parts of the galaxy-From the sanctum sanctorum to New avengers facility. From wakanda to New york. From Nevidilir to knowhere and from vormir to titan and finally to wakanda...The shifting of story from one scene to another scene and location without confusing the plot was executed perfectly. The dialogues were sensible..and the film is filled with lots of pretty and punchy one liners that will fill you with laughter,and some that will make you emotional. The character interactions...well this was what we wanted to see more than anything...and trust me ,the russo brothers delivered more than what we expected. Not only that, the film gives adequate time for characters to grow and develop in such a short time frame that you feel for each and every character ...its a treat for those who have followed all mcu films and had made the characters part of their life.....the interaction between these different characters is what makes this film unique.....there are reunions...there are first meetings..the plot is written as such that each and every character is vital to the story... The guardians get a lot of screen time...and Thor-guardians interactions are one of the best and most entertaining moments in the film .The trio formed by dr strange,peter parker and tony stark was also very amazing..The first meeting between earths mightiest heroes and the guardians of the galaxy is very funny ...The thanos-gamora relationship is very well explored ..the film also gives ample time to vision-scarlett witch romance that was teased in the trailers... captain america has a grand entry ..we get to see black panther...bruce banner ..o well he has his own arc in the film and is funny.. and so on... Its the darkest and most emotional movie in the franchise..as the first scene itself sets the tone for the entire film. The stakes are higher than ever and the ENDING will just make you numb ....., Its not just a superhero movie..Its a movie about love,relationship,sacrifice and above all asks a moral question- ""under what condition is it just to trade one innocent life to save others"".",10
Excellent Film,19 June 2018,"I was amazed to see so many negative reviews; so many people are impossible to please. This movie was 2 1/2 hours long, but I could have sat there another 2 1/2 hours and not noticed. Thoroughly entertaining, and I love how the directors weren't afraid to take chances. I've read a lot of other user reviews that claim that there's no plot. Unless you're mentally handicapped or not paying attention because you're on your phone the entire movie, the plot is pretty clear, and decent in my opinion.",9
Avengers Infinity War: Marvels crown jewel,4 May 2018,"Let me be clear Infinity War is not flawless, it has its faults but thankfully they are overshadowed by two hours of awesomeness.

Every movie in the Marvel universe for the last decade has ultimately been building up to this therefore expectations were through the roof and for the most part it delivers.

Almost every character from the MCU teams up to face its most dangerous foe yet, the mad titan himself Thanos and if you know anything about the comics then going in you'd know to brace yourself for heartache.

With all the hype as to who wouldn't survive the film I'm left wondering just how many deaths are permanent, this is a superhero universe after all so never say never.

Though the story and Thanos's motivations differ from the comic this can be forgiven as the new story is wafer thin but competent.

As you can imagine one of the most exciting things about Infinity War was uniting heroes we've never seen side by side and that certainly delivers on all fronts. The action is thick and fast, despite the dark overtone we have plenty of comedy and teenage Groot didn't ruin the film like I feared he would.

Obviously this is not a big finale and merely a high profile chapter in a much larger story but the movie is highly climatic regardless.

I am saddened that this wasn't a two parter, alike Civil War (2016) this was a huge story and perhaps should have been broken up across movies.

Infinity War is a contender for the best Marvel movie and instead of feeling burnt out after the never ending stream of films this has wet my appetite for more and I can't wait for the next film.

Excellent stuff, though where in the blue hell was Ant Man?

The Good:

Children of Thanos

Thanos

All out action as expected

Ties everything together nicely

The Bad:

Peter Dinklage (Never thought I'd say that)

So many characters were spread too thin

Things I Learnt From This Movie:

If Thanos and Cable ever meet its going to be super weird

Dishonest footage/photos are commonplace now (Look up the footage of Hulk in Wakanda running with the rest of the team) Seriously, never happened.

Somewhere out there right now are DC fans claiming this is a bad film",9
Still the best,29 July 2021,Even after endgame i still think this movie is superior.,10
Best superhero experience,5 September 2021,This movie is truly once in a lifetime experience.,10
Infinity Drag of this movie,6 May 2018,Wow.. can u drag this movie any more.. Killed most of the time waiting for action.. too much melodrama.. Too many character where director lost to do justice.. i would say stay away.. but it has a link to next part.. Good luck guys..,6
A Summer Film That IS Even Better Than The Hype,24 April 2018,,10
GOOD ONE BUT WITH MANY DISAPPOINTMENTS,1 May 2018,,
"Bordering on a comedy, ""Infinity War"" is overhyped, lacked direction, but at times impressed",3 May 2018,"""Avengers: Infinity War"" may well have hit the consumer sweet spot formula: the all-important kiss to boost the box office, heavy emphasis on comedy, loads of explosions, and a story that enthralls above all else. That being said, this latest installment plays it safe and rode on a long hype train spanning back over a year - Infinity War opts for the tried and true with the odd tweak thrown in, it's ambition is to be an amusing superhero popcorn flick, nothing more, nothing less; and on that count - it perhaps succeeds.

Not really accessible to new viewers of the franchise.

Infinity War is not for the entry-level viewer (if you want to fully understand it, at least) - lacking accessibility, it offers little explanation of the prior plot to the newly introduced - 31 movies have led up to this in one way or another: to an all-out fight for control of the most powerful items in existence, the infinity stones. Infinity War assumes you haven't been living under a rock and have seen (at least some of) the previous movies, to some viewers this will be a deal-breaker. So, for those reading who have no prior investment in the universe and its characters - this may be a disappointing watch. To those who have seen previous films, it still may be disappointing - the story is nothing to shout about.

Great CGI.

No, really, I will praise the special effects. Staggering stuff, and no doubt what helped make it one of the most expensive films of all time to produce.

Too many characters.

The Russo brothers were tasked the impossible job of covering a very broad cast of some 35 characters to the best of their ability within the 2 hours and 40 minutes run time, and to say the least, they were stretched thin. For the average fans, more characters is a major selling point - to those more concerned with the fluidity of the film-making and storytelling, it didn't work. The story felt somewhat fragmented as the plot's focal point kept shifting to accommodate the sheer number of characters.

It bordered on a comedy.

For some that's okay, in a film that is meant to be a culmination, the big showdown of epic proportions - I was surprised how dependent on comedy it was. I would have liked more story-building dialogue and character development instead. It didn't match the vibe of stopping a dude (Thanos) that could potentially kill trillions of people. While some of the slapstick humor was welcome, at times it went too far, it felt as if it didn't work alongside the serious scenes and situations that it often tried to segue into seamlessly - to no avail.

Geared towards a younger audience.

As a heads up, this movie without a doubt is meant to appeal towards Marvel's biggest target market - kids and early adolescents.

It makes little to no provision for those into well-written, sophisticated plotlines that transcend shooty guns and big explosions. Most of us have outgrown the cliches.

Poor ending.

Most of the audience remained seated in the cinema expecting some closure, but the credits just kept rolling.

A poor cliffhanger ending that just tries to sell the next film.

Overall 6.4/10",6
2-1/2 hrs of mindless chaos,23 May 2018,"I really liked the first Guardians of the Galaxy. Likewise Iron Man & The Avengers. But these never-ending franchise add-ons are pretty boring unless you're 12 or a CGI junkie. There's very little evidence of a story behind all of the mind-boggling action, over acted drama, and special effects. It drives me nuts anymore, when fighting takes a 5 minute 'time out' for a lame, ""poignant"" dialog scene. I guess that I've seen too many of these to enjoy them anymore.",3
Breathtaking,12 June 2018,"Infinity War does a brilliant job by seamlessly combining the last few films together. It picks up where Ragnarok left off on the space shuttle with Thor, Loki, Hulk and all the remaining Asgardians. It opens with a distress call as Thanos and his Dark Order have slaughtered most of passengers including some of the remaining Asgardians. He interrogates Thor and beats Hulk so bad he is too scared to ever turn green again. A defeated Hulk/Bruce Banner is then transported to Doctor Strange's Sanctum Sanctorum so he can warn him of Thanos' arrival. It is down to Doctor Strange, Wong, Tony Stark and Spider Man to prevent Thanos' evil minions from destroying New York and taking the time stone. It's a thrilling action sequence that introduces Starks cool new nano-bot armour that creates its own swords and shields.

Thanos has been teased since 2012 and the wait has paid off here as he is by far one of the best villains. The story is more about him achieving his goals which is refreshing to see as the villains are normally sidelined in these films. He is so determined to get all six gems, each gem making him stronger. The Avengers and Guardians have to race against time to stop him from finding all six. One sequence on his home planet 'Titan' is worth mentioning and like most of the film, it is breathtaking and tense. His crew (Dark Order) also seem unbeatable as they battle the rest of the Avengers in Wakanda with their alien army which also proves difficult. Thanos gets some interesting backstory, it would have been even better if the menacing Dark Order got some backstory themselves as we never really understand them or their motivations.

Even though it enters familiar ground, it is often done differently and most of the time it's unpredictable. It's full of surprises and twists which will leave you exhausted by the end. Although Infinity War feels over stuffed with characters and storylines, the Russo Brothers do an exceptional job by giving each character enough to do. Its great to see some focus on characters like Gamora and Thor as previous films have kept it prominently on characters Iron Man, Hulk and Captain America. That's not to say they don't get anything to do because they do, it's just not as much as usual. This entry really does require you to see all of the ones before it as it can become confusing. They often call back to previous events and storylines, so it's a better experience if you are familiar with all of them. There are also so many fun references like Rocket Racoon's need for artificial limbs, Thor's new haircut and Drax's constant quips.

There are too many visual effects shots which could have been avoided using practical effects. The CGI shots don't look bad, but sometimes they can be distracting. However it's a technique that is quicker than any other, and with studio films of this scale that's just a small price to pay. The action scenes are so well directed accompanied by a music score by Alan Silvestri who always adds that extra level of excitement to them. It is a relief to say Infinity War runs well over 2 hours 30 minutes which is the longest Marvel film. There is no point saying its ""baggy"" or ""overlong"" as fans of the franchise will greatly appreciate this and with so much going on the runtime is justified.",8
Amazing,7 January 2021,With Thanos come into play you think that the avengers would be able to tackle this problem but no. After re-watching Infinity War multiple times it still gets me because it's sad the ending really is just another cinematic masterpiece which Marvel always pull off and the fight scenes are amazing. Marvel have some of the best actors and the best casts I'm not applaud them for that. No mad Steve was just sexy after mate and I loved it a lot.,10
All Time My Favorite,31 May 2020,,10
You will know what it's like to loose.,21 March 2024,"Avengers: Infinity War is a movie that brings together a decade's worth of Marvel superheroes into a movie. The film, directed by Joe and Anthony Russo.

The movie tells the story of Thanos, a bad guy who wants to collect 6 infinity stones to become super powerful. The Avengers, who are all spread out around the universe, have to work together to stop him. Thanos is really strong and wants to bring balance to the universe in a weird way.

Even though there are a lot of characters, the movie still manages to follow everyone's story and show how they're. It's cool to see heroes from different movies meet each other for the first time, and their interactions between characters from different franchises such as the Guardians of the Galaxy meeting Thor add a delightful layer of complexity and humor to the movie.

The fights are amazing, with lots of cool special effects. The movie keeps you on the edge of your seat because the heroes are in a big hurry to save everyone and it's thrilling

This is a super exciting movie that brings together everything that's great about Marvel Cinematic Universe.",10
Extravagant clash of the titans,2 May 2018,"Have found myself liking or loving a lot of Marvel's previous work, while finding a few faults with most. It is very easy on the most part to see why they are highly regarded critically, though those more critical of their work have raised criticisms that can be agreed with by me.

Loved the first 'Avengers' film, while 'Age of Ultron' was more problematic and generally a lesser Marvel effort though still having a good deal to admire. 'Infinity War' for me was the best one, or the one enjoyed most. Would also go far to say it's one of Marvel's overall best, and a perfect example of how to do a superhero film and how to balance a large cast of characters and a lot going on. Can totally see why it has been so positively reviewed and it deserves the positive hype from personal opinion, though would hesitate in calling it flawless or one of the best films ever.

More could have been done with the very end, which felt like it ended a little too suddenly without resolving everything to full effect. It may very well have been leaving room for a follow-up, but to me it's always been dangerous somewhat to do that just in case a follow-up doesn't happen.

Scarlett Johansson also has far too little to do, with too short screen-time. Black Widow is the only character to me who felt underdeveloped and Johansson struggles to do much with it.

However, the rest of the cast are spot on. A big shout out goes to Josh Brolin, who makes for a menacing and melancholic Thanos. Speaking of Thanos, Marvel have tended to underwhelm with their villains, underwriting them and giving them vague or inconsistent motivations. Thanos is easily one of the best Marvel villains along with Hela, one of the most interesting and of surprising complexity where he is a threat but one can see his point of view.

Robert Downey Jnr, Chris Evans and Chris Hemsworth are also standouts of a near-uniformly great all-star cast. There are a lot of characters here, but somehow on the most part it didn't feel like there were too many (a big danger with films with many characters and a trap fallen into quite a lot). They hold a lot of intrigue and manage not to be too sided and true to character.

Likewise, the story is very eventful with a busy main story and several subplots. Yet it didn't feel sprawling and managed to make sense and never lose engagement. Basically it's a non-stop thrill-ride and tautly paced, with some reveals that leaves one gasping, twists that genuinely shock, rousing entrances and some of the finest action sequences of any Marvel film or any film recently, that are truly exciting and big in scale without being too noisy or exhausting. The climax is truly epic, in scale, spectacle, thrills and emotion.

'Avengers: Infinity War' hugely impresses in the script too, with snappy banter, hilarious quips (along with 'Thor: Ragnarok' this is one of the funniest Marvel films, Thor has the best of it), tension and an emotional poignancy not seen to this extent or as strongly in Marvel films. It's all intelligently handled and the humour didn't feel misplaced or inappropriate to me, this is a Marvel film that delivers on the spectacle and thrills while also having brains and heart.

Marvel never disappoints when it comes to the production values. 'Avengers: Infinity War' is not an exception. It's beautifully and atmospherically designed, slickly filmed and edited and the special effects, not overused or abused, are some of the most extravagant and spectacular for any film seen recently. It's tightly directed and dynamically and rousingly scored.

Overall, an excellent film and one of my standout viewings of all the films seen so far from the first half, and overall, of 2018. 9/10 Bethany Cox",9
The first Marvel film I really liked,8 January 2021,"The first Marvel film I really liked. Surprisingly in the film there are many spectacular scenes, which are well held and the main transition between them is made seamless, which does not make you miss.

7.9,7 September 2021,It is very hard to please everyone with a film that wraps up a whole universe. Well done.,7
The amount of people that don't understand the movie is astonishing,27 April 2018,"All the reviews that say this movie has no plot are either trolls, idiots, or didn't are to take the time to watch previous marvel movies. Every single one of those ratings and reviews should be taken down and not added to the rating for Infinity War because of their fundamental lack of understanding. It's like coming in and watching the last 2 minutes of an hour long drama show and saying this episode sucks because it has no plot. It's utterly ridiculous!

There have been 31 marvel movies leading up to this point. All 31 has have some plot that leads to infinity war. Infinity War IS the end game movie. There is nothing left to explain, nothing left to discuss, it is all-out fight for control of the most powerful items in existence, the infinity stones. There have been 31 movies to explain in someway the power of these stones and/or the heroes that come together to fight Thanos in this movie. It's like a long game of chess where Thanos finally makes his move, and it's a huge one.

So I beg of any of you who reads this. Don't listen to anyone who says this movie has no plot, has no reason and is only fighting. They aren't worth listening to, Infinity Wars has roughly 60 hours of plot from 31 precious movies leading up to this monumental fight for life or death, and the movie is done to near perfection. The movie is glorious, the CGI is fantastic, the battles are awe-inspiring, and Thanos is made worth of your fear from the very beginning. He is truly the Mad Titan that captures your heart and crushes it right in front of your eyes. Anyone who doesn't think this clearly didn't see the same movie.",10
A Balanced Review of Infinity War,24 May 2018,,7
10th movie in a row from Marvel with the same plot and gimmicks,7 May 2018,"The movie has some entertainment value, but don't believe the hype and think you're going to see an intelligent or coherent plot, something innovative, or even something you haven't seen before.

Disney/Marvel is riding the wave and releasing movie after movie (rightfully so) to get as much profit while the craze lasts. There's not much differentiating this Avengers movie from the other Marvel movies.",5
The second best movie of Marvel,29 September 2020,"I love this movie, i love it. It must gross a maximum of 2.5 billion dollars at the box office worldwide.",10

The Bar for Super Hero Cinema,17 December 2021,,9
The standard for every crossover movie,6 September 2021,"Though this is not my favorite MCU movie I think ""Infinity War"" is the best product the studio produced both because of the really high scope and because of the execution itself. I think the movie is so great because it contains almost everything you could ask (action, humor, heartfelt moments, great CGI, fantastic score, ...) in a balanced way. Furthermore even if the culmination of the MCU happened in ""Endgame"" it was here that every piece of the Marvel Universe was brought together for the first time. I remember to have an astronomical hype at the time and the fact that the movie resulted to be even better than what my hype was making envisioning me is something that I highly count. But the best part of this movie is its villain, Thanos. I loved him (and still do) and he absolutely stole the show and sets up Endgame perfectly. Clearly ""Infinity War"" has its flaws and I am not here to say it is perfect like a 10/10 rating would usually mean, but for what it represented at the time and the way it was delivered I think we couldn't have asked for more.",10
Marvellous Marvel Movie,21 February 2021,Avengers: Infinity War is surely one of the greatest superhero movies of all time. It manages to put together all our favourite superheros in one movie with epic battles and an effective and unexpected ending. It gives literal chills all over the movie. Rating: 9,9
History will tell it's true merit,31 May 2018,"The infinity war is about constant fight and That's it. I hope these fans restore their rationality soon. If this title truly deserve the current rating in the history of cinema, it is the end of the cinema. And perhaps a new era has began: mindless passive Consumerism.",6
Absolutely fabulous,29 September 2020,"The Mcu has finally shown their true potential, there has never been a movie like this before, this movie has answered many questions from the past mother, i'm sure fans will be very grateful for this movie.. 9/10",9
Overall glad I had a discount on my ticket price,28 April 2018,"I am going to say straight away I am not a die hard Marval fan as it all seems a touch far fetched for me, but having said I did enjoy the last avengers film and most recent Spiderman. However this, although not a terrible watch was as if they had given the film makers unlimited access to budget and special effects. And the result was as if every instrument in an orchestra was all playing very loudly and all at the same time. Parts felt like I was just watching a computer game and the cgi, and there was a lot of it didn't feel as good as in others. That being said there were more funny parts in this film compared to the others, but was I left thinking about it the next day? No. Would I watch it again? Not unless somebody else asked/forced me to. So overall 6 but more like a high end 5/10 than a solid 6 and I was glad my ticket price was reduced due to an offer.",6

A Stellar Introduction to the Infinity Saga's Villain,20 January 2024,,10
wow,6 January 2024,,10
Perfect mix of a lot of superheroes.,28 May 2020,"Is it possible to put a lot of superheroes together in one movie? Avengers Infinity Wars attempts that, and succeeds in spectacular fashion! All the Marvel movies before this were building up to this epic movie, and you are a fan of the Marvel movies and have been watching them, you will feel really good watching this, as a lot of favourite characters from previous Marvel movies appear here.",10
I love it!,28 January 2024,"Infinity War is a favorite among superhero fans. It tells the story of how the Avengers, Earth's mightiest heroes, confront Thanos, an Eternal, who is determined to gather all six infinity stones and wipe out half of the universe's population. The fate of the universe rests on their shoulders.

It begins with a high stakes opening sequence on a ship, where Thanos and his children are introduced with well-written dialogue and a powerful score by Alan Silvestri. The Hulk's confrontation with Thanos showcases the sheer might of the Eternal, establishing him as a formidable adversary for the Avengers.

Despite a large cast of characters, it balances them well without feeling overstuffed. It tells a compelling story in two and a half hours, maintaining consistently fast pacing. It features notable performances from actors like Josh Brolin, who plays Thanos with great intensity and Robert Downey Jr., who delivers some of the best-acted emotion in the entire MCU, adding depth to his character.

However, some parts of the movie are criticized for feeling contrived or lacking in visual appeal. For example, the moment when Starlord punches Thanos feels forced, and the CGI and aging effects on certain suits are questionable.

Despite these flaws, Infinity War is a monumental achievement in the MCU's early phases and stands as a convincing assertion that these films are indeed a form of cinema.",9
Thanos is Coming,31 January 2024,"""Avengers: Infinity War"" is a triumph that flawlessly juggles the weight of its monumental narrative with moments of uproarious humor, delivering an exhilarating rollercoaster that earns a solid 9/10.

From the outset, the film grabs your attention with a boldness rarely seen in superhero cinema. The stakes are sky-high, with the formidable Thanos looming as a threat of cosmic proportions. The Russo brothers showcase their directorial prowess, skillfully managing the massive ensemble cast and multiple storylines to create a cohesive and engaging narrative.

What sets ""Infinity War"" apart is its audacious decision to give equal weight to its villain, Thanos. Josh Brolin's nuanced performance injects the Mad Titan with a formidable presence, and the exploration of his motivations adds layers to the character beyond the typical antagonist tropes. This bold approach elevates the film, creating a genuine emotional investment in the fate of the universe.

The movie's big spectacle moments are nothing short of awe-inspiring. The visual effects are a testament to the technological prowess of the MCU, delivering jaw-dropping sequences that make full use of the cinematic canvas. The action is relentless, keeping audiences on the edge of their seats as heroes from across the galaxy unite in a battle of cosmic proportions.

Marvel Studios strikes a perfect balance between gravitas and hilarity, infusing the film with the trademark humor that has become a hallmark of the MCU. The banter between characters adds a welcome levity to the intense situations, showcasing the camaraderie and chemistry built over years of interconnected storytelling.

The plot's boldness is evident in its willingness to subvert expectations and take risks. The film doesn't shy away from exploring darker themes, resulting in emotionally charged moments that resonate long after the credits roll. The conclusion is both shocking and satisfying, leaving audiences eagerly anticipating the next chapter.

In summary, ""Avengers: Infinity War"" stands tall as a testament to the MCU's ability to deliver a cinematic event of unparalleled magnitude. This epic superhero ensemble is a must-watch for fans and newcomers alike, showcasing the unparalleled storytelling and blockbuster entertainment that has become synonymous with the Marvel Cinematic Universe.",9
the second best meme movie ever,13 December 2021,,10
Just as soulless and predictable as others but more compact,11 May 2018,"If i can somehow oversee the fact that this is just another glorified cgi fueled version of wwe, its an okay action movie.

It's still very much soulless, incredibly predictable and nothing that happens in this movie matters in any way because there can be infinite amounts of prequels and/or sequels and also, certain people can control time in any way they desire. I see that as a self-destructive element in the story, because well... nothing matters.

Whats good in this movie is, it felt more grounded to me. In other superhero movies i usually get these moments of ""wait, where are we?"" or ""wait, why are they fighting again?"". This one felt more compact to me. GOOD JOB!

That said i still don't care about anything that happened or will happen in these superhero movies. I did pay for a ticket and therefore contributed to the financing of future films though, so you're welcome.",6
BEST AVENGERS MOVIE,5 March 2024,"Avengers infinity war is an emotional roller coaster. Using the strength of its powerful and interesting villain, the movie successfully brings together the past 10 years of Marvel movies into a largely effective cocktail of super-heroic dramatics. Joe and Anthony Russo create a superhero movie that it's every bit the epic that it needs to be. However prepared you feel, you are not ready for Thanos. Infinity war is stunning, hilarious and heartbreaking. A Really Great Movie Avengers Love The Way Of Character Thanos Playing Really Enjoyed This Movie Watch This Movie Again And Again Really enjoyed Watch This Movie.",10
A snore -- literally,28 April 2018,"This film was complete and utter tosh. Judging by the way it has been positively reviewed by some other IMDB members, I cannot help but wonder if we watched the same movie. I fell asleep repeatedly during the opening night screening in my city and I lost most interest in it after 90 minutes or so. (The run time was much too long.) While I've enjoyed quite a few of these Marvel big-screen productions in recent years, I didn't enjoy this one very much at all. Unless you're a comic book fan, I'd take a pass on this one.",
The Stream of Now,28 April 2018,"How long has it been since the Dark Knight? The DC film that defined how an epic comic book fantasy could wrap a world around a hero and a villain.

Marvel have a different way of building product, and the Avengers universe has spread over many instalments. And while the last two Captain America films have escaped popcorn and can be seen as real achievements, the Avengers have kept to a more Disney comfortable spectacle.

We ride from fight to fight, changing scenes but staying firmly locked into a fantasy present with no solid meaning, much better explored in comics. But even this limited form is broken here - with the idea of a villain who is neither camp nor fickle. By developing Thanos the film actually makes it's normal limitations feel worse. There is an empty parade that is supposed to support the narrative but can only manage sputtering buddy humour and colourful mayhem. From this thin gruel we are expected to construct a framework in our minds to justify the story. While enjoying the expensive antics, the attention wanders through the inevitable plot holes, pointless scenes and rolodex of similar heroes.

Better to keep to the single dimensional tunnel of the continuous spectacle, or dare to write a proper film. This fails to do either, rendering the final scenes like a Monty Python sketch without a punchline.",6
Disturbing experience.,11 May 2018,"I am not a comics specialist and unlike most of the others I have no emotional connection to any of the hereos... so I might be biased.

I have never expected much of a story line or intrigue from a movie solely based on the heroes presence, but being recommended as a revolutionary and number one of the series I hoped for at least a bit of cheap humor and great pictures.

Yet, in the movie I've laughed twice, first time when Thor called raccoon a rabbit, and second time... when he did it again. The ending is surprising, especially for an American movie, but besides this the movie neither offers scenography comparable with Star Wars or Avatar nor any unique special effects.

There is no consistency in action, power distribution or whatsoever. One minute the same character can die from a fist hit, the other he survives an explosion of the whole planet. Once he travels the space barefoot, the other he dies from being sucked from the ship. The colorful light goes back and forth but the evil character doesnt use any of his powers most of the time just to prolong the boring fights.

Watching this movie is just distubring and frustrating.",2

Avengers: Infinity War: A Spectacle of Epic Proportions,30 January 2024,"Avengers: Infinity War, the culmination of Marvel Studios' decade-long superhero saga, stands as a cinematic masterpiece that defies expectations and delivers an exhilarating and emotionally resonant experience. The film masterfully weaves together a multitude of storylines, bringing together an ensemble of beloved Marvel heroes to confront their most formidable foe yet: Thanos, the ruthless cosmic warlord seeking to restore balance to the universe by wiping out half of all living beings.

At the heart of Avengers: Infinity War lies a complex and compelling narrative that explores themes of power, sacrifice, and the delicate balance of fate. The film challenges conventional superhero tropes, questioning the very nature of heroism and the cost of saving the world. Thanos, portrayed with chilling intensity by Josh Brolin, emerges as a formidable villain driven by a twisted sense of righteousness, adding a layer of moral ambiguity to the story.

The film's action sequences are nothing short of breathtaking, showcasing the impressive power and skill of each Avenger. From the intense clash between the Guardians of the Galaxy and Thanos's Black Order on the planet Titan to the epic showdown in Wakanda, the film delivers a visually stunning and visceral spectacle that will leave viewers on the edge of their seats.

Moreover, Avengers: Infinity War excels in its character development, giving each Avenger ample screen time to shine. We witness the growth and evolution of beloved characters like Iron Man, Thor, and Captain America, while also introducing new heroes who make their mark, including the brilliant Doctor Strange and the enigmatic Scarlet Witch.

The film's emotional impact is profound, as we witness the bonds of friendship and camaraderie forged among the Avengers tested to their limits. The loss of beloved characters is handled with sensitivity and depth, adding a layer of tragedy and realism that makes the stakes feel incredibly high.

Avengers: Infinity War's most defining moment, the one that will forever be etched in the minds of MCU fans, is the ending that leaves half of all life in the universe decimated. This shocking and heartbreaking twist serves as a devastating conclusion to the film, leaving the audience reeling with questions and anticipation for the future of the MCU.",9
Wonderful penultimate adventure,1 March 2024,"The ending began slowly for me, but everything quickly picked up steam as the film progressed. You could really empathize with the characters and feel the urgency and dread as time ticked away.

The MCU was a powerhouse before this film, and the film cemented its place in pop culture. Even if you haven't seen the movie, you've likely heard of and know what film is being referenced when someone says, ""the snap.""

Ensemble pieces really hinge on the chemistry between the cast, and everyone here played so well with each other's characters, it was a real treat to watch. It's also incredibly easy to pick up, even if you haven't kept up with the whole MCU.",9

"Great popcorn film, surprises the series with fresh takes",25 April 2018,"Well, Well, Well....

I was so ready to tear this down - 19th MCU film, too many stars, bloated CGI, first of a two parter, and so on and so on...

Yet, this is so much fun. Pure popcorn...now in the dictionary under ""popcorn film"" is just the poster for this film. Somehow, the Russo Brothers have juggled all the parts to give everyone some time in the sun. They are helped immensely by two things: the premise is so pure Mcguffin that you just watch Thanos look for Infinity Stones which gives a primal momentum and that the film's stars/characters are looking to move on - that means, actual stakes for once as people could really die and not just comic book dying either.

The DC people must be kicking themselves. The lightness and comedic touches are brilliant. You are laughing out loud, comedy level, but at totally organic character humour. It means you are so entertained throughout its rather long running time.

The other big surprise is Thanos himself. Normally, I hate CGI characters but somehow they have made Thanos and Josh Brolin work enough to give the character an actual arc. This is one of the better MCU villains and I never thought I would write that.

The stakes are real, the charisma levels are amazing, it is like ""Oceans 28"" and I can't wait for the sequel...that says an enormous amount considering the challenges this film faced.",9
THE BEST SUPERHERO MOVIE EVER!!,26 April 2018,"Engrossing, Epic, Emotional. Those are the three E's that define this movie. The latest instalment of the Marvel Cinematic Universe franchise is at its very best, culminating ten years of marvel adventure and spectacle with the biggest and most boldest movie in the superhero genre. So let's start with Anthony and Joe Russo, the geniuses that made this beast of a movie. After announcing that they will be directing the next two Avengers movies, Marvel fans knew at once that this will be the darkest Avengers movie yet. Yes, it was very dark with more of a serious tone. More than Winter Soldier and Civil War (previous marvel movies directed by the Russo Bothers) combined but they also had what the other Avengers movies had as well, the humour and it was not at all tasteless. Nobody really cared if it was necessary or not because the humour worked along with the edgy parts of the movie. This is by far the Russo brothers best work among the Marvel movies completely raising the bar of superhero movies to it's highest. Praise to Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely for writing the amazing script (they also wrote the scripts of Captain America, The Avengers, Winter Soldier, Age of Ultron and Civil War also known to be the best marvel movies). Now, the characters and story. Practically everyone that you've seen in the previous marvel movies that aren't dead, are in this movie. Everyone had the chance to shine even if it's the smallest way possible. There were so many character arcs in this movie and none of them were cut short or boring. Every scene is in the movie was worth digesting and deciphering, along with the surprises and the twists and turns that will get audiences on the edge of their seat. Everything from character development to the pacing of the storyline, makes you jump, scream, gasp or cry. And of course, the one and only, Thanos. The villain that has been teased one too many times is finally here and he delivers. Josh Brolin officially portrays the best villain in the MCU, completely pissing on Marvel's villain problem. He brings all out on the table with everything he's got. Not only will you hate Thanos by the end of the movie, but you will understand him and maybe even feel sorry for him for a few seconds. They brought layers into him that no one has seen in a movie portrayal of a Marvel villain. They made him scary and strong at the same time vulnerable and understandable. The motivation of his doing and his character development made him the best character in the movie, making the movie all about him. I cannot tell you anymore about this movie because then I would be spoiling. All I have to say is that whether you're a marvel fan or not, and if you at least know what has been going on in the previous marvel movies, GO AND WATCH IT. It will not be a waste of your time or money. Digest this to prepare for what's to come.

I may be bias once again but I just have to. I have to rate this movie 10/10. If I don't, I would be betraying myself.",10
I need a Therapist,25 April 2018,"This movie has made me feel things that I haven't about a movie in a very long time. If you are anything like me you will definitely feel a sense of ""everything is gonna be alright"" because of the generous sprinkling of light humour that makes the situation feel less serious than it actually is. The emotional roller coaster that begins right at the beginning of the movie to the very end has you feeling more and more frustrated and on edge as it goes on. Don't get me wrong this movie is absolutely stunning and amazing and a cliffhanger at the end has you wanting more and more. I'm definitely very excited to see how this storyline will carry out in the next Avengers movie.",9

Avengers: Infinity War....just WOW,20 May 2018,With the beggining of the movie it was full of surpises. What I really liked in the movie was the serious tone and the real threat hanging over the Avengers. Yes...this is THANOS ! He is an amazing villain ! MARVEL Studious show us once again that their production are spectacular visual!,10
Thanos the Emo Crybaby...Thanos Mickey Mouse Style,11 May 2018,"12 jokes within 3 minutes in conversation between Doctor Strange, Hulk and Iron Man in the beginning of movie. Too silly then super serious, switching back and forth. There were more humorous moments in this movie than any other MCU film, more than Thor Ragnarok. Avengers Infinity War should have some comedy description or category. Disney needs to stop with the excessive humor.

Thanos motive is weak and uninteresting in film. I don't recognize Thanos THE MAD TITAN from the comic books, he's too simple in this movie. LADY DEATH's influence over Thanos is more coherent. But that's what happens when a children's company takes over a sophisticated comic book company, they change the stories for kids and add lots and lots of humor.

One more thing, title of movie is incorrect. This movie is Disney's adaptation of the Infinity Gauntlet series, not Infinity War. What was the point of Disney' mixup of titles? The answer is Disney wanted to confuse people that might spoil movie with their comic book knowledge. This avoids negative reactions from social media during production to post production. 2/10 stars because of Disney's cheesy Mickey Mouse adaptation of Thanos the Emo Crybaby, Peter Quill should dance for Thanos to cheer him up.",
has a great finale,30 March 2021,My favorite part of the movie was the finale. I do not explain in order not to give Spolier. But it's not just an ordinary finale. I think the Thanos character is good.,7
Marvel's best,25 November 2021,"I saw Iron Man in the cinema when it first released in 2008, and still remember it being ground-breaking and awesome. Since then I kind of lost interest in Marvel movies in general, as their quality was very variable, with a few gems here and there. Ultimately in hindsight, the MCU is a really fun and generally well-made series of movies, with the persistent flaw of deflated stakes, contradicting rules and muddled plot points. Not quite brainless entertainment per se, but sometimes feels like that.

Avengers Infinity War reignited my interest in the MCU, as the movie itself was really well done in pretty much every way. It's genuinely a very strong movie, that is deeply rewatchable, and one of the best Space movies ever made.",9

Part by part is interesting to watch , some of scene make me shock some scene make me wanna punch people so bad. Thanos is the best villain I've ever seen. He not just normal villain to kill bunch of people because he love but his motivation so clear why he wanna do that and most people know he is collecting all the infinity stones.

One of the best part of it the team up Guardian & Avengers just amazing, full of humor cannot stop laughing watching their scene together. For 1st time my brain cannot process what going to happen in Avengers 4 really hype about it.

As I've said in an earlier review on the Avengers, you get into this superhero escalation where the next movie has to be even more threatening and the evil even more evil than in the last one. Avengers 1 was the best superhero movie ever made period. Avengers 2 fell into the problem I just noted. Avengers 3 has just way too many important characters, story lines, plot twists, issues, blah blah blah. And the motivation and plan for the villain is about as sophomoric as you can get. One good thing - Doc Strange is actually using spells now, not just body throws. There's a number of good moments in this movie but it's just way too much and at its essence way too stupid.",6

Very disappointed,2 May 2018,I'm hoping they can pull it back on the right track with the sequel.,3
A celebration of ten wonderful years of entertainment and overall fun,25 April 2018,"Avengers: Infinity War is the seventh film in Phase Three of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the nineteenth film overall. Directed by The Russo Brothers (Captain America: The Winter Soldier and Captain America: Civil War), it is truly a terrific film of its kind and a near-perfect culmination of everything the cinematic universe has been building up to for ten years.

Two years after the events of Captain America: Civil War, the Avengers team remain a fractured group of heroes, with some completely dropping off the radar altogether. However, one day, the powerful intergalactic tyrant Thanos (Josh Brolin) arrives on Earth to complete his collection of Infinity Stones, which upon acquiring all six, will allow him to control half of the known universe. With time quickly running out, The Avengers must reunite and team up with the Guardians of the Galaxy to put an end to Thanos' unquenchable thirst for power.

Avengers: Infinity War is more than a typical MCU superhero film. It is a celebration of ten wonderful years of entertainment and overall fun. While the film does struggle with some tonal shifts during the first act, its brilliant action scenes and clever dialogue more than make up for these shortcomings. The film's ending will be overwhelming to some and most likely will divide fans over how it is executed. Directors Anthony and Joe Russo do a superb job developing Thanos' personality outside of simply wanting universal domination. His motivations feel somewhat morally ambiguous and at times even make him seem sympathetic. Despite the film's darker tone, there are still some hilarious scenes of banter among the heroes, particularly between Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) and Steven Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch). As is the tradition, be sure to stay after the credits for one bonus scene.

I rate it a solid 9/10",9

An outstanding watch,23 January 2021,"This is exactly the sorta thing I want from an Avengers film! Full blown, no punches pulled action. In that regard, it's an outstanding watch!

Despite knowing practically little about the MCU up until a few weeks ago, I still knew this was a film that was going to see - so to speak - excrement hit the fan... and boy did it! It's a great ride.

Like 'Captain America: Civil War' did, 'Avengers: Infinity War' does an incredible job at juggling the gargantuan number of characters. It's ridiculous, but totally awesome, how many faces we see appear again. I thought they got the screen time for all, more or less, down to a T. Not an easy job, that.

Speaking of the cast, it's Robert Downey Jr., Chris Hemsworth and Josh Brolin who stand out most in my memory. Them three are excellent, especially the latter. Away from those lot, it's very cool to see all the other worlds - including from 'Doctor Strange' and 'Guardians of the Galaxy' - come together into one film. As for new additions, there aren't many - Peter Dinklage being the pick.

There are many references that I had already become aware of just via the internet, so it was quite amusing seeing them all unfold here and there. The effects looked great to me, as they have basically all the way up until this point of the MCU. The comedy is good again, also.

Needless to say, I can't wait to see 'Avengers: Endgame'!",9
"Good story, but lack of entertainment",9 May 2018,"I dip in and out of the Marvel Universe as after a while they all seem to follow the same trend. Hero is loses. Hero comes back even stronger. Big fight. Hero wins.

However, the good thing about a cross over is that there is a bit more of a story, and that statement is certainly true with Avengers Infinity War.

Overall, I enjoyed it. The story was good and I like that the ending wasn't a cop out and that it sets up for another. However, of the 20+ Marvel Hero's this film introduces, about 6 of them have decent air time. I love that Thor teamed up with the Guardians, this made for great comedic viewing, but for fans of the Black Widow and Captain America, prepare to be disappointed. The Capt punches some people and looks sad, BW has ' a girl fight' (which to me seems put in there, purely to please female viewers (which I doubt it will)).

To sum this up in a sentence, it was a good film with an enjoyable story line and certainly continued the Marvel world, however, IT WAS NOT ENTERTAINING!!!! It will be a very long time till I watch it again, if ever.",6
Waste of Time,13 May 2018,"Marvel seems to be on a roll towards killing off this franchise. The previous entry...Black Panther...was, generously, just OK but Av:IW was just awful. This entry was abt an hour too long and way too slow to develop. I had trouble staying awake at times. The final battle scene was OK but the entire movie was dark. I don't mean the theme, I mean the pucture itself was dark. So dark that in some interior scenes it was difficult to see what was going on. Save your time and money.",2

Absolute Perfection - Exceeds All Expectations and Blows You Away. Best Marvel Film Yet.,28 April 2018,"TL;DR

A phenomenal achievement - 10 years of films leading up to this has been worth it


Simple story allowing so much to be packed in


Infinity Stones are more than just dull McGuffins






















--------------------------------------------------------------

Wow. Just wow. For a film that generates so much hype in the months running up to its release, it's incredible when it not only meets expectations, but exceeds them to the point where even more hype is garnered. There are so many words to describe Marvel's latest - emotional, epic, fun, stressful, scary, hilarious, incredible. In about 2 and a half hours you will laugh, you will cry and you will cheer. It's a phenomenal achievement, the biggest marvel of Marvel yet, and a huge round of applause is warranted to everyone involved in the film. You don't need to be a fan to love this film.

It's a very simple story without lots of twists and turns, making it very easy to follow - that is, provided you've seen all (or at least most) of the films so far. For those who have been at least casually following this monumental cinematic series, everything will make sense and the characters are already known. By letting the previous films set everything up, that allows Infinity War to pack so much more in the film and just get on with it from the word 'go'. The ever-important Infinity Stones themselves are much more than simple McGuffins - the film makes the audience care about them, Thanos visibly becoming stronger with every one he collects. It's not just as simple as Thanos collecting six stones, however. Instead this doesn't follow the usual superhero story or structure, instead being utterly unpredictable, allowing the audience no respite or way to prepare for the madness that occurs. This is a very different type of superhero film, Marvel able to break away from the mould. This is a strength of the film and they absolutely do not shy away from it. This is best seen in the ending which will go down in history, along with the likes of The Italian Job. It's a bold, brave finale - in a way I would have preferred a slightly more rounded end, but the film is too daring for that, instead setting things up for Avengers 4 perfectly (even in the post-credits scene).

Considering there are over 30 characters the audience will recognise, the directors and writers have done an excellent job of balancing the characters, all seen through the structure of the film itself. Structured more like an episode of Game of Thrones, we follow different groups of characters as the climax slowly comes to a head. One moment we'll be with Iron Man, Dr Strange and Spider-Man, the next we're journeying across the galaxy with Thor and the Guardians, and next we find ourselves with Cap, Falcon and Black Widow. No character seems particularly side-lined or unimportant and the structure allows for each and every character to make a solid contribution and get their fair share of screen-time.

Whereas Age of Ultron had more of an emphasis on story rather than characters, Infinity War is the complete opposite, the characters coming together instead being the main point of the film itself. It's a relief then that, besides all characters having a fair amount of time, they are all fantastic and an absolute joy to see all together in one film, every group seeping excellent chemistry. It never feels forced or gimmicky, but instead authentic and natural to see them all team up and work together. It also emphasises how perfectly cast all the characters have been over the years, able to hold their own and interact with everyone else so brilliantly. With so many characters, a film like this shouldn't work, but incredibly it does and is all the better for it. None of the groups are ever the default boring one (unlike Frodo and Sam in Lord of the Rings), but they are all lovable characters with exciting plot lines. On top of that they're all hilarious. As ever, Drax might be the funniest; but there are jokes from Stark, Strange, Quill, Groot, Rogers, Okoye... the list is endless. In a film with so much heart and action, it's amazing they managed to fit in so much comedy. It's beginning to sound like a cliché, but this is absolutely the funniest Marvel film yet - certainly funnier than the majority of ""comedies"" that come out these days. Even the new character Eitri played by Game of Thrones' Peter Dinklage gets his share of laughs. The biggest surprise with regards to characters however is Thanos. While his cohort may be formidable yet fairly bland (with the exception of the brutally sinister and downright scary Ebony Maw, played by Tom Vaughan-Lawlor), Infinity War's central villain Thanos is an exceptional antagonist, brilliantly played by Josh Brolin. As terrifying and intimidating as the monstrous purple alien may be, there is a quiet, emotional side to him. Unlike many villains, he's not looking for power for the sake of power. There's an element of humanity to him and he genuinely believes that what he's doing is for the good of the universe. This is not an antagonist to add to the ever-growing annals of forgettable villains - Thanos is the formidable foe we needed and wanted. No longer will Loki be the best Marvel bad guy by default. Will he go down as the best superhero villain since the Joker?

Of course it's not all laughs and chasing stones. As expected in a film like this there's action - lots of action. It's appropriate that the word 'war' appears in the title since this is by far the most action-packed Marvel film we've seen. Despite the nigh-on non-stop action, it never gets boring or seems like too much. With a rich plethora of characters comes a wide variety of action and fighting styles. No two characters fight in the same way and so the action always seems fresh. It's a pleasure seeing all these characters we have grown to love come together and fight with one another. The CGI and fight choreographing is incredible and the battle scenes are beautifully filmed. Definitely worthwhile being seen in IMAX!

The biggest downside is having to wait a year to find out what happens next, with no clues in the upcoming Ant-Man and the Wasp or Captain Marvel in the interim (since they're set before the events of this film). Still, if the next Avengers film is anything like Infinity War we're in for another incredible treat. With terrific character interaction, hilarious comedy, sublime action and a shocking ending that will keep you awake at night - it's all perfect. The 10 years Marvel has spent leading up to this has been absolutely worth it. A splendid and monumental achievement. All hail Marvel - but beware, Thanos will return...",10
Don't know what they were thinking.,1 June 2018,Mashing all superheroes and hoping that it will work?,6
The Marvel punch,3 May 2018,"When I was a kid just after watching Superman II that one day there will be a film that will have in it, Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman as well as other DC Comics superheroes but it will knocked out of the park by a Marvel film starring the Hulk, Spiderman, Thor, Iron Man and others I would had not believed you. Heck Black Panther did twice more business in the US box office than the Justice League film.

Usually villains in superhero films want power just to destroy everything. Thanos the villain wants to bring chaos and destroy what seems half the population of the worlds in order to bring a new order of peace and prosperity. No more starving kids scavenging for food. It is a Nazi way of thinking, we get people in social media platforms who go on about how we need to control the population growth to save the planet. So reduce the population in Africa, in Asia in the Middle East. You know find a way to get rid of those black and brown people! Well Stan Lee who created a lot of the Marvel characters is Jewish and knew about the perils of this Nazi way of thinking.

Thanos wants his infinity stones to get ultimate power. You might think he has never loved something or anyone but he need to make sacrifices himself. His quest for the stones sees him battling Thor at the start of the film. Along the way their are casualties which leaves you wondering what will happen to those individual Marvel films in the future.

The Russo Brothers have certainly made a film where the various characters from the Marvel universe coming together feel natural and organic. Just look as to how well the Guardians of the Galaxy characters gel with Thor or Tony Stark.

They also have made the film so well paced although the running time is a tad overlong. It starts with action scenes and the action scenes crop up in this film relentlessly but we also get humour and brief character moments but always you know this is a comic book adaptation.",9

An amalgamation of crap,13 May 2018,"Two and half hours later, I walk out after watching the, what I thought was the closing credits only to now read about there being more of the movie, following the rollout of the credits.

As to the movie itself, a jumbled mess, some confusing CGI and more characters that you can poke a stick at.

All up, probably should have waited until released on Foxtel or Netflix.",2

One of the best Movie MCU,30 September 2020,"A tape of incomparable magnitudes. An unprecedented superhero odyssey. This seems to me the best way to describe this film, which takes the limits of the genre to a new level. In a world like today where superhero cinema dominates the market, even more so the movies from Marvel Studios, it can often be difficult to surprise. However, Infinity War not only creates this emotion inherent in a movie of these characteristics, but it brings together the best that Marvel has built over ten years and mixes it in an organic as well as frantic and impressive way every second. It is a film that is practically constant action, like many of the genre, but with a speech and an emotional weight greater than that seen on other occasions. A special care is appreciated in forming a convincing story with enough dramatic and sentimental value, at the same time that the narrative action does not stop. 'Avengers Infinity War' is first and foremost a superhero movie that embraces the genre and exploits it to the fullest. A film with great ambitions that is capable of surpassing itself, resulting in one of the best films in the studio and in the genre itself.",8

Speechless!,19 June 2018,"Without a doubt the most complete cinematic experience I've had since The Dark Knight in 2008, only on a much grander scale. A phenomenal acheivement by everyone involved.",10
It's odd how dull a film stuffed with action can be.,4 December 2018,"I wanted so much to like this film but for me it came out as too knowing, self referential and repetitively dull. Mark Ruffalo seems to have changed his character for the worst, Chris Prat/The Guardians of the Galaxy are beyond annoying and several others are badly under used. Also for me Thanos was too human.",6
The Best MCU film; a masterpiece,19 August 2021,"Avengers: Infinity War is a film so powerful and good that instead of being crushed by the weight of its expectations, it lifted them up and launched them out into space. Packed with epic, intense action, fantastic character work, and a powerful ending, it doesn't get much better then this. It's especially remarkable when you remember just how much buildup there was to this film and how massive the expectations were, you would think it would be almost impossible to meet, but Infinity War does it so well it makes it look easy.

The story is exhilarating, it moves at a brisk pace which really makes you feel the immense stakes and how urgent the situation is. Every single character is handled extremely well and are all in character. The film makes sure to pay attention to what spot they're in in their character journey since the last film each respective character was in and continues their development. It maintains continuity and brings every character together in a way that's organic and serves the story perfectly. Tony Stark finally gets to fight the thing he has been tormented by and preparing for years to fight, Steve Rogers and most of the other Avengers are fugitives of the law and thus are more rugged, Bruce Banner is still dealing with his conflict with the Hulk (continuing what was established Thor: Ragnarok), Thor is dealing with the grief of losing everything, manifesting in personal vengeance towards Thanos, and much more. But perhaps the best thing about the film is the characterization of Thanos, one of the best villains in cinema since Darth Vader from Star Wars (which was the intent of the Russos, specifically saying that the wanted to make ""the next Darth Vader""). He is a ruthless, insane and narcissistic monster, but he still has honorable traits, respects his enemies, he has a very flawed perspective of how to save the universe but believes it whole-heartedly, and even a fatherly love towards Gamora. He's terrifying but also humanized, and it just works perfectly.

The computer generated effects, especially those that brought Thanos to life, are perfect, as is the soundtrack. While MCU scores are typically regarded as forgettable, Alan Silvestri's score for Infinity War is anything but. The performances are impeccable as well, there's not a single unsatisfying or uneven performance. Josh Brolin as Thanos, Robert Downey Jr. As Tony Stark, Chris Hemsworth as Thor, Chris Evans as Steve Rogers, Chris Pratt as Peter Quill, Benedict Bumberbatch as Doctor Strange, Elizabeth Olsen as Wanda and Zoe Salanda as Gamora in particular stick out to me and knock it out of the park.

In conclusion, Infinity War is the best MCU film and one of the best films to have come out in the past 10 years, and I don't think you could ask for more. Infinity War (along with its sequel, Avengers: Endgame) isn't just a movie, it's an experience.",10
i wish i was as simple-minded as the grown-ups who are raving about this movie,7 May 2018,"Yea, Infinity War is not a bad movie, it's semi-fun.. but that's about it..

boring,3 May 2018,This movie was kind of like an episode of TWD. Just a bunch of people chit-chatting with each other with boring action sequences.

The Best Marvel Movie,20 July 2020,10 Years of Build Up wasn't wasted on this Movie. Infinity War is one of the greatest movies of all time because of how carefully they set everything else up.

"Good movie, but completely ruined",28 April 2018,,
Another typical Marvel movie,10 November 2018,"Fairly bland plot considering that it is currently ranked as the 51th best film of all time on imdb. Not much character development but I guess that is what the sequals are for. The consequence of that is that the film really feels like another filler movie to cash out more on the Marvel universe. Hence the ending of the film of course.

Avengers infinity war does some good like showing different sides of the antagonist, explaining his motives and the reasoning behind them (unlike that stupid villain in Justice League), and making him do challenging decisions. I also liked the dialouge between the superheroes, especially the Guardians of the galaxy crew and Thor. Their scenes were really funny and I like the fact that humor is a central part between these characters, it makes the movie stick out from other typical superhero action movies, and it shows that it doesn't take itself so seriosuly. Those were some original points that stood out to me and made me not rate it a 3/10.",7
The Villain makes the movie work,5 May 2018,"Infinity War is movie number 19 in the current installment of the MCU. Some say that the movies have lost steam. Or that they're burnt out on superhero movies. To those naysayers, Infinity War may not be enough to revitalize their interest. But to anyone who still loves Marvel movies, Infinity War is a welcome and satisfying addition to the collection.

There was good reason to be concerned about this movie. The marketing pitch pegged it as the most ambitious crossover event in history, which sounds kind of cool but also comes with its share of challenges.

Crafting a story that juggles this many characters seems impossible, and choosing the correct combinations of heroes to group together is tricky. Finding a villain worthy of taking on the entire universe worth of Avengers is perhaps the most daunting of all.

I worried about each of these going in. After seeing the movie, I can comfortably say that Infinity War delivered on all fronts.

Thanos (a commendable Josh Brolin), delivers in a huge way as the star baddie. He's the key to whole movie. It does not work if he doesn't deliver. Fortunately, he does.

The plot revolves around Thanos and his pursuit of the six Infinity Stones, which he hopes to use to eliminate half the population of every planet in the universe. Most would call this genocide. He calls it mercy. He believes if life remains unchecked, populations will grow too large and civilizations will eventually suffer and starve.

So, it's up to the Avengers to stop him. You get the idea.

For as crazy as Thanos may sound, he comes across as a somewhat reasonable guy at times. His past even makes him empathetic. Also, and this is absolutely crucial, he's scary. Every time he appears on screen, the audience knows that anyone could die. Any Avenger could die. Thanos is that powerful and that ruthless.

Though all characters did not receive as much screen time as they deserve, this was only the case because so many characters deserve and have had their own movies. Kudos to the Russo brothers for handling the situation as well as could possibly be expected.

The character pairing choices were brilliant. Fortunately, Marvel benefits from the fact that the funniest Avenger, Thor, also happens to be the Avenger most likely to end up in space for a meeting with the hilarious Guardians.

The group immediately strikes a comic chemistry, as Starlord struggles to maintain his confidence as his crew oohs and aahs over the hunky Thor. Spiderman and Ironman boast a similar dynamic. Peter calls Tony ""Mr. Stark"" and Tony calls Peter ""kid."" There's a certain father-son/mentor-protégé sort of never completely clear vibe that lends itself to comedic gold, especially when Spiderman proves himself to be as capable as anyone else, despite his age. Tom Holland is distinguishing himself as far and away the best Spiderman ever.

Nearly all the good guys and gals have their chance to showcase their skills (except for a couple absences, which I won't name). Captain America, the Guardians, and Black Panther all receive well-deserved grand entrances. The filmmakers did such a great job using music to smooth the transitions in a few key scenes without overdoing it. You can probably guess which ones get their walk-up music.

Looking back, this movie opens with a bang and never really lets up until the credits roll. It's fun, funny, thoughtful and fulfilling. I only have three complaints.

1. I don't care about the romance between Vision and Scarlet Witch. They seem like fine people, but I just can't get there. Romance is not why I watch these movies. Also, her calling him ""Vizz"" is objectively hilarious, even though that wasn't the intention. 2. There's one scene with Thanos and Gamora that felt clunky and thin. This becomes problematic because it's pivotal to their relationship and the rest of the movie. You'll know what I mean when you see it. 3. The movie has a problem with stakes. Are there any? Again, you'll know what I mean when you see the movie.

Despite my minor gripes, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. It seems like most viewers did. Join the phenomenon and see Infinity War today. If you love superheroes, you will probably love this movie.",8
Thoughts,21 January 2019,"Infinity war was a bit sloppy with its character development and story telling, but reasonably successful at jamming so many characters together and keeping it funny and mostly entertaining without making it feel like a comedy. Despite its length, the movie kept enough humor and action to keep you interested and kept the movie from dragging.",6
One of the biggest loss of time lately,6 May 2018,"I was so angry after watching that I had to write something. Boring boring boring, the biggest reason for that is scenario 0/10. It is too long, if I hadn't go to cinema and bought ticket there is no way I would have patience to watch it until the end. Everything already seen in previous marvel movies, it seems that every new is even worse with lower quality and I didn't even have big expectations before the movie. The main reason I decided to watch it is IMDB rate 9/10 which is total fraud and paid advertisement. There is no guarantee if some character is dead that he will remain dead, everyone could resurrect...Go watch anything else than this. My last marvel movie for sure, so angry that I don't watch american movies in cinema any more, all the same, low quality in recent time, just to make many fast, without proper scenario...bull..it",2
A Decade of A Masterpiece_Breathtaking and Heartbreaking,29 April 2018,"Never in my life have I loved a movie so much I needed to see it again immediately after I watched it. My friend was still mourning the character deaths, so I took her home, bought another ticket and went straight back to that theater. This movie is marvelous. Not only am I a hardcore Marvel fan, but I am also a film student and a writer. I absolutely admire and give my applaud to Marvel, for having the patience, the courage, the directors, the producers, the cast, and the crew spending a decade turning 70 years worth of comics into this beloved franchise that brought those stories and characters to life.

I'm going to do my best to keep this short and sweet, without spoilers. This movie should be getting nothing but appreciation and praise. This movie is for the fans, not trolls, not critics. The Russo brothers did exceptional, balancing each character perfectly to their own spotlight. Nothing felt over done or unnecessary, every moment was completely motivated and executed beautifully. The character pairings were well thought out, mended well, the character growth and interactions were fun, and I nearly lost it from excitement. Any scene with Thanos was amazing and stressful, his character arc was well developed and almost made me feel for his gentle side, but whenever he walked on screen I was scared for the heroes lives!! The actors, as always, were incredible, but their performances in Infinity War were outstanding, they all deserve Oscars. Despite the few heartwarming jokes and banter, the movie never shifted from it's serious tone, which I appreciate, as the actors held strong emotional moments that will undoubtedly leave you teary-eyed and heartbroken. This movie will leave you laughing, it will leave you shocked by the twists and turns, it will possibly leave you gasping horrified (like me) or screaming (like some fans), and the ending will leave you emotionally crippled by the cliffhanger, but you will be awestruck.

The only thing that I wish was a little different was I wish the score was a little less dramatic and more softer and powerful to deliver that emotion further. I wish they got Hans Zimmer to score the Avengers, but I'm not removing a star for that, because all in all Avengers: Infinity War is a masterpiece, and it takes a lot for me to called a movie a masterpiece, even if its Marvel, but Infinity War pasted all expectations. Do not miss this experience. It is satisfying in all ways and never disappointed me. Now go buy that ticket and enjoy this unique, special, and phenomenal film!",10
Best movie,12 May 2022,"Avengers: Infinity War is easily the best MCU movie of all time. Even with Spider-Man: No Way Home and Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, Infinity War stays on top.",10

After ten years of MCU build-up this is the impressive first finale,23 November 2021,"""Avengers: Infinity War"" culminates the 10 years build-up of the MCU to this first part finale:

The villain is very powerful, complex and interesting to watch, although his final art design is not that impressive as other impressive versions of Thanos.

There is a lot of super-hero drama, a lot of apocalyptic atmosphere, a lot of smart subplots and impressive locations, there is a lot of surprise.

The movie is very watchable and constructed somehow around best-of-scenes, very fast-paced, jumping from one important fight and conflict to another leaving behind some logic. The action and the SFX are impressive, I as a viewer have nearly none time to chill out, it's a tour de force till the final battle. Very courageous by the makers to finish this movie as a Part 1-movie of a 2-part-finale (just like the new ""Dune"" movie by Denis Villeneuve in 2021).

It's a good MCU movie (it's better than the second part ""Avengers: Endgame"") that relies on the former MCU movies to keep it as a fast-paced, gripping story till the end.

Highly recommended.",9
"""Avengers: Infinity War"" Raises the Bar for All Superhero Films",28 March 2023,"""Avengers: Infinity War"" is a stunning achievement in the superhero genre that has raised the bar for all future comic book adaptations. Directed by the Russo brothers, the film delivers an epic, action-packed adventure that is both thrilling and emotionally resonant.

The film boasts an impressive ensemble cast, featuring a vast array of iconic superheroes from the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The characters are expertly woven together in a complex and layered story that is surprisingly cohesive and easy to follow. The performances are top-notch, with each actor bringing depth and nuance to their respective roles.

One of the film's standout elements is its stunning visual effects. The action sequences are breathtakingly choreographed, with the use of CGI seamlessly blended with practical effects. The film's colorful, vibrant palette adds to the sense of excitement and wonder, while the use of music creates a powerful emotional connection with the audience.

Despite its heavy action and special effects, ""Avengers: Infinity War"" does not skimp on character development and emotional depth. The film's exploration of complex themes such as sacrifice, loyalty, and the nature of power elevates it above the standard superhero fare.

Overall, ""Avengers: Infinity War"" is a masterful superhero epic that is both thrilling and emotionally impactful. It's a must-see for fans of the genre and a testament to the power of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.",10
sad =(,19 August 2021,,10
Better than expected but still has flaws,6 May 2018,"Overall, I liked this movie. It was fun, awesome, and a great watch. I was worried that this would be another huge dissapointment for me like Civil War was, where the trailer was better than the movie. I have to say, they handled his movie pretty well. Still, there are huge pacing issues but it's a comic book movie with a lot of characters so i've got to give it a pass. But my biggest problem with the movie is that it doesn't feel like an ""Avengers"" movie- they're all split up and such. The theme barely plays and when it does it doesn't feel quite right. The Russos don't really understand what the Avengers are, based on this movie. It doesn't feel quite as complete as the previous two. Well, this was a good movie, worth the hype, but I hope they improve for the next and final one. Part 2 is usually better, right?",7

"Ok, fellow fans. Here we are.",3 November 2021,"After 10 years of buildup and hype surrounding every movie that came out, We are finally here. The big showdown we've been waiting for since 2008. I, unfortunately, didn't get to see this in the theaters, but I got it the day it came out on Blu-Ray and watched it with some friends and fellow fans of the MCU. And.... Wow. In a good way. This knocked my socks off. This wasn't Joss Whedon like the first two (I might be wrong), but this was just as visually stunning and had the same effect. The end was a punch to the gut. A hard one. Anyway, the beginning was unlike any Marvel movie I'd ever seen. Thanos torturing Thor and killing Loki made lots of sense, since they had just seen Thanos's ship at the end of Thor: Ragnarok, and it was brutal to watch, and really made you hate Thanos right from the start.

The middle was just as good, with some lighthearted moments like the Guardians' entrance (my personal favorite after Thor's to Wakanda) and some funny scenes with the Guardians (""Are you mocking me?"") and the action scenes in New York with some banter involved with Spiderman. The part where Thor forges Stormbreaker was one of the most epic scenes in the whole MCU, and we finally got to see Groot do something other than play his game, which was needed.

Thor's entrance to Wakanda, though... It's indescribable. I got chills then and I get chills just thinking of it now. Remember, the other Avengers (Cap, Black Widow, etc.) hadn't seen him in 2+ years, and he looked AWESOME (as always).

Thanos, the villain, is my second favorite after Killmonger (Black Panther). He thought he was doing the right thing by trying to wipe out half the universe, and as much as we hated him, we sympathized with him. He was a great villain with really realistic motives, and the CGI, OH, MAN. Was it stunning. Every scene felt realistic, and I felt the power in every move and every blast that a character took. None of it felt fake

Quite possibly the most overrated movie of 2018... maybe the entire decade,29 June 2018,"Before I bought the tickets for this, I was amazed, to say the least, by the high ratings at this site. Still being rather skeptic, the ride started, and it actually seemed promising in the beginning. As the movie proceeds, however, it felt for me like a bunch of characters fighting, in a typical ""good vs. evil"" manner, while the bad guy, who had so much more potential, seems to be utterly evil with some seemingly emotional moments of redemption mixed in. The atmosphere in the movie IS dark, much darker than the previous Marvel movies, actually. There was an ""apocalyptic"" feeling throughout the entire movie. However, I was still shocked by the public that showed many emotions during the screening. There was something I probably missed in the movie. I have the feeling that Marvel Studios simply used some ""plot holes"" inside this movie for the sake of commercialization and further production of the MCU movies. Regardless, I would recommend watching this because many people find this to be the best thing that ever happened to the MCU.

Just Amazing,29 October 2020,I'm not used to watch English films but this film got so much popularity that it made to watch it. I too fan of avengers but not regular in their series but this film just made my day. So you too should watch it. It's really amazing.,9
Unashamedly giving it a 1 to bring balance,2 August 2018,"This movie deserves no more than a 7 on IMDB. I could maybe still handle a 7.5. Maybe. Compare it to the greats that scored over 8 people. Cmon really? It is a slightly above average marvel movie, that's it.",7
Hard to score due to lack of story,4 June 2018,"Producers focused so much on visual effects and getting all the 'stars', that they forgot the important thing; the plot. Almost three unnecessary hours to get to an ending of a 'story' that stayed just as it started.",3
Third best film in the series,7 November 2021,They actually did a really good job of working with so many different characters. Kept me interested. Enjoyable to watch. Humor where there was time. Nice to see failure and loss and the pain in Tony Stark's eyes. I don't really like what they did with the hulk. So much better than age of Ultron and end game. Enjoys screen time with iron Man and Spider-Man.,9
Horrific villain,5 March 2022,"Best villain on MCU also the introduction of them was top notch showing how horror and terrifying he was. So many epic / nerve wracking scene, love how many characters in this movie and they still got so much screen time with no too fast impression, very well written screenplay.

Would give 8.5 but there's no half here.",8

A crowd pleasing moment,21 December 2021,,8
Exceeds Expectations,7 April 2022,"While the specials effects are spectacular, it's the writing, the overarching plot and how everything comes together so organically after so many years that makes this phase exceed the superhero genre. No spoilers, but this movie subverts every Hollywood movie cliche that has ever preceded it and proves you can produce works of art in any genre.",10
As Mediocre As Expected,15 July 2018,"I wasn't going to bother with a review but then I read the first review by blparker that said everyone giving this a bad score were trolls who didn't see the film, then went on to praise it like it was Citizen Kane. I found that rather humorous. My suggestion is to see this in the theatre as the VFX are the only thing it has going for it and won't translate on the small screen. I had no idea this was a 2 hr and 40 min film until I bought the ticket and I seriously contemplated walking into another film because I just did not expect much from this film. When the film started it poorly leapt straight into a scene as if we were in the middle of the movie rather than the beginning. It didn't make a lot of sense other than a set up for on of the long-standing characters to die. Once we moved past this terrible scene it got a little better, which kept me in my seat 'cause the first 10 mins of the film made me want to leave the movie as I was afraid the rest of the film would be like this. It doesn't get much better but at the very least it manages to be entertaining.

There is a plot, though, there is very little to it. If you know anything of the Infinity comic, which also was not that great, you know that a lot of characters die. The difference is they killed characters in the comic I cared about and the movies they don't even bother to have those characters, so, whatever. Secret Wars was a much better comic and tells how Spider-Man got his black suit, but it had actual story, so, I guess they didn't want to use a better comic. Infinity truly is one big dude fight. But not even that exciting of action. I thought the Black Panther action was better. I'd read that a bunch of guys don't like Rey from Star Wars because she's a Mary Sue, which I learned means a woman with ultimate, unstoppable powers. Funny, I've never heard a name for guys but they bothered to come up with one for women. Basically, every dude in this film is a Mary Sue. If Thor has the power to resist a star how is it he can't get out of a couple steel girders a wizard wraps around him? How is Captain America always so invincible? He was always kind of a lame character but now he's all-powerful in this universe. Why is Spider-Man suddenly Iron Man? What is the point of Vision, for someone so powerful he doesn't seem to do much other than whine.

I did think Dr. Strange was cooler than his own movie in this film. Tony Stark, always likable. Thor was very enjoyable, and I loved his scenes with the Star Jammers. Peter Parker's humor was funny and I liked him better in this film than Homecoming. The best scenes for me were the Guardians of the Galaxy crew. Pretty much everything they do is good. The best comedic line was from the bald Black Panther woman, which, unfortunately they didn't show that much of her. In fact, this was a 2 hr 40 min movie with only 2-3 minutes of screen time for the few female characters they've bothered to add to the film Marvel Universe, who are mostly only in the films to make the guys not look gay. The Scarlett Witch seemed to be one of the most powerful characters yet her few scenes were only dedicated to talking about how much she loves Vision and fawning all over this boring robot guy who doesn't seem to have emotion. Yep, a real attractor for women. Black Widow has been lame from the start. A Shield Agent with no powers whom they've given laser guns to, on the team with a bunch of super powered dudes and a god. Lame. There's a long assortment of Marvel super power females they could have added to Avengers but they literally just added someone to look hot. It really annoyed me how underused all the female characters were in this film. Black Panther's sister was the star of the Black Panther film and she has no purpose in the Avenger film other than to cut out Vision's stone. She's basically an extra.

I've never kept much up on Thanos 'cause he's a relatively boring character who wasn't very often used in the Marvel universe for the 10 years I read Marvel comics. I think he was more of a Silver Surfer or Rom villain...which, did anyone actually read those? I thought the idea that balance is used as bad and evil was a bad message. What is he now, an eco-terrorist? He didn't seem so much crazy as a Green Peace dude with too much power. Thanos chose people at random so he wasn't a racist, a bigot, or anything else, he was by the films portrayal an environmentalist. Humans thin out animals when they ravage the terrain. How is it different? I go to films to be entertained, not have these poorly plotted out existentialism by stoners moments. In the past 6 months, Infinity War, Jurassic World, and The Last Jedi all had these nihilist themes or moments where they are trying to express some weak, childish form of morality but it is actually anti-heoric, selfish, immoral, or just lame.

I, in some way applaud the writers for making the film mildly entertaining despite the amount of characters they were working with. That is a challenge. But, overall there wasn't much story going on or actual emotion so I really didn't care when they killed off a good chunk of the heroes. All I could think was, ""Oh, his contract is up, so they're killing him off. They didn't use her anyway, so, of course she's dead. Oh, well, he's a new actor every 2 or 3 movies, so, no surprise."" Didn't care. The entire film was fairly unmemorable and my life could have continued just fine without seeing it.",6
Amazing film. Amazing Cast!,28 December 2018,"An almost perfect movie!! For a long time, we're waiting for a superhero movie that is not clichéic and boring, and we have Deadpool,but Infinitty War is a visual show, and it's worth our time. I can hardly wait for Avengers Endgame next year",9
Bad Movie,31 December 2018,,6
What an Awful Movie.,21 May 2018,"This movie is such a disappointment that I don't know where to start: 1) Lack of story line 2) Disorienting camera work in fight scenes 3) Zero amusing/comical value scenes

This movie doesn't give you anything to keep you engaged. I fell asleep 3 times during the movie and couldn't wait to get out the show. I have thoroughly enjoyed other Avengers movies and Thor Ragnarok recently. This has just been the worst Marvel movie to date.

Only thing going for it is that you can see all the Marvel superhero characters at once.",3
"The perfect culmination of 10 years, but you can't please everyone.",1 May 2019,"As a lifelong fan of the comics and a fan of the movies since Iron Man, I loved this film. It will lose you if you have not been paying attention up until this point and it has obviously polarised audiences, but it is a masterpiece of directing and scriptwriting. I can't wait to see where we go from here.

If you've enjoyed marvel thus far, you'll find a lot to like. It is a marked improvement on the story from the old comic!

I suspect people score movies low to bring the average down and yet Infinity War still currently stands at 8.9/10! That alone should tell you all you need to know about the quality of this movie.

It won't be for everyone, but no movie is! For me, it was perfect. Exciting, moving and thoroughly enjoyable. A triumph.",10

Better one from marvel,28 November 2023,"""Avengers: Infinity War"" is a monumental culmination of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It's a rollercoaster ride of emotions, action, and stakes unlike any other superhero film. The storytelling is ambitious, weaving together multiple narratives and characters seamlessly. The visual effects are stunning, bringing to life a vast array of worlds and creatures.

The film strikes a perfect balance between humor and gravity, showcasing the personalities and dynamics of its extensive cast without losing sight of the high stakes at hand. Thanos, the antagonist, is portrayed with depth and complexity, making him one of the most compelling villains in the MCU.

What sets ""Infinity War"" apart is its ability to keep audiences on the edge of their seats throughout. It's a thrilling, emotional journey that leaves viewers eagerly anticipating the next chapter. Whether you're a dedicated fan or a newcomer to the Marvel universe, this film delivers an unforgettable experience.",10
One of my top 3 favorite MCU movies,1 May 2022,"This should NOT have worked as well as it did. So many characters into only 2 and a half hours... and it knocks it out of the park. The acting, the story and the effects were amazing. Thanos is the best villain.

I will never forget the reaction i had to the ending in the theatre. I didn't expect them to go that route.

I personally think this movie is better than endgame. It holds up to rewatches better than its sequel.

Overall, a landmark achievement in the film world.",10
One decade of build up,10 November 2021,"This is the movie! A decade of build up for this, and it was really good! The movie is just 2. Hours and 30. Minutes of pure action, people that were fans, were not fans or think they are fans watched this movie around the whole world, their are groups of characters that fight for the same thing and as the movie goes on, more and more characters group together until there is only pretty much 1 big group of heroes. This movie is unique because the heroes aren't the protagonist, it's kinda the amazing villain Thanos, he is emotionally driven and his story is great, he is kinda a hero, he thinks wiping out half the universe is necessary to safe the universe from problems caused by overpopulation, he knows it is crazy and solving a problem means trying not to hurt anyone but he believes he has to do it! He is constantly getting hammered by the heroes and you kinda feel bad for him, there is no villain. This is why he is a great villain, he is not trying to be a menace out to blow the world, he is trying to do his part and save it.

Another thing I love is that anyone can watch it, anyone can enjoy it even do they don't care about marvel, the MCU works in a way that someone only has to watch some movies to understand that there is a connection with these stones, and someone going after all of them is a big deal! The movie is it's own think and is pure fun superhero action, it is great and truly has a infinite amount of fun.

The movie is a must watch and is the big event in a way, it is kinda the first part and the second being Avengers Endgame, both movies are their one story at the same time as being a part of this now over a decade long franchise. This is basically perfect and even do it might not be for everyone, this is just amazing!",9
Works better than it has any right to do,27 August 2018,"I bought the hype a bit for this one, which is unlike me, but it did seem like an 'event' that this would be part of the end game for a series of films that have dominated the landscape for about a decade. Of course, it doesn't get to that point by doing much you don't know it will do, and as such there is plenty of action, special effects, witty dialogue, and big moments. So, in some ways it is the same as what these films have always done, but then again it deserves praise for not being what it could easily have been - a bloated failure of excess.

Instead it is surprisingly light on its feet for a film that has so many characters in so many constant action sequences, that carries a lot of supposed darkness but yet has to do it with humor and entertainment value throughout. I know it is a mass produced product, but there is still plenty to admire in the construction of it. As a narrative it has a lot to offer, but the demands on it are too great to allow it to bring out what it could have been. The darkness of it is the best thing about it. Thanos is conflicted in a satisfying way, and the film is never better than when we get to see this - although that is not often enough. The other darkness is the loss of major characters, which is impacting in the moment, but is undercut by the knowledge that all or most of them will be recovered - not least hinted by the many character-specific sequels lined up in years to come. I still enjoyed the darkness these brought, but enjoyed it with the knowledge that it was probably all for show.

The film runs long and probably has too much consistent action for any of it to really raise pulses, but it does the job for a blockbuster - with the characters, darkness, and humor all covering it pretty well. It is far from the brilliant film that some will tell you, and too much of it does feel superficial (which of course it is), but it works much better than it really has any right to do.",
Characters Behaved Irrationally,5 March 2019,,7
The fairly other super hero movie,5 December 2021,"Being called ""Infinity War: Part 1"" at the announcement, Infinity War turned out to be the darker part of an epic final Avengers duology. The emphasis is different to previous films, making Thanos the main character of this darker movie. The cast is excellent as always and really nails the drastically changing emotions in this film. Overall, people can say that this movie is better than Endgame. For my part, I think the double-header of Infinity War and Endgame makes it fantastic, surprising and inspiring story.",9
Everything seemed deliberate...,24 June 2018,,6
A disappointment for a casual fan,2 May 2018,"Every once in a while you walk out of the theatres after seeing the New Big Thing and disappointingly conclude: ""This wasn't made for me"". Which is fine. I don't follow the hype, I don't watch the trailers and don't bother keeping up much with continuity. I generally watch these movies and my reactions tend to fall somewhere in between ""technically competent but flawed"" (e.g. Doctor Strange) to the rarer ""pretty damn good"" (e.g. Black Panther). Because technical competency is never lacking - the writing is generally sharp, casting and acting as well.

Infinity War is technically competent. From what I gather from the more avid watchers of these movies, continuity and fan-service is on top. It's really quite funny - I especially enjoy the Guardians team. But I don't think it's particularly fun, especially not after the first third. The pacing gets bogged down majorly in the second act and you can feel the plot structure bursting at the seems as it tries to force a dozen separate stories and half-hearted arcs into something resembling a traditional movie structure. And it still feels like an hour of character development was roughly cut. Somewhere in the middle of the movie two characters bizarrely meet after one has been missing and presumed dead - which is awkward - but the tension between them is never addressed after this point and I don't even think they share any more dialogue. Here is where the weaknesses in directing seem to become apparent to the point of harmfulness. The Russos directed the last two Captain America movies well enough (the last one being a better Avengers 2 than the actual Avengers 2) but Infinity War seems to be too big of a challenge. Maybe it was too big of a challenge for any director.

A large amount of the focus on character-driven story-telling has fallen to Thanos, who until now has only appeared at the margins of the rest of the universe. And it kind of works. Many directors seem to struggle with relatable antagonists with clear and understandable motivations. That's what makes Killmonger so great. He's frightening because he just may be right. And the angle of antagonist-who-sees-himself-as-hero almost works in Infinity War. Except Thanos' motivations are so ridiculously - and I try to avoid using this word in general - stupid that I couldn't possibly take them seriously. Admittedly, a lot of people can and I'm not going to judge anyone for that. But Thor could have handed Thanos a book on basic political theory and obliterated his entire worldview.

Half the audience was in loud glee and half was in loud anger when the credits rolled. And I have to say I was in the latter camp. But I'm not sure it's fair to get as angry as I initially was. Maybe I'll warm up to it on a second watching. For now, I feel cheated. If the movie was called ""Avengers: Infinity War - Part One"" I probably wouldn't have minded. Or if I kept up with the hype. Which brings me back to my original point. This movie wasn't made for me. I expected it to be something else. Most of the time I just wished the Black Panther universe had more to do with it. Or I just want another Black Panther movie. Infinity War has me exhausted on Marvel. It isn't bad or offensive or really any other strong adjective. It's just bland, poorly structured and disappointing.",5

My Favorite MCU Movie,8 November 2021,"I adore this movie, and it is by far my favorite MCU movie. Each character gets at least one great moment or memorable line, they perfectly mesh all of the different tones established in the respective universes, and Thanos is an iconic villain that was truly given the respect he deserved. This movie has quite a bit of humor, but pretty much all of it worked very well to me. Normally when a marvel movie gets this long, it starts to get boring or it heavily drags during some points, but this movie is constantly moving towards the climax and really keeps you invested. I was so surprised by this, as I saw it with all of my high school buddies without many expectations of it. While Endgame will be remembered as the iconic end of the franchise, this will always be my favorite because of the attention given to each of its characters, and the excellent ending that subverts expectations and perfectly sets up our characters for the finale they needed.",10
The Best MCU Film To Date,15 March 2022,"This film is phenomenal. I have no other way of putting it, they do a amazing job especially with how big this film is. The Russo brothers do a crazy good job with managing this huge cast. Every character is given some sort of purpose and their time to shine and it makes for through the roof entertainment but also a well written movie.

This film has a really big advantage over other MCU films, all of the characters except for one have been developed. It allows the movie to focus far more on the plot and making a quality story and less so on showing who these characters are. This movie is very fast paced, which creates what is the most entertaining MCU film.

The one character that was developed was Thanos played by Josh Brolin. He is the best MCU villain because he was developed. Almost all of the MCU films have one issue and that is the villain. Most MCU villains are not given enough development to be considered a good villain. Thanos is the polar opposite. This film does an amazing job of explaining his character and explaining his motive. There are a few times where you actually ponder whether he is right and that shows how well written Thanos is.

The action in this film is insanely well managed. You get to see each character have their action moment and makes for a really entertaining watch. The comedy was also very good and I feel they managed it a lot better than other MCU instalments. I find a lot of MCU projects use comedy at inappropriate times whereas this film did not.

In terms of gripes there were a lot of plot holes, which is hard to fault them on because of how much they already have to deal with but plot holes are there and they need to be mentioned.

Overall this film is amazing. The Russos do an insane job with managing this giant cast while providing the best MCU villain to date.

9.5/10.",9
Best Film,17 February 2021,"This film is one of the final chapters of the Marvel superhero story that started 10 years ago.

Awful,29 August 2018,"This movie was an overrated summer blockbuster. There was no substance what so ever.

This was supposed to be the climactic end of the saga but instead I'm typical marvel fashion they end on a cliff hanger.

"It's for the fans, not me",29 June 2020,"I understand why Marvel fans like this movie, but I wasn't impressed.

From first scene to last it is just bang, bang, crash, smash, bang! The story is very weak and there is zero character development. Maybe the characters were already fully developed over the previous 30+ movies and hence why so little attention given here.

I'm just not invested in the series and so don't find the Avengers movies to be much of a pay off, but get why others do. Personally, I found it to be an exhausting, unrewarding experience.

I still gave it 7/10 for its appeal to the fans, but possibly 5 or 6/10 for myself.

Best Marvel movie.,19 January 2022,,10
Near-flawless action/space epic,25 April 2018,"SPOILER: 'Avengers: Infinity War' is the third Avengers film and the 19th Marvel Cinematic Universe film overall, serving as a culmination of the last 10 years. Will not a full-stop (Avengers 4 comes out next year), it does a great job of bringing the much-teased infinity stones/Thanos storyline together. Lots of knowledge of the previous MCU films is assumed, especially the two most recent films which lead directly in to this film - 'Thor: Ragnarok' and 'Black Panther'. It might make some sense if you haven't seen the others, but probably not too much.

The stakes are certainly high, with a number of deaths of key characters throughout (no spoilers) and the opening scene literally taking no prisoners. The vital part of this film is the villain, Thanos (Brolin) who - despite being large, ugly & purple - gets enough backstory and shows adequate ethos to almost empathise with his reasoning for wanting to destroy half the universe (via the infinity stones). While there's some deaths and plenty of tension/darkness in parts, there's still lots of laughs, mostly thanks to Thor (Hemsworth), Starlord (Pratt), Rocket (Cooper) and Drax (Bautista).

The CGI is fantastic the entire film, with plenty of scenes in space and on new planets, which is always great to see - as is Iron Man (Downey Jr.)'s inevitable new suit. The way the team-ups are handled is done really well, with Dr Strange (Cumberbatch), the Guardians of the Galaxy, Spider-Man (Holland), Black Panther (Boseman) and the Avengers all split up, so there's always different scenes moving things along at a good pace. The third act battle is not predictable and the ending is hugely shocking - certainly no cop-out.",9

"Detailed storytelling, well realised characters and a compelling villain.",3 May 2018,"I was there ten years ago when Iron Man graced our screens. I was too ignorant to see the movie in the cinema but I was there the second the film came out on DVD. One of my all time favourite cinematic memories was seeing The Avengers in 2012 with all of my friends, after Iron Man came out we saw every film leading up to the Avengers in the cinema and stuck around for each post credit scene. Here I am six years after The Avengers, Infinity War tickets go on sale and I buy two for the BFI IMAX in Waterloo for me and my girlfriend. I walked into this movie with nothing but high expectations and they were all met. This film benefits from the existence of the other 18 films in this illustrious franchise. It builds upon every single character thread and arc laid down in previous films. No theme is left untouched and no character is left without their traits and quirks. Time has left it's toll on some and has barely graced others. Iron Man's unwillingness to let go of the life he stepped into 10 years ago shows in his absolute eagerness to step into battle with his new nano-suit. Captain America's optimism has wavered but his ability to fight for what is right hasn't. The romance between Wanda and Vision doesn't feel random or forced because their connection has been present since Age of Ultron and especially Civil War.

This film continues a theme long explored in the MCU, familial issues. First explored by Stark's complex relationship with his Father which culminated in 2016's Civil War this film widely explores the relationship between Gamora and Thanos. And what a relationship it is. Thanos is terrifying but the love and compassion he feels for Gamora makes him even more terrifying.

This movie does what no other superhero film is doing right now, it uses it's original score (sorry Guardians) to the best of it's ability wherever possible.

I would highly recommend seeing this film as it is amazing, it's characters well realised and is a creative masterpiece.",8
Goes down (too) easy.,29 April 2018,"High on battle scenes and low on actual substance, ""Infinity War"" is the culmination of ten years' hype. And that kind of buildup is embodied in the CGI; this is a visual feast (or marvel, if you will). I mean, this thing bursts with color.

But it's also fairly empty. I mean, hey, that's a *lot* of characters to stuff into a movie, but it feels like one huge chessboard, whisking away certain faces to accommodate others. In that sense, this Marvel galaxy is fractured, and the movie feels choked with characters as a result.

If I have a problem with this movie, it's this: the stakes are never real. Size notwithstanding, Thanos is especially weak here (given his buildup in the Guardians movies), and I didn't walk away thinking that (most) of the deaths are permanent. It's almost antiseptic in that regard; c'mon, they just fade away? Everyone's comparing this to ""The Empire Strikes Back"", but that's only because it's a downer. And only mildly.

I don't mean to harp on the movie. It lives up to the demands of orchestrating a boatload of properties while delivering the high production values. And it's a solid Summertime distraction. And that's about it.

Very disappointing,6 May 2018,,3
Don't believe sad DC fanboys bad reviews.,15 May 2018,"There is literally no way to dislike this movie. People complain about humor. Use your brains and you will see that the humor is necessary yet high quality. There are no mistakes in any of the aspects of the movie. Some minor plot holes but thats it. it's a solid 9.5 movie. An epic journey. With more than 20+ characters Russo brothers managed to an amazing movie with that many caharacters. This is literrally the hardest movie ever in cinema history. And they succeeded amazingly. Which Zack Snyder/DC couldnt do with that terrible movie Batman V Superman. Only 2 or 3 main characters. Pathetic. Stop giving bad reviews because of humor you cant understand. infinity War is a masterpiece.

Acting = Perfect 10/10 Soundtrack = Perfect 10/10 Cgi/Visuals = Perfect 10/10 (Thanos' Cgi is unique, There is no other cgi as good as it) Story = Almost perfect 9.8/10",10

Crowded and a little overrated,3 May 2018,"This was the movie we were expecting for a long long time and while Thanos is the best Marvel villain i got a feeling the movie was a little crowded with all the main characters. Sure, they do need to include everyone but on the other hand we never see them all together and the movies gives a vibe of being rushed around from one place to the other and you constantly need to be focused on what is going on. I love all the characters and actors are amazing performers and the story has got to be dark i do think it was a bit too dark since it does not have one positive moment and the Avengers team gets defeated on and on. Of course there is a sequel coming out but i do think a few positive moments would have been good. I loved all the performances and cgi is amazing so overall a positive experience.",7
5 STAR,1 May 2018,Best marvel movie yet it is one of the most amazing movies I have ever seen,10
Expectations were met.,4 May 2018,"Infinity War is a astonishing film which serves as the culmination of everything that occurred in MCU since the first pictures. Would seem, the movie had to turn out obscure and overloaded, but screenwriters so skillfully bring one moment to another that the movie bewitches with the first until the last minute. ""War"" connects those who didn't know about existence of each other, divides the teams which developed in the past, transfers characters from one region of the Galaxy in another, accompanying everything with grandiose battles. At the same time the narration remains clear and fascinating. Of course, if you've watched the previous movies. It's not a movie for those who want to get acquainted with Captain America, Thor, Hulk and other famous characters. The film is shot for fans, and the better you know the MCU story, the you derive bigger pleasure from viewing.",7
I don't understand all the praise,30 April 2018,"I'm not a huge fan of the superhero genre, but I'm able to appreciate these movies and have a good time when I watch them, however I can't say the same for Infinity War.

Overall it was just a huge mess. A basic cliché formula which consisted entirely of several over-the-top action sequences with snarky one-liners from the ""characters"" every now and then. The plot barely made any sense, in fact most of the time I barely knew what was going on and the villain's motives were unoriginal and cliché

There was apparently supposed to be a lot of emotional weight to this film but it just wasn't there for me. The balance between all the humor and high stakes was just completely off so I didn't know which scenes to take seriously or not.

I think the weirdest part of this movie for me was that the Avengers felt oddly out of place for most of it. The Guardians Of The Galaxy are featured far more prominently so the rest of the characters just feel like random background soldiers who show up every few minutes to kick some ass.",4

"Good movie, but not that great to be on the list of IMDB 250",18 August 2018,"Greetings from Lithuania.

""Avengers: Infinity War"" (2018) was a pretty fun and good movie overall. The ending kinda saved it for me to be a 7/10, ending was good and that is why i'm giving this movie 8/10. But i do not believe that it will end eventually the way it ended in this movie, common - there a more bucks needs to made from this universe. That said, i do not understand what is this movie making on the IMDB 250 list (currently at 30th position) - its definitely not that great. You can trow a rock at me if this movie is better then ""Terminator 2"" or ""Apocalypse Now"" - this only shows how many fans this movie and franchise has - not the quality of this product itself.

Overall, ""Infinity War"" was a good 2 h 20 min escapism, but it suffers pacing issues here and there. At the end i liked this picture and will check the 2nd part as well.",8
Competent directing style creates a strong balancing act that pays off well,10 June 2018,"I know I'm extremely late to the party, but I waited for a time to sync up and see it with a friend (we both have too many obligations in the education realm), plus I had to see Doctor Strange and Thor: Ragnarok beforehand.

Now before I leave any impressions, know that my experience was dampened by students with a moronic goal of sabotage by deciding to blurt out anything about the film they knew that I wouldn't want to know. I mean... what can I do to them in retaliation? Fail them? Strike them down with the hammer of Thor? Nothing, they're untouchable and they know it. It's sad, and I thought I've taught them to be better than that. Unfortunately, that select few is out there and always will be. I've waited nearly thirty years of my life for a film of this impactful magnitude to come out in its respectful genre, and individuals half of my age decide to play the card of indecency upon me and essentially impede on the level of my viewing experience.

All that being said... it was a very good film, even better than I liked it (the problem was the spoilers). In fact, if I were to list negatives for this film, it would really just be all in one lump-sum bullet point regarding the lack of grounded material: a lot of space related stuff, nanotechnology (and I really don't like the Iron Spider compared to regular ol' Spider-Man), whims of inexplicable magic sources, levels of seemingly unbeatable friends and foes where I don't understand the devastation of a punch or explosion onto the individual taking the blow, and the recurring MCU element of death not necessarily being a finality for characters' ends.

Conversely, there were many things that I really appreciated about the film. The first thing I would like to mention was the balance of everything, starting with the balance of characters and their moments. I thought this was going to be a massive issue going into this film, where it would just be one endless action battle and people wouldn't be able to serve their parts correctly, or they would only serve aspects as a moment of convenience to further the plot. Instead, where everyone was at during any moment seemed very natural to the overall MCU progression of items, and interactions that were had (on top of some that have yet to occur, lying in wait for the fourth Avengers film) were nicely played out. Villain encounters even appeared late in the film, which is kind of nice so that the legend looms larger as the movie goes on instead of playing beats such as: ""We need three fights between hero and villain, so let's spread them out."" Even characters who are physically inferior weren't just suitably matched up with other characters of that nature, and instead they found a way to possibly hold their own or team up to make things equal enough so that the fights could be anywhere with anyone. None of this works just in script alone; this was done by the hands of great directing. The Russo Bros have found a way to serve this great kind of balance for two straight films, though in Civil War it really felt a little more like: ""Let's force the issue and get everyone on screen at once, even in a bit of a friendlier brawl."" Admittedly some characters miss the boat of even appearing in the film, but it was few and far between, and they are explained away where frankly it worked just fine.

Another great form of balance was in the light versus dark emotional moments. I have been on Marvel for having too many lighthearted moments in their films, or really too much levity for the sake of entertaining the crowd on their first viewing of a film. They really pushed the envelope with Thor: Ragnarok, and honestly I was not appreciative of it. They needed to find a way to strike the right balance of when to say what and what surface level of comedy they need to inject during the characters given the moments, but most importantly every light moment needs to be balanced with a dark moment for emotions to hit the right heartstrings. Infinity War does exactly that. I wasn't eye-rolling when they injected humor, and only one or two comedic bits were out of place for the moment they were in. That is a fair price to pay for the overall structure. They had enough characters to find those moments with in the 160-minute running time, and for once they didn't have the villain(s) either be demoted to that same level of yuck-yucks nor did they subject them to another character's comedic relief as a way to actually victimize them.

This is a great time to transition to this film's villain: Thanos. I have had my quips with MCU villains being rather underserved in scope compared to that of the larger picture at play, like where they may be more of a pawn so the rest of the chessboard could do its thing. Thanos, however, appears as the king of this universe's chessboard. He was the main character in this film, and probably had the most screen time. He was not just a villain seeking ultimate domination of everything for the sake of it, he has his own goals and purposes in an attempt to restore a harmonious balance (there is that world again) for all species. It was not only believable, but it was also sympathetic. He shows remorse for his (attempted) actions, he shows mercy to those who beg for it so long as they aid in furthering his cause, and he speaks with a level head in a way that if we haven't already had eighteen other MCU films liking our heroes so much that we would actually root for the bad guy here. Definitely the best served comic book villain in a decade, if not right alongside the Joker for 'overall' status. Granted, Heath Ledger has given us the performance of a lifetime, though that character is very one-dimensional (and really good at that dimension, no doubt). Thanos really surprised me that he was more than just a large purple alien wanting ""MOAR.""

I want to give the directors credit for making an extremely long running time feel extremely short. I don't know if I'm sitting here saying that I'd like to watch a whole 'nother hour of the film, but they hit the right beats and paced it so evenly that they really made time fly by in a manner that other films really can't speak for in the same vein. For all the movies I own on Blu-ray, I sometimes stop short of watching something that runs this long because I tell myself: ""This is a long film man, you are going to be devoting a lot of time to this."" I don't think I'll be saying that about Infinity War. If I were to show this to a friend who hadn't seen it yet, I wouldn't be warning them about the duration of it nor would I fear they would be looking at their watch every fifteen minutes wondering when it would end. The more you get into the film, the more you lean forward on the edge of your seat. Yes, sometimes they do cut away from characters to get to others because they have to, but you never forget your place where others are at and you aren't dismayed at the next grouping's story line. It all worked so very, very well.

I'll cap this off with one thing that wasn't as strong as I hoped it would be, and it was in the movie's action. There was nothing wrong with it, but outside of some last-act battles I wasn't ever really wowed by anything either. All visual effects were top-notch, though (ehem, Ragarok was not good here too). I do think I'm putting this on a relative scale though, because it's interesting that I say that looking back at the whole picture that I think the moments outside of the action were actually better than the action points themselves, not in terms of entertainment but just in overall value. That's a good thing too, so now you're not just sitting around waiting to be getting your money's worth again. This jumps back to how the film's length is not a concern. No action scene overstays its welcome either, or it has enough dynamic elements and cross-cutting that it fits properly (again, jumping back to Civil War, that airport scene was just way too contrived... this doesn't have that). Age of Ultron was much more of a popcorn flick for me that I really do enjoy, and The Avengers has all of its lasting appeal in the final third of the film when they all assemble together, so I think I can say this one is the most consistently put together.

Overall, I would say that my experience was definitely a great one and it is likely hitting inside my Top 3 of all the MCU films (The Winter Soldier still wins). I'm not ready to officially rank it just yet and I still have a lot of questions about what I saw in this one, but again that's a good thing about this film's natural depth where I'll have to watch it more than once to understand and appreciate those items. I really think the thing that brings this movie down a notch was my experience because of spoilers beforehand, and I didn't want to believe many of them to be true but unfortunately many were. This is a movie that I even avoided watching trailers for. Any knowledge about an event I am already interested in does not help ramp up the hype by me learning more about it. Shame on them for doing that to my theatrical viewing, but thankfully this film did not only rely on its spoiler-bound moments to be as good as it was. It was very ambitious, and I can't wait to see what they come up with next because I really have no idea where they want to go from here.",8
Marvel scores again,26 August 2018,"Epic superhero team-up from Marvel Studios and directors Anthony & Joe Russo. When an alien named Thanos (motion capture and voice performance from Josh Brolin) begins to collect all six of the Infinity Stones, incredibly powerful artifacts that grant their possessor unimaginable abilities, it's up to the galaxy's greatest heroes to try and stop him. Original Avengers Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Captain America (Chris Evans) join forces with newcomers Dr. Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), Spider-Man (Tom Holland), Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) and even the Guardians of the Galaxy, among others, but will their combined might be enough to stop Thanos' apocalyptic plan?

The culmination of plotlines 10 years in the making, this is one of the biggest gambles in movie history, and it seems to have paid off. The directors and screenwriters somehow manage to juggle this many characters and keep the balance just about right, with memorable moments doled out to all of them. The plot itself is very basic (""Stop Thanos""), and much time is spent on well-executed action scenes and eye-candy science fiction set-pieces. The dialogue is very humorous, and the various character combinations are amusing. There are usually three or four story directions going on at once, with the action switching from location to location frequently, but never in such a way as to become a distraction or disorienting. The biggest question mark of the film was how well Thanos would turn out, a villain that's been teased for the last 6 years in these movies. I was dubious about Brolin's casting, as while I like him in many things, he never struck me as intergalactic demi-god alien appropriate. I'm happy to say that he works out fine, and while the effects work done on him is very good, his voice sells the character, arguably one of the best developed out of any of the Marvel movies thus far.

I won't go into spoiler territory, but I will mention that the ending may befuddle or even anger some viewers. As a former comic book reader, I wasn't upset by it, and even expected it (even before the internet spoiled things for me). But those going in blind should be prepared for an unconventional finale.",8

This movie has everything,1 May 2018,"I am a big Marvel fan and I've been waiting 3 years for it. Once the movie began I didn't want the end. It has everything- action, romantic scenes, sad and happy scenes, scenes, where you want to cry out loud, but also- it is funny sometimes. The main villain Thanos is not just some kind of villain- he explains why he do what he do and it is quite interesting and soon it will be reality, I think. I went to see this movie twice, because there's so much things happening at once, that I just needed to see it again. I don't regret it. It is so heartbreaking, mind blowing and you will want to see the Avengers 4 right now. I don't know, what to do the whole year. And worse- what am I gonna do after Avengers 4? I can say, that it was the best movie I have ever seen. Thank you Marvel for those happy moments in my life. Can't wait till' next year!",10

Arbitrary and capricious + plot holes,3 August 2018,"There is a giant plot hole in the first 5 minutes. Apparently there was a boarding party and the Hulk character was hiding and sneaking up on the enemy. That is very out of character. Normally the Hulk attacks first, directly, and loudly. That part didn't make any sense. Then the Hulk lost in a simple fist fight, when that character has been through much greater ordeals. Then the Asgard transporter is activated when the machine was already destroyed! Such sudden and severe plot holes really made me p-----... made me angry and I vowed to rate 1 star. That was only the first 5 minutes. How they decide who wins against whom is so arbitrary and capricious, and never follows any sort of logic or consistency. I am willing to suspend disbelief, but the writing must follow its own rules! Characters can be smashed by giant boulders, their skin never tears like its made of diamond, yet they bleed from a fist. Pure nonsense. It never occurs to Dr. Strange to use a portal to get back home, when that is half of what he does. Lazy writing. The rest of the movie was entertaining though, with even more plot holes, so I settled on 6.",6

"worth the hype, a brilliant film",25 April 2018,"Infinity War was brilliant, and don't worry even though it has more than 50 characters they all get their moments it was so much fun watching them fight all together

and even though the title says Avengers, it's clearly a THANOS movie, and probably the best character in this film and has the most screen time, and Josh Brolin did an amazing job on portraying Thanos.

The character development is great, except for the children of Thanos which disappoint me a little bit cause they didnt have that much development and screentime but that was expected since there's a lot of characters in this film.

CGI was great! it almost feel like it was real.

there are some scenes that feels like there's too much going on, and like moving to different scenes or places but overall the action sequences were amazing and even the movie is just 2 and half hours, it didnt feel like it was.

the movie is just so brilliant and emotional, 10 years of hard work. it paid off. the ending was definitely shocking, it'll leave you speechless

The character is brought to life by a real actor, and if the acting is flat, so is the character, regardless of how good the CGI is. Josh Brolin deserved at least a nomination, if not the statue itself. This movie was about Thanos, and Brolin brought the character to life, showing that he was a man, but had a vision that would not be denied. The CGI was just adequate to keep up; it was the actor that made the character real. I was almost rooting for Thanos by the end. Almost.

A long ways from the perfect scores people are giving this movie.,21 March 2019,"The only reason I'm giving this movie a 6 and not a 3 is because of its daring script, which I might add, is WAY too heavy for children under 9. I feel sorry for parents who felt obligated to take their kids to this, because it is challenging and depressing, even for adults. There's also a fair amount of in-your-face murder, and allusions to genocide. There's so little happiness in this movie, I give the producers some points for getting it through the studio.

I won't go into long machinations about the plot and characters. All of the characters are there, as far as I can tell, and it does get crowded. It's impossible to tell who has what powers at some points, since several seem omnipotent, with all manner of energy weapons. The problem with energy weapons as a plot vehicle, is that why do they even bother with learning combat? Why is an energy hammer more powerful than an energy spear? Why send packs of feral dog monsters if they can just be slaughtered? Can every single superhero breathe in space? Even Spiderman? He is aware that gravity is much reduced to swing on his webbing, right? Why does noone's hair or makeup get mussed after brutal combat, except on occasion, certain heros do get injured, stabbed, have their skin broken etc. There's absolutely no rhyme or reason to any of this, and it gets old.

A few characters have mind-controlling powers as well, and that gets really hard to track. Some have novelty powers that seem as directed by the special effects department as anywhere else. The battles are relentless, and frequently devoid of all manner of scientific logic. If you can't stand watching modern video games, you don't want to see this movie, because it behaves much like one.

The villain Thanos is definitely sinister, in voice and deed more than in looks, since he is a 3D construct, and I found it harder to take him seriously than the other live actors in the film. I still have no idea what Scarlet Johansson does, short of look good. She can fly around and kick things. THat's pretty useless to the other heros and villains throwing around energy bolts and space/time warping spells and weapons. For some reason, Thor has some of the most fearsome power, when he finally pulls it together in a method that is reminiscent of getting a lawn mower started, another thing which made absolutely zero sense.

At times, the movie definitely feels made up as you go along, although there was a clearly defined plot that was crafted as a devilish and depressing cliffhanger, so that's the most redeeming feature. There is a good parable about sacrificing what is most important to us for ultimate power, and it is well delivered, so that's the main thing holding up this otherwise hollow picture.

Big props to Zoe Saldana, for grounding and exploring the character Gamora, and bringing the best acting to a picture that doesn't leave much time for any of its big stars to do much but show up, make unfunny quips and fight. The writers were smart to give her as much dialogue as she had. Without the dynamic between her and Thanos, this picture would be nothing.

I am curious to see how this predicament is addressed in the next film, since the evil fell across this movie and also Ant Man and the Wasp, but I fear that the payoff will be one drawn-out slugfest and energy weapon fest, and that, like Revenge of the Jedi, it cannot be as good as the depressing Infinity War/Empire Strikes Back tragedy flick template. This was no Empire Strikes Back however. Let's be real on that one.

Let me add I'm being generous, because I'm an adult who can hack some of these comic strip films, especially the better ones like Wonder Woman. However, if you find the cliches rife in these movies intolerable, definitely stay away from this movie, because it is knee deep in many of the problems of this genre. And Tony Stark should be chasing Scarlett, NOT Pepper Pots.",6

It was OK...,6 May 2018,"'Infinity War' is overrated. It's entertaining, but I was expecting more. I can't even believe it's somewhere at the top of the best 250 movies list. The direction was OK, definitely not as good as some say, but the storyline was a bit of a mess. Each character was in a different planet fighting for different stuff. I think it was too risky wanting to put together so many superheroes in one movie. We didn't even get to see Captain America or Black Widow for more than 15-20 minutes, in a 2h30m long movie. I was also hoping for a more epic final battle, like in the first Avengers movie. This one was too short and messy. Maybe we'll get to see a better one in the next film.

10/10 Awesome epic adventure from start to finish..!,29 April 2018,"10/10 and this is why..! I've watched this film three times now so I can get a true picture of it and honestly I enjoyed it more, the more I watched it. To juggle a huge cast this size and make it work is an accomplishment, and boy is this an accomplishment.

Each character shines in their own way and the comedy is placed well, so not to take away the depth, the pain, the suffering and severity off this story arc. The SFX is some of the best ever seen in my opinion, yes there are some slight flaws here and there, but not enough to take your mind of the story on screen. Thanos looks amazing and for the true comic fans like myself Kevin Feige, the Russo brothers and the team at Marvel Studios have excelled in bringing the dark Titan from page to screen.

Josh Brolin is totally worthy of playing this nemesis and Brolin adds heart, pain, power and a sadness to this character, as always the Marvel team hits a home run with the casting. Every little detail is put into Thanos. For a purple giant he looks realistic, from an eyebrow movement or a cheek twitch to a full on capable gladiator in battle stance, he looks like a living, breathing being.

Where does this film stand against the rest of the MCU, well it's right up there in the top three. Some people might not like or even fully understand the ending, but the possibilities it sets up for the future of the MCU only leaves me with questions and excitement! This film has made some choices that surprised me as a comic collector and fan of 33 years, but I honestly thank them for that, the Russo brothers not only promised, but also delivered the film we've been awaiting.",10

A best,30 September 2021,THIS IS THE BEST MARVEL MOVIE AND ALL TIME BEST MOVIE.... ACTION.... ACTION.....ACTION.,10
I don't understand what all the fuss is about this one.,27 May 2018,"This was a half-decent movie. I really like the parts that have Dr. Strange in them. If there is one criticism of this movie, it is that of the decisions of the heroes and the mistakes they make during the course of the plot. It's like they're all suffering from Bipolar and can't compose themselves or take themselves seriously enough to get a grip! I mean after all, the fate of the entire UNIVERSE is at stake!!!! Yes that is literally the plot line. I will now have to do some research because I am not a comic book guy, so this peeked my interest.",7
A piece of pure crap.,8 June 2018,"This movie is a piece of crap, just like every other marvel movie of 2017-2018. The storyline is bad, the acting sucks, the jokes are stupid. Thanos is the worst villian ever; his acting and personality in the film is pathetic. This movie is a waste, not a classic.",3
BEST AVENGERS MOVIE TO DATE!,8 November 2021,"I'm a huge comic movie junkie and I could not wait to see this movie. I always see them on opening day in the theaters no matter what! This one is so action packed with all your favorite avengers. I had every emotion and feeling under the sun while watching this. I got goosebumps, I cried, I laughed, I got excited, I had anxiety, I was nervous, I was angry, I was happy. This movie will definitely give you whiplash in the emotion department. But it is by far the best avenger movie to date! And considering that it's their last one, I'm happy about that. But I'm extremely sad that this is the end of this MCU universe and I will miss all of them so very very much. At least we still have Thor, who should be appearing in the new Guardians of the Galaxy movie.",10
Best film of series,23 June 2020,"Now this was epic... surprising plot twists.... so much build up - epic fight scenes, good humour and great banter. The ultimate penultimate and better the 2nd time around",10
my opinion,30 March 2021,,10
The beginning of the end,1 September 2020,Absolutely brilliant from the MCU once you put everything together. It was initially painful having to wait a year after the end of infinity war but the film was brilliant. All the characters and different elements to the film. I could go on and on but 10/10 says enough.,10
A mega crossover that doesn't disappoint!!,2 September 2020,"Avengers: Infinity War is the one of the 2 best MCU movies besides Endgame. It has beautiful visual effects, outstanding performances, amazing story, fabulous soundtrack, very unexpecting, high stakes, great action sequences, and marvelous chemistry!!! It never slows down, and doubles the hype and stakes as it gets to the end. Thanos is the best MCU villain in the series! Loved the movie so much to Infinity. I've been waiting years for it, and it does not disappoint. Infinity War is a MASTERPIECE.",10
Heartbreakingly Good,29 December 2019,,9
Glad I saw it with MoviePass,7 May 2018,"I'm not a follower of the Avengers movies, and I only went to see this one because I had a MoviePass. Yes, I know the comic book lore of the Avengers team and Thanos and the Soul Gems, it's just that the movie falls under its own weight of too many superheroes with too many subplots. Each character's presence is diluted because of the need to give fair screen time to each. Spider-Man, Bruce Banner, Black Widow, Black Panther, Doctor Strange, each Guardian of the Galaxy. And I don't know if it was just me, but the actors kinda seemed to phone it in for the most part. Of course, this isn't Tolstoy, it's a bunch of people with mutant or augmented superpowers traveling through space-time to stop an intergalactic warlord from retrieving gems that will give him the ability to rebalance the universe. There's a lot of contemporary humor in the movie, namely the millennial snark found in modern sitcoms. I don't get the hype, but I do appreciate that some people will like this. That's the beauty of having individual tastes: someone's pudding is someone else's broccoli. It just wasn't for me, and I don't have an interest in seeing the conclusion of this anthology, even with MoviePass.",6
I'm Emotionally Drained,28 April 2018,"It's been about an hour since I saw this movie and I'm still in shock. This movie was absolutely overwhelming from start to finish, and it really brings a strong emotional aspect that we have never seen from Marvel before. No doubt this is in my top 5 movies of all time, and there is no reason why you should not see this movie. But, before you see it, if you are not familliar with the marvel universe, I recommend doing a little bit of research before going.",10
"I've seen it once, I don't need to see it again.",31 March 2019,"You know when you go on a rollercoaster ride with one of your parents? And, bless them for coming along, but they always complain afterwards that they feel sick, their back hurts and that they're just glad it's finally over? That's the reaction I had to this one folks. With so many name characters having to have a slow pan, tilt up to face reveal shot before doing anything all the way through this film I was getting deja vu about one third of the way through the film, only to find the rest of it had to be so fast paced in order to keep all of those plates spinning at once, that your eyes and brain never get a chance to rest. For most of the movie all that's really happening at any one point is ""Remember these two guys? Let's have them meet for the first time. And now we'll cut to a fight between them and another band of generic villains"". That doesn't make for a bad movie, but that can summarise what happens in this film roughly 4 or 5 different times, and unfortunately the break-neck pacing idea seems to have caught on because after seeing this movie I've noticed almost every other new film I've watched since try to do the same race through their story beats that more often than not leaves me tired. I don't know, I've never been a huge fan of the Marvel Movie Machine, it's definitely had a handful of great films amongst it's wide variety of mostly pretty good ones, but this definitely falls into that second category - worth seeing if you're into these movies, but I'm definitely not going to sit through the whole thing again.",6

8.4 ARE U KIDDING...ATLEAST A 9/10 Star.,22 December 2023,"MY DEAR LORD THIS MOVIE IS INCREDIBLE!

8.4 is good but i think its a little weak.

I mean Thanos is the best villain MCU character there will be!

The movie is freakin hilarious, action packed, and a ride!

Thanos Vs Avengers. Wow wow woah wow!

The battle scenes are fire.

I think this movie needs nothing. I mean it was so good people in theaters were going nuts! And i was one of those nutballs!

I personally think this will be the best MCU movie for a long time. Endgame was incredible too but personally it just wasn't like Infinity War.

If you have seen this film yet. Watch Avengers and Avengers: Age of Ultron ASAP.

You'll watch Infinity War 2-3 times forsure!",10
Our heroes,1 January 2021,"Since 2012 I watched every MCU film in the cinema. It was part of my childhood and I was hyped on every single film when it was announced. So when Infinity War was announced it was something special. The final battle with our heroes against the ultimate villain. And it didn't dissapoint. I absolute loved it and the end shocked me. I went out of the cinema and couldn't believe it. For me it's the peak of the superhero genre alongside with Endgame.

So now were in the Endgame...",10
The best of the MCU,12 July 2022,"This film achieves absolutely everything it aims to. All the heroes show their motivations and interact well with eachother, from where they were all left by individual films. The villain is one of the great movie villains, horribly evil and intimidating but you fully understand his loss and his motivations. Needless to say the CGI and cinematography are flawless as is the script. What a film. It also has one of THE great endings in cinema.",10
Sad but amazing,29 April 2018,,10
Very exciting video,31 August 2021,"I took the family out and We all actually enjoyed Ourselves, and that it the best type of movie experience. I would recommend this film.",9
Superhero odyssey,25 July 2020,"A tape of incomparable magnitudes. An unprecedented superhero odyssey. This seems to me the best way to describe this film, which takes the limits of the genre to a new level. In a world like today where superhero cinema dominates the market, even more so the movies from Marvel Studios, it can often be difficult to surprise. However, Infinity War not only creates this emotion inherent in a movie of these characteristics, but it brings together the best that Marvel has built over ten years and mixes it in an organic as well as frantic and impressive way every second. It is a film that is practically constant action, like many of the genre, but with a speech and an emotional weight greater than that seen on other occasions. A special care is appreciated in forming a convincing story with enough dramatic and sentimental value, at the same time that the narrative action does not stop. 'Avengers Infinity War' is first and foremost a superhero movie that embraces the genre and exploits it to the fullest. A film with great ambitions that is capable of surpassing itself, resulting in one of the best films in the studio and in the genre itself.",10
A lot happening,12 March 2019,"Avengers: Infinity War has become a massive box office success and occasional worldwide phenomenon. Following the success of Age of ultron, it was clear this film was intended to be a massive success and bigger than the previous.

Infinity War is quite good yet somewhat disappointing in the slightest. Difficult on rating since one did enjoy the film but at the same time, it felt somewhat predictable and unengaging.

The film boasts many characters from each of their respective films and jam packs them into one. It is interesting to see everyone else involved in the interactions in which we haven't seen, such as the cast of the Guardians films messing with Thor, Iron Man, and Spider-Man. Overall Infinity War does offer much different occurrences, a lot if characters and a lot going on.

Though one can't help feel that it wasn't as great as advertised. Perhaps a second viewing is needed down the line.",7
The pinnacle of The MCU,3 April 2021,"As epic and satisfying as Endgame was, I think the true peak of the Marvel Cinematic Universe is Infinity War. The brilliant weaving-together of characters from such different corners of the universe into their unique storylines, the incredible examination of Thanos as an actual character in the story, top-tier visuals and action, and a final sequence that is absolutely gut-wrenching and powerful: this film will always stand above the rest for me. The Empire Strikes Back of Marvel films. 10/10.",10
Meh,7 November 2018,"Meh, its alright. The CG is nice The fights are cool The Story is dumb The deaths of no weight Their was no reason to care what happened",7
Not worth my money and time,10 June 2018,This movie made the good cast look stupid and no common sense. Made the bad or evil cast dominating from start to finish. I vote for nonsense movie of the millennium!!!!,1
Love this film,4 September 2021,"I love this film, it has the correct balance of all the ingredients. For the people saying this is better than Endgame, I suppose so, but I look at it as a Kill Bill type situation. They are parts one and two of the same film and as such should be viewed as a whole. Infinity war has so much bang for your buck that Endgame if compared it way flatter, but really they are Cause and effect, setup and resolution.

Brilliant, vibrant, funny, highly entertaining and unpredictable stuff.",10
Incredible,25 April 2018,"Best marvel movie yet, so much action and sadness at the same time. Can't wait for the 4th avengers",10
What did we expect?,25 April 2018,"The hype for Avengers Infinity War was truly real. The expectations were to the roof with this one, but I'm afraid we all did a huge mistake on what to expect. Can a 150 minute movie deliver on the level of these expectations and hype? Well it can't, but this movie does it's best.This film is completely different than any other MCU film, and any other film in general, and you will find that out when you see it for yourself. You must be happy to see your favourite character even for 5 minutes in this movie, that's one of the necessary cons of the mix, and we shouldn't expected more in the first place.The movie lacks basic plot development. That'sFORTUNATELY not a very bad thing in the end of the day. In general, the movie delivers what a 150 minute movie with 20+ main cast can deliver. The consequences were unexpected, and shocking, and the Russo brother did their best. I'm sure if you go to see he movie with low expectations you will enjoy it a hell more. 9.5/10 After rewatching this movie I will change my vote from 8 to 9.5.

*It's impossible for this title to remain at 9.5/10, and do not trust this number. Batman v Superman started at 9.8 as well, and we know where it ended up. Really, I think most of the fans will like it A LOT, but the score will drop A LOT once the movie opens in the US and China. Most of the votes now, come from people who have not even seen the movie yet.",10
One to Watch,25 April 2018,"First off the movie was great from begining to the end . A roller coaster ride of adventure I enjoyed it every minute and went out the theaters wanting to see more. So expect me to go see it again before it end its run.! No super hero movie has ever come close to what people at Marvel are doing at the moment. And Avengers Infinity War said that furthermore this movie soared through my expectations. The visual was spectacular the action was explosive and satisfying. The Russo's have crafted Something truly remarkable and freshness that you'd never expect. The ending of this film truly opens up an intriguing narrative possibilities that strech in any direction. On the strength of this outing, that's Something to be anticipated, rather than feared.

I highly recomend everyone to go see it",10

Fun. But its the same old story!,29 April 2018,"The sequel to 2012's The Avengers and 2015's Avengers: Age of Ultron, and the nineteenth film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), 'Avengers: Infinity War', which assembles almost ALL of its Superheroes in one single film, is the biggest Marvel Blockbuster to date. Although an event for us cinema-lovers & the biggest film of 2018, 'Infinity War', despite being truly fun, is the same old story. There is not much difference between Avengers 1, 2 or Infinity War. Its the done to death Good versus Bad story.

'Avengers: Infinity War' Synopsis: The Avengers and their allies must be willing to sacrifice all in an attempt to defeat the powerful Thanos before his blitz of devastation and ruin puts an end to the universe.

'Avengers: Infinity War', which has taken the biggest box-office weekend globally in history, becoming a milestone at the ticket windows, is truly an event. I, myself watched the film yesterday in an almost packed house, here in Hollywood, Los Angeles. The audience, including me, found ourselves at times clapping & whistling for the superheroes, who at every point, try their best to defeat the menacing Thanos. It was an experience, of course!

But, here's the thing. There is a difference between being excited & enjoying, and there is a difference on what the story is all about. While the stakes are higher here for its multiple heroes against one villain, the baddie here too, like Ultron or Loki, is out for destruction of the world. Or maybe half of it. And that's where 'Infinity War' fails to rise above its mediocrity. I am not expecting a Masterpiece here, but at the end, I feel as I'm watching the same film again & again. And while I WILL NOT give away ANY SPOILERS, all I can say that 'Infinity War' isn't even brave enough to take giant strides in its storytelling. Its the same film, with more action, more heroes & more havoc.

That being said, this isn't a bad film from any angle. 'Infinity War' is a fun watch. The action-sequences are fantastic, the graphics are simply terrific & the humor & banter between its heroes, raises many richly earned laughs. I wasn't bored here, despite its predictable narrative structure. Its an entertainer, for sure!

Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely's Screenplay is a good mix of fun & maddening action, but plays it safe overall, despite raising the stakes. Anthony and Joe Russo's Direction is extravagant. Cinematography is superb, while the Editing could've been a bit tighter. The film is a bit too long at a 149-minutes! Art & Costume Design are perfect. Alan Silvestri's Score is excellent, as always. And the Production Values, are top-notch!

Performance-Wise: Josh Brolin as Thanos & Zoe Saldana as Gamora, shine the brightest. Brolin gives the villain a character beyond the bad, while Saldana adds heart & depth to her part. Of the heroes, Chris Pratt as Peter Quill / Star-Lord, is very entertaining & his comic-timing is spot-on, Chris Hemsworth as Thor, continues to raise laughs & portrays his part heroically, Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark / Iron Man, is good as usual, Benedict Cumberbatch as Dr Strange, is painfully one-note, Chris Evans as Steve Rogers / Captain America, is efficient & Tom Holland as Peter Parker / Spider-Man, is extremely likable. Special Mentions for Dave Bautista as Drax the Destroyer & Peter Dinklage as Eitri, who stand out in their parts.

On the whole, 'Avengers: Infinity War' offers a bang for your buck. But its the same old story, once again.",6

Sure, non-stop action with all your favorite heroes and foes, yet an overly fast paced plot leaves only the outstanding SFX to remember when you feel cheated by the ending, and knowing you have to wait another year to close-out the mystery. So until then, you have to jump to your own conclusions. Not a fan of these type of plots. Still, exciting and well directed and acted. A generous 9/10 from me.",9

No Resurrection this time.,5 May 2018,,8
Cash grab! They are stretching out this story into two parts.,27 April 2018,"The movie had some good character moments but aside from Thanos' story arc, which was interesting, the movie was a convoluted mess. And not even all of the action kept me from yawning. Dr. Strange had some great action scenes but for the most part the choreography in this film was nonexistent and sloppy. And If people thought the humor in the Last Jedi was out of place then you will really be disappointed here. Unlike Thor Ragnorok, the humor in Infinity War was for the most part; not funny and it came up at wrong moments in the film, which removed the seriousness in certain situations.

Even the acting seemed lazy, especially the performances of Ruffalo and Evans. These guys are running out of steam and put no energy into the roles this time. Even Robert Downey and Tom Holland lacked the chemistry they have often displayed in previous films. Perhaps its not their fault but the due to the fact that they had so little screen time. This film might as well be a Guardians of the Galaxy film, but they called it an Avengers film because they have more prestige. The film should have been called Infinity War and that's that.

To sum it up, this film is a 2.5 hour long first act of a three-act film. Save your money because you will be disappointed, just like my entire theater was.",6
The War Is Here!,25 April 2018,"This is...I literally got no words after this movie.

This is the most epic movie you'll ever seen. You will cry from pleasure, you will cry from epicness and you will definitely cry from heartbreaking scenes. Ten years of building, leading to this MASTERPIECE!

I guess you want to know something about Thanos. Well, he is the ultimate villain, I mean he is menacing. Every speech that he got, gives you chills, his movements, his motivation, hands down the best villain!

The interactions between the different fractions of heroes is magnificent. The first time you see Guardians and Thor, Iron Man and Guardians, Strange and Spidey it's just awesome! The chemistry between them is incredible.

The story is told incredibly. The waiting for this movie, the hype, everything is worth it. Actions scenes especially some....are jaw dropping, you gonna shake your head and you will be not able to stay on your seat calm. The music combined with the scenes, like I said MASTERPIECE...this movie is out of this world.

Russo Brothers just strike again! The visuals are so well done too. There is no way to catch every single detail on the first viewing, also the movie deserves multiple viewings again and again and again...and I'm not even joking.

On purpose I do not want to give you absolute any spoilers. I want you to enjoy the movie by yourself. I believe any real fan will be happy with the result of ten years gradation and like me, will got no words.",10

An epic blockbuster that lives up to the hype!,25 April 2018,"Avengers: Infinity War (2018) is an epic blockbuster that scratches that superhero itch you've felt since its trailer. With a cast as big as Thanos and action that blows you back into your seat, it's hard not to re-queue when the film is over. Unlike the destruction caused by Loki in the first film and Ultron in the second, with this film, Thanos brings a whole new definition of threat. The heroes' greatest battle begins here and the special effects, acting, emotion and intertwining story arcs make for an exiting Marvel experience. The humour element was well balanced, unlike the changing trend with some of the latest Marvel instalments, and the chemistry between characters seemed authentic. I do admit, however, that some scenes seemed disjointed and proved to block the flow of the narrative - a minor nit-picking issue. The pacing of the film flowed well and at no point, in the 2.5 hours, did I feel bored. Infinity War is a high-octane, action-fueled, amazing instalment that succeeds in living up to its insane fan hype.

The Internet is a harsh wasteland, and spoilers are out there, tread carefully!!

Avengers...Assemble?,29 April 2018,"""Avengers"": Infinity War"" is an epic unlike any other. It's a reminder of how far the MCU has come in 10 years and this movie capitalises on its bloated, but beloved cast to draw you in. Every character gets their own moment to shine a little, the dizzying, vibrant comic book action is satisfying and defies conventions. While admittedly, this darker chapter in the Marvel movie-verse is oddly paced and suffers from the occasional tonal inconsistency, all issues can easily be forgiven as almost each scene is a sizeable dosage of fan service. Josh Brolin as Thanos deserves all the attention he gets, as he is a villain with a tragic story to tell. For really the first time, the consequences are felt and resonate long after the credits roll. non-stop comic book action and surprising emotional depth. While a little uneven at times, its beloved cast, outstanding villain and sheer scope never underwhelm and the end product is something truly epic.",9

what a lousy movie,31 May 2018,,7
Avengers a flutter,17 May 2018,"Marvels studios Avengers: Infinity War certainly lives up to the hype it generates. Now take a slow peek beneath the 'hype' and what do you find? You will see a repeat of what previous MCU chain movies offered: Slick action and stunning visuals. The producers know this mix works very well at the box office and so it comes to no surprise they apply this same formula again here.

Supposedly the culmination of previous MCU movies, Avengers: Infinity War is where superheroes gather to prevent the main villain Thanos from acquiring a set of supernatural stones in order to become the most powerful being in the entire universe and beyond.

With a disjointed plot, mediocre story line and poor character development for the main villain, Avengers: Infinity War falls below expectation as a standalone movie. The story line totally fails in building up the viewer's eagerness for their superheroes to give Thanos a good thrashing. (The exception maybe fanboy's for Bruce Banner) The supers are made to look as if they are a bumbling bunch, caring more for their kin than saving the entire universe. On the opposing side, Thanos is a grey brooding being waiting a chance to tell his (or it's) dull life story....yawn. Thano's screen presence doesn't invoke anything out of the viewer's emotions. No fear, anger or even sympathy; Nothing!

Towards the end of the movie I thought it would have been just super if Dr. Strange opened up a portal from the 'other' alternate superhero universe for the man of steel to come and beat Thanos out of his boring stone hunting life.

As of previous MCU movies, nutty one liners are a prerequisite and here in one glaring instance the scriptwriters stooped low for this.

Is Avengers: Infinity war a great movie? Opinions differ on opposite ends and with respect to that, let me say that Avengers: Infinity war is not great and not even good a movie.

Parents (If family values are high on your list) with young kids wanting to see this, be aware that Avengers: Infinity War has a dark underlying theme.

2 stars, one for Tom Holland and the other for Tom Vaughan-Lawlor.",2

Marvel has set the bar super high with this movie!,26 April 2018,"I've enjoyed a large chunk of the Marvel Cinematic Universe movies. Not all of them worked for me, but I gotta say Avengers: Infinity War has set the bar really high for Superhero movies. Without spoiling anything (and believe me, this is a movie that works best without spoilers!), all I can say is there is a lot of darker and edgier stuff that will surprise you, as well as the Comedy you expect from a Marvel movie. However, perhaps most surprising was the main villain Thanos (Josh Brolin) having alot of character development in it. He's a bit more complex than your standard Superhero villain, but also very menacing and quite sympathetic too.

I worried about the movie having such a long running time and having to focus on a lot of the characters, but to Marvel's credit, they pulled it off extremely well and the 2 and a half hours running time went pretty quick. The action is what you'd expect from an Avengers movie, it was never boring to me and I found it pretty funny myself. No issues with the CGI and everyone acted decently in it.

The amount of discussions I had with friends and families after coming out of seeing it was insane, as well as the other audiences. Depending on how invested you were into the Marvel characters in previous movies will affect how you feel about it, but I think as a movie that ties and groups a lot of the characters together in one big Blockbuster, Infinity War has exceeded what I can hope for. It had action, emotion, comedy, and is pretty close to a perfect package you could expect from one of these movies. I can't wait to re-watch it and hopefully part 2 will live up to expectations.

"The cumulation of a universe, 10 years in the making",25 April 2018,"Avengers Infinity war was great for me as a fan of both the comics and the MCU ever since its inception. However, i can absolutely see the flip side of this, being a celebration for the past 10 years of the MCU it manages to embody the theme, tone, emotional stakes and attachment established in the past 10 years. Thus, for an audience who has barely seen any of the MCU films they might find it difficult, confusing and even just a storyline mess with no emotional stakes or attachment to the characters that I as a fan embody.

Infinity war embodies all that comes before it and because of that it was able to deliver action, spectacle and a complete combustion of stories that it wouldn't be able to without this rich background and journey that has culminated to this moment.

Despite all this, infinity war does still manage to weave in character arcs and development, characters like iron man, Scarlet witch, Star lord. All got meaningful character building arcs. While many other characters were unfortunately rather lost in the mix. But, these are just minor complaints considering how good of a job the Russos have already done in balancing stories, characters and handling brilliant action scenes. Considering the astronomical task of crafting the film there has to be characters that are more in the background and playing second fiddle, and I think that is perfectly acceptable.

But arguably the films greatest victory is in Thanos, this is very much his story. Not only did we get a pure world conquering, villainous villain but we got to see so many sides to him. We saw brief moments of tenderness, but still see the menacing all conquering 'mad titan' that he is.more importantly, he had a motive that isn't of selfish origins. Thanos actually has a point and that creates an ability for audiences to understand where Thanos is coming from. This is something that marvel has had a huge issue with in the past but with Thanos and even the recent Killmonger perhaps marvel has finally found a way to fix its notorious 'villain problem'.",9

It's all fun and games until you realise you have seen it again,6 May 2018,"Full of CGI, no dialogue, action packed and zero substance. If you still like these kind of things after a tone of other superhero movies, you will probably enjoy it.",5
Avengers: Infinity War,13 August 2020,"Long behold, the film everyone has been waiting ten years for, is finally here! This is one of those Marvel films that anyone can enjoy, while the Russo Brothers also brilliantly utilizes all that we've learned in the past MCU films, to create the most cohesive, emotional, and high octane, story yet! The Russo Brothers utilized some of the best tones the MCU has set, to really enhance the emotion and tention in every scene. They put a great deal of heart into this film, but sometimes it got cut thin by the over abundance of jokes, that Marvel seems to think is necessary, every opportunity there is. The Russo Brothers had both hands on the wheel at all times, setting this fast, yet brisk pace, incorporating countless memorable scenes! There wasn't a scene that goes under appreciated, adding in tremendous risk, from the most menacing villain yet, but at times, it can feel a little clunky with the scene placement.

With this still being a story-based film, the characters moved the story really well, being the driving force of the film! While having all of these characters on screen at once, it's impossible to balance everyone equally, but the Russo Brothers were able to create so many amazing character moments, to get you really invested into what's going on, and not so much, what they missed. Even though they can step on their own toes at times, creating some inconsistencies and plot gaps, they still did a good job of understanding where these characters come from, and used them to their strengths. The cast as a whole does a great job, displaying seamless chemistry, even from some of the side and new characters.

The screenplay by Christopher Markus & Stephen McFeely, was very good overall. There are a lot more high points to the writing than bad, but there are still some forceful pieces of dialogue and jokes at times. Markus and McFeely have had their hands in most of these films, creating some hit or miss screenplays, but they put on their best work here.

So far, Infinity War undoubtedly has the best action sequences of the saga. The Russo Brothers crafted so many high octane action scenes, backed up by some amazing stunt work. The effects were done pretty well for the most part, but there are some points where you can tell they got lazy, and didn't completely polish things up as well as they could've.

Overall, Infinity War is THE BEST film of the Infinity Saga, bringing these films to new heights!",8
The Ultimate Popcorn Movie,4 August 2018,"The best thing I can compare Avengers: Infinity War to is a high speed roller coaster. From the first action sequence to the last the viewer is flung around various battles, universes and emotions. Thanos was much better developed than I expected, and seeing many characters from different films finally interact was rewarding for those who have been watching MCU films since they first came out. While IW was not the best or deepest super hero movie I've seen, it is unlike any other cinematic experience I have ever had. It's easily the closest I've felt to reliving Saturday morning super hero cartoons in theaters, especially with the ""to be continued"" ending. I was expecting pure fun and I got exactly that.

As a standalone movie was a disappointment,28 January 2019,"As a likely minority in the over-rated super-hero extravaganza, Infinity War as a standalone movie was a disappointment. It pandered to the audience with simple script devices where the superheroes were made to look pretty stupid, uncertainly un-Jason Bourne like in mentality and behavior. The evil ones were able to convenient arrive just in time to continue the storyline that could have easily ended multiple number of times at any number of points if these multitude of conglomerate, almost innumerable superheroes could actually learn to work together and obtain the oneness that comes of Buddhist, Eastern cultural wisdom of the importance of society over the individual. The backstory of Thanos and his daughter was too brief and insufficient to provide a more complex and bonded emotional connection is one problem. And another problem is simply too many superheroes that almost makes the movie more about heroes becoming the norm instead of super. It's almost now about many people who appear to be super but the movie is populated with so many of them that really it seems that they are normal people with extraordinary differences that the audience has seen so often that they almost appear normal now, nothing really special anymore, something the audience just comes to expect. Overall, the movie substantively is pretty superficial and the plot while challenging includes too many cliques and uneven tone from a chaotic fusion of trying to be so cute and funny, to serious and emotional riveting so much so that it becomes neither.",7
How can this be so good?,21 June 2018,"Quite honestly this shouldn't work. Marvel has been approaching its breaking point for a while now. By conventional wisdom there are too many characters, too many storylines, too many warring threats and points of interest. We could even kind of see it in The Age of Ultron. Too many plot points, too vast a scale, too far-reaching a scope.

But somehow Marvel broke through. This is an amazing movie. It is everything that was promised and more. A third installment that actually manages to raise the stakes, to deliver something that feels bigger, grander, more epic than anything we've seen before. And keeping in mind that this is Marvel, and that we have seen some truly astonishing things already, that is saying something.

So what exactly did they do to pull this off? Well, for one, they absolutely nailed the villain. Thanos (Josh Brolin) had already been teased multiple times in previous films, but he had always been a big question mark for us. Would he truly be that threatening? Would he actually have the menace, the charisma and the ambition to stand as the biggest threat the Avengers had ever faced? I'm glad to report that he does exactly that, and more. Thanos might very well be the best villain Marvel has ever produced. That is not as high a bar as it perhaps should be, but it's still plenty assuring.

The usual tricks are also in full display and they work marvelously. Beautiful CGI, good character moments, lush backgrounds, fun character interactions and a real sense of adventure. Granted, the storyline is one of the grimmest yet seen in Marvel, but that merely makes it all seem worth more.

Now, to be fair, this is only the first part. The Infinity War will continue in the next Avengers film. But this is one of those rare Part Ones that manages leave you begging for more. That ending... We will be talking about that ending for decades to come.",9
Not as good as it could have been...,8 April 2022,"A good movie overall...but there's a few things that I just can't get over. First, the whole theory that this mighty Titan is going to reek havoc all over the galaxy so he can ""reduce the population by 50%""...really??? All of that effort expended JUST TO DO THAT??? Well, mourn losses and have babies. So stupid it can't be overlooked. Another, Quill is NOT that stupid...to risk (50% of the pop of the galaxy). The action scenes make up for the plot stupidity...but you can't have a great movie with such silly plot holes.",7

Avengers: Infinity War is an excellent culmulation of all the previous movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe,3 May 2018,"If you've read my reviews on this site over the years, you must've known that I love superheros and especially Marvel ones. So when watching this with my movie theatre-working friend, we were very excited to watch all those awesome characters come together to fight one really Big Bad one who cannot be easily defeated by just any one of them, one who goes by the name of Thanos. I mean, at the very beginning, someone is already defeated and by the end, well, it's not pretty, that's for sure! That end also seems to be a cliffhanger for the inevitable sequel that I know has already been made and is due next year. Great mix of humor and drama! I and my friend really enjoyed it so on that note, yes, go watch Avengers: Infinity War if you haven't already!",10

To Infinity,26 April 2018,"This review of Avengers: Infinity War is spoiler free

***** (5/5)

IT'S ALREADY CLEAR that the Marvel Cinematic Universe has installed a lot of pressure on themselves, with social media it's hard enough to create an ongoing trend, but as soon as the trailer for Marvel's 19th and biggest film Avengers: Infinity War launched it became the largest trailer ever on the web with more than 200 million views in just 24 hours. That was a monster record in itself as no other trailer has ever done that, addition to that the pre-sale tickets were selling like hot cakes. The pressure was perhaps too much at this point and there was quite a bit of speculation whether the film would live up to the almost infinite (sorry) hype, well, the time is here as brother directors Anthony and Joe Russo have created an unmissable Marvel film that delivers a dark storyline featuring shock to shock.

Firstly, Infinity War isn't just the culmination of the last few years of Marvel installments, it is the culmination of the last 18 Marvel in ten years, starting from the first Iron Man to now and take our word for it, it's worth every second of the ride. This one opens without the traditional Marvel fanfare overshadowing the logo, instead it's almost deafening, we open not long after the impact of Thor: Ragnarok with the destruction of Asgard and suddenly Thanos (Josh Brolin) a giant purple gilactic warlord puts the survivors to the ultimate test to try and possess all the six Infinity Stones which will put him in control of the entire universe. But it's from minute one that Thanos is not a villain that can be beaten with just the swing of a hammer (Thor should know that), the Avengers are put to the ultimate test.

Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) is challenged strength to strength. Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is tested through his limits. Captain America (Chris Evans) will find that this is no easy war to win. The story written by Captain America: Civil War writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely is dark, darker than all the previous Marvel films before, here nobody is left without a fight, and in terms of scope this has the biggest ever battle scene (but we'll get to that). And at the helm is Marvel's darkest, deadliest and strongest villain Thanos and it's Josh Brolin who's up for the role once again as he said at the end of Age of Ultron ""I'll do it myself"" and he delivers in spades delivering shock to shock, many dark turns and lots and lots of bodies at his feet. And it's clear that the Russo's have brought the impossible to life, and it won't leave without deeply cutting into your very skin.

How dark is the story? Well that really depends on how much light is at the end of the 149 minute long tunnel, but in terms of how many lives are at stake probably not much. But just like every other Marvel villain Thanos comes with a past, and Thanos' past isn't anything to be triffled with, a past that's filled with war, turmoil and death but anybody who knows his history should know how dark he really is, and despite the many family friendly filters there are through the never-ending saga, he is the darkest one ever. Yet, thanks to Brolin's fantastic performance he's also the most compelling, yes you heard that right he's even more compelling than Loki. But unlike the Asgardian God of Mischief the giant purple warlord isn't simply misunderstood, neigh, he's just a menace. However prepared you may be to watch Thanos putting the universe through ultimate destruction, you aren't ready for the damage he might leave behind, and put it this way, there's a lot of deep scars here, so prepare for the damage.

Yet, the film isn't always dark, there is some lightness here. It's also very, very funny. Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) is momentarily left speechless. The Guardians are up to to their usual high stakes camaradarie, Star Lord (Chris Pratt) isn't afraid to show his light self, Drax (Dave Bautista) once again shares his comedic duo act with Rocket (Bradley Cooper). It's almost as if McFeely and Markus watched both Guardians of the Galaxy films and jotted down all the jokes. But honestly who would blame them?

Happier still with a long running time, a compelling villain, an all star cast, some very funny jokes and several storylines to follow Avengers: Infinity War stays massively intact thanks to the Russo's exquisite directing style who handle the project beautifully, from handling the massive cast without feeling any fatigue (sorry Joss Whedon), through the expensive yet stunning CGI battles, to the mammoth sized final battle scenes. If you thought the battle of Sakovia in Avengers: Age of Ultron or the battle at Berlin's Leipzig airport in Captain America: Civil War was big then this is a mammoth battle. Indeed Infinity War is worth the decade long wait and who knows maybe the currently untitled Avengers 4 may be bigger than this. However big it is, we certainly can't wait.

VERDICT: Quick on it's wits and quick on it's whims, the 19th MCU film delivers all of them on an intergalactic scale, you may not be prepared for Thanos, but then neither are our heroes.",10

Superb,25 April 2018,Absolutely Amazing. Lives for the hype. I was surprised to see how serious this movie is compared to other MCU movies. If you're going to see this movie expecting those classics gags and one liners from the other movies this is not it. This movies has complex and emotional carachter arcs and it all comes down in such a perfect tone. 10 years lead up to this. Definitely worth the wait. The only downpoint is that it lacks the cosmic ingredients from the cosmic (if you read the story you know what I mean),9
Lot of potential. Only thing missing is a 1980s sitcom laugh track for the poor writing.,25 July 2018,,6
Not worth it,16 May 2018,"Lots of spectacle, clever banter & special effects. Lousy ending. It's really just a trailer for the sequel. I wasted my money.",2
So much to pack into 1 film - should Infinity Wars have been a trilogy?,26 April 2018,"First of all when I rate a film, I use this system for rating - 5 is a pass, 6-7 merit, 8+ distinction. I NEVER give a 10./10 because it's IMPOSSIBLE to make a perfect film. Thus my 8/10 would be 8.5 (distinction) if I could give half a star. Thus this film is VERY GOOD, but has a few issues.

Because of the nature of the film, there are a LOT of characters, so inevitably some characters (2 in particular) is glossed over. Even Stan Lee's cameo was as brief as it could be (but considering his health that is understandable. This is the ULTIMATE crossover movie - virtually all marvel movie is represented in some way.

To say this film is action packed is an understatement - if anything there is TOO much action - I could make a decent case this is 2 films rolled into 1 - hence the title of the review! Having said that, all action scenes were well done, and the issues re CGI I had against Black Panther weren't present here.

As was shown in trailers, Thanos is on a quest to gather all the infinity stones to complete his plans for the universe. As such, Vision is a key target. We begin however in the cosmos with the Ragnarok survivors in a spot of bother. Loki shows his best & worst, and my appreciation for what Tom Hiddleston has done with this character is never higher than here. From here keeps flashing between earth & the cosmic realm - bringing into play the guardians.

From here, it is standard MCU fair - if you've enjoyed any of the other movies, you will love this one. The big difference is Thanos - played fantastically by Cable - sorry Josh Brolin (nod to deadpoll ;-) ). and BOY has he done a fantastic job. All the claims that killmonger was the best villain in the MCU - are made to look VERY silly after watching Thanos. His plan is beyond diabolical, but the way he is played, it is quite possible to sympathise with him. Without saying WHAT he is trying to do, his motivations are to be benevolent! Whilst if he succeeded would be about as horrific as is possible, he doesn't do it to be evil destructive. In HIS mind, he is trying to prevent an even worse catastrophe! Yes the film plays it from Thanos's POV, and Thanos is taking a macro view of the universe! What is so great, is how Thanos is portrayed with a level of sympathy. It's as if Thanos doesn't WANT to do this, but he sees it a the only way to ultimately save the various species!

I can see why people may not like this, there's things in here that I wouldn't have done. But for me, there is NO QUESTION this is an excellent film - but unlike many of the recent MCU films, no way could you consider this a romp! It's a complete tonal change from Ragnarok. And that is what I love about the whole MCU. They aren't afraid to change a working formula.

I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, I've DELIBERATELY not discussed much, as this film needs to be seen - if nothing else Josh Brolin's performance. This DESERVES to make way much more money than Black Panther. When politics change, Black Panther will not date very will - Infinity War WILL in my view.

the trailers fairly represent the movie. You like them, you WILL love this. Oh and Peter Dinklage shows why he is such a giant talent!

An Entertaining Setup Story,16 August 2019,"I'd say that, overall, Endgame is a fun-ish movie. But I also thought that it jumped around quite a bit which made it difficult to feel immersed and connected with the characters. As soon as you started getting invested in one plot line, you were quickly whisked away to something else going on in another part of the Marvel Universe.

In addition to this, there are some odd joking moments that don't fit in well with the plot and characters and can take you out of the action if you're sensitive to those sorts of things; you'll throw out an eye roll a few times throughout this movie.

But overall, it's not a horrible movie!",6
10 years in the making ... it's worth the wait!,25 April 2018,"Hey everyone (Spider-Man voice),

I'm going to keep this review short and snappy and I won't dive into plot details (as requested by the Russo Brothers). #Thanosdemandsyoursilence I went into this movie with the mindset that I will be blown away and this will not only be a home run but out of the park. All I can say that my expectations were met. Thanos is the most powerful villain we've seen to date and the avengers, who are torn apart (following Civil War) are not prepared for this. And then insanity ensues accompanied with real stakes and potential dire consequences. It's a great story filled with twists and surprises. I enjoyed it a lot and I think so will everyone as I predict this will beat the opening weekend record (set by force awakens) and cross the $250 million line.

"Bold, brazen and ballsy stuff that isn't afraid to go dark; incredibly thrilling, nail-bitingly tense and satisfyingly unconventional.",29 April 2018,"'Avengers: Infinity War (2018)' is bold, brazen, ballsy stuff that's dark, daring and manages to deftly dodge all of the deep chasms that come with having the sheer amount of characters it has, all with rich histories and personalities as different from one another as their respective films are from this. It's remarkable how well it keeps each of these in focus while also keeping them true to who we know them to be, amalgamating their presences perfectly with this new tone so that nothing is lost yet nothing stands out. Admittedly, many of even the key players don't have much to do but all of them are well drawn and exist within the world in a tangible space, fulfilling their roles in the best way they possibly can. It feels as though this is the best version of a film with over twenty core characters that could have been accomplished. Besides, it's actually Thanos that's the 'star' and that is an unconventional and unexpected move. It's also one that pays off as he is easily the best, most intimidating and most understandable villian in Marvel's history. You empathise with him, on the most human of levels at times, and can even understand his point of view, just not his methods, whilst fearing his might as it lives up to all the hype it's been given. There's a real sense of forward-momentum and a proper pacy tension propelling the picture, leading to a series of confrontations that may be almost entirely digital but feel fully palpable thanks to excellent CGI and phenomenal writing. The script sets the stakes pretty much perfectly, weaving the interpersonal character motivations with the overall universal threat, and it paints a picture of a layered, all encompassing situation in which all our players play a part. It all comes to an unexpected and deliciously downbeat close, too. This is only dampened slightly, in execution and perception, because of the flick's 'Part I' nature - as well as the announcement of a few post-'Part II' MCU titles - which is actually the source of most of the film's minor issues. Without the context of the next film, there are some elements that don't quite seem 'real', but this could just be that they haven't sunk in yet because we don't know if they will be backtracked by the sequel or if they will be solidified by it. Still, as it is, this entry in the series is perhaps the most unconventional and unexpected flick the MCU has ever produced, one that stands on its own as a ballsy blockbuster unafraid to divide its audience. The tone is almost perfect, incredibly dark but with a dash of levity where it's called for (this is how you do 'serious', DC), and the pacing is great, too, even if it feels a tad long at times due to the unusual structure. It's just a breathlessly entertaining, incredibly thrilling, nail-bitingly tense, hopelessly jaw-dropping, edge-of-your-seat roller-coaster that does all of its characters, and its legacy, justice. Not to mention Alan Silvestri's phenomenal score. 9/10",9

Avengers: Infinity Wast,21 July 2018,"If you want to envoy this movie don't watch it as a cinephile, watch it as a geek. Then all those profusion of characters which doesn't make sense will appear to be so cool that you will ask for more. Yeah ""more and more"" could be an apropriate summary and at some point I was expecting Batman and Superman joining in the battle (even if they aren't from Marvel). From a marketing point of view putting as much characters as possible isn't a bad idea since you can target the largest audience possible but as a consequence the plot is going to suffer from it.

Concerning the CGI it was quite enjoyable to watch and I must admit that Thanos has a lot of personnality and was really well made. However I wasn't impressed by any of the battle's scenes and giving that budget it can be considered as a wast of money.

I expected more from that film but I don't want to be so rude and I'll give it a 6 because I was quite surprised by the ending. This may be the main strength of the movie!",6

"Here, there and everywhere",17 August 2018,"Not a major fan of Avengers, but this is the best of the lot but there are many flaws with Infinity War, one of them is the Thanos powers are not clearly consistant. The battles happen in a here there and everywhere fashion. It sometimes feel like different movies all put together and sometimes hard to follow whos doing what and for what purpose.

The battles scenes are great with exceptionally visuals and cgi but the purpose to defeat one undefeated villian is jumbled up. Infinity Wars is clearly an overated movie but deserves credit especially in the visuals and a simple plot which the movie intends to make it complex.

I didnt feel the superheroes powers like we did in their stand alone movies, its like a buffet.

The worst performance was The Hulk, he had absolutely no business in being there if he was not willing each time to show his powers.

I expected more from Infinity Wars since the big hype and thought they could have done more fighting as united Avengers to defeat one main villain. I know this might be done deliberately so that we can spend another 2,5 hours again for the next installment.

Nevertheless its still an entertaining movie that I liked but not love or drool over it like some fans, has its ups and down with top of the range visual effects.

Some say that it is so sad in the end, honestly I did not feel anything for them at the end, the ending is just bad, and it might turn out diffently in the next installment.

Between Black Panther and Infinity War, I would prefer Black Panther as it was more focused on the characters and story which is a better made film overall.

To have a rating of 8.6 on imdb is undeserving as these are mostly fanboys superior ratings.

To give where credit is due is only in the visuals and cgi and maybe in the difficulty in making such a huge movie with a huge cast that is why I give a 7 out of 10

Disappointing.,6 May 2018,,3
Absolutely Sensational.,26 April 2018,"SENSATIONAL, FUNNY, HEARTBREAKING, AWESOME! ILOVED this movie!!!

Now that's out the bag, let me get down to the grit.

After 10 years and 18 movies, finally, the War is here! As a spectacle summer popcorn movie this has no equal, as a technical achievement, there is no better, as a moving relationship drama with real depth and threat, The only other time I have experienced anything close was the LOTR trilogy... its that good!

Yes, its safe to assume that I am a Marvel fan-boy and may be just a tad biased in my opinions, however, I always try to go into MCU movies with an open mind, never expecting what happens on screen to rival the many stories I have consumed over the decades in the books. This does, in every possible way.

Less politically relevant than Black Panther but with ten times more heart, as funny as Ragnarok but with a million times the threat this is the culmination of thousands of hours of hard work and devotion from a studio who not only know what they are doing but also clearly love what they do too, and it shows In every beautifully framed shot, every character interaction and every emotional death scene, right up to the cliffhanger to rival that of the first Matrix.

The biggest surprise to me was Thanos. A genuine force of nature. The biggest bad in the MCU. The Mad Titan himself.... a loving father with a complicated back story and impossible decisions to make whilst carrying the fate of the universe on his vast shoulders! This is no doubt, 100% HIS movie. Brolin nails it, with the assistance of the best mo-cap in cinema history, he is able to convey a tortured, moving performance that resonates with the audience who can not help but almost agree with his logic, you almost want him to win!

The rest of the ensemble cast are great as usual, the dynamics between the team-ups are superbly handled, especially the scenes with the Guardians, who, thanks to Drax, inject most of the humour. The Tony Stark/Peter Parker relationship also expands on the groundwork laid in Civil War and continued in Homecoming, to great effect. Tony, more than ever truly cares for Pete and as such feels a greater sense of responsibility than ever. With great power, right? Furthermore, the Wanda/Vision, Quill/Gamora, Rocket/Groot, relationships are all dealt with incredibly well, with heartfelt emotion and genuine love for each other. Trust me, there will be lumps in throats! on the flip side is Thor and Cap, who are both dealing with loss, Thor dealing with the destruction of Asgard and Steve with the state of the fractured Avengers, they are very much the 'solo' heroes, both with nothing to lose, both at their most dangerous. Dr Strange also plays a huge part in the narrative of the film, however, alongside Hulk, Black Widow, War Machine, Falcon, Winter Soldier and Black Panther, they are very much the window dressing to fill the gaps between the main event.

The pacing of the movie is spot on, it really never felt like 2 and a half hour film and had Avengers 4 started right after I could have probably sat (on the edge of my seat) through that too!

If I had to find a negative it would probably be Hulk shaped, but that's really clutching at straws, this is an outstanding achievement and a milestone in cinema. Go see it. Go see it again, you will not be disappointed. I'm off to catch viewing number 3.",10
The Hype Is Real!,28 April 2018,,10
A fun blockbuster with not much more to it,25 April 2018,"Avengers Infinity War is probably one of the most anticipated movies of all time. With that being said it's no surprise that this film has so much weight riding on its shoulders. It seems that the biggest question most have is, Is it good? And the answer is yes, it's a pretty good film but it's not the best.

First off with the good stuff. The characters are done very well, and most are given a time to shine. The Russo Brothers also do a very good job with the action, like Snyder levels of awesomeness. And it's ending is one of the best in the MCU.

Now with some of the bad stuff. The sad thing is that for everything the movie does right there's something done wrong. For example, there's no substance to the film, there's nothing more to it than action. It's feels like a Micheal Bay movie at points. And the sub villains are extremely underused, there's so much promise to them but the movie hardly ever gives them a chance to shine.

Is it the movie to end all movies, no. But in the end it's not a deep character study like The Dark knight nor is it as good. It's not as funny as past films and sometimes the continuity of the characters is sometimes confusing. But it's a fun blockbuster with not much more to it.",9

Approaches characters from a broad perspective rather than superficially,3 November 2023,"I think this is the coolest of the Avengers movies. It has a fast pace from start to finish and this action adds power to the movie. The development of the characters is reflected well. Not giving enough screen time to each character can be considered a somewhat negative effect. Some seem more. Making a movie with so many characters must be a difficult task, but it seems to have been overcome. In my opinion, it can be said to be one of the best superhero movies. One of the advantages of the film, and perhaps the most important one, is that it approaches the characters from a broad perspective rather than superficially.",7
The Best of Marvel Studios,29 April 2018,"Wow, Marvel knocked it out of the park with this one. This is a totally different movie from anything Marvel has ever done before. First, I'll start out with the tone. This movie is dark. Marvel is sometimes criticized for being to light and happy, and I thought this was the opposite of that. Infinity War gives you a sense of hopelessness, sadness, and anger. It honestly felt like my soul was crushed, and everytime I think about the movie the feeling stays the same. Just because the movie made me feel these things, it was still great. I think that is one of the reasons you know a movie is good is that it gets you to feel these emotions about fictional characters. If you're scared about it being too dark, don't worry, there is some balanced humor throughout the movie, which for the most part I was fine with.

I thought everyone's screen time was balanced pretty well if they were a main character (Tony, Dr. Strange, Thor, etc), but if your favorite character is minor (Bucky, Okoye, Shuri, etc) don't be expecting a whole lot of screentime. However, I do wish Steve got more time. The Russo Brothers said Thanos and Thor would have a lot of screen time, and I agree with them on that. The movie shows Thanos in an interesting light which really makes you think about what he's doing. I loved Thanos as a villain. What he is doing is horrible, but the amount of emotion he shows really makes you feel for him.

Everyone's acting is incredible. A special shout out to Tom Holland and Elizabeth Olsen because they did an EXCELLENT job of portraying their characters feelings, which indeed made me cry. The cinematography is amazing as well. Later when I post a spoiler review I'll talk about some of my favorite shots, but for right now I'll just say when I saw one of the planets, the way it was portrayed was beautiful.

I love movie soundtracks. I listen to them sometimes on my free time, which makes me sound like a huge dork, which I am. My favorite soundtrack is Civil War, and Infinity War is up there too. The music is awesome when characters are introduced, and it also is downright depressing at times.

My favorite part right now is the ending. I am going to see the movie again to think about it more, but right now I do have one scene in my head that is my personal favorite. I'm sure if you've seen the movie you probably can guess it. The way the characters relationship was showed and how scared him/her was, it just broke my heart.

As if the movie couldn't get anymore depressing, the credits were dark and desolate. The music was solemn. But as always, STAY TO THE VERY END. Maybe that'll lift your spirits a little :)

Thank you to everyone at @MarvelStudious and @TheRussoBrothers . Why do you have to make me wait a year!!! I don't know how I'm going to make it. I'm going to try to see the movie again this weekend.",10

Awesome Movie,24 May 2018,"Some of the reviews writen here blow my mind on how ignorant people can be when they are watching a movie about a comic book.

Hey, guess what, the unoriginal script is based on a series of comics from the 90's, there's nothing really new here, except for the unfortunate lack of key Characters (mainly Silver Surfer and Adam Warlock) wich are too deep to be presented on this movie (case of Adam) or belong to other studior (case of Silver Surfer, the Fantastic Four, X-men), and the writers need to make a few changes, but that's all.

I guess no one is dumb enough to think that everyone that died in the movie, will remain dead. Marvel doesn't think we are that stupid as well, cause guardians of the galaxy 3 is confirmed to 2020.

I'm sorry to say, but this kind of review, saying the script is unoriginal e full of obvious deaths and turn arounds, is very, very stupid.

It's like watching a biography, and complain about it, because you knew what was going to hapen, even before watching the movie.",10

Good but not great,24 April 2019,"My rating is weak 8/10 but I almost gave it 1 because it is so overrated and sooo overhyped. I think the movie is very enjoyable and very funny at sometimes but it has problems and its not perfect.

I really dont like what they did with the Captain America. He was there just to show off with his beard. And I like that the Thor is most powerful but I dont like that he didnt use powers untill he got stormbreaker. Star-Lord is in my top 10 heroes and they just ruined him in this movie. Movie has some plot holes that im not gonna mention. And all deaths after the snap felt forced. Fanboys are saying it is best superhero movie ever. I mean, its not even best mcu film I think Civil War, GOTG and Iron Man are better movies.

Overall as I said very enjoyable and funny but I still dont think it deserves 8.5...",
Not as good and not as bad as many write,29 May 2018,"This movie is actually better than I expected but not in the top 100 movies of all time nor in the top 10 of this year. Don't expect much or any character development in this movie. 95% of all the characters were already introduced in previous Marvel movies. You would have had to have seen at least ten others marvel movies to get any joy out of this movie .

So this one goes straight to the action .The super heroes are in groups and they fight separate fights and the movie seems scattered . The obvious plot does not make up for it, the characters do not develop further , it often feels more like a good computer game then a movie. So cannot give it more than a 7 * .

It is not as bad as you might expect from such a movie and the plot does get a bit more interesting, however simplistic it is... Super heros are no longer invincible , unfortunately many of them are still far from human . We cannot really identify with them or estimate if any of their actions actually make any sense - we are a spectators, like spectators of a video game we have never seen before.. For example how much punishment can a super hero or super villain take before he dies, we have no idea and there is no gauge. Sometimes they just get up again other times not..

The movie does have some interesting sub plots and parts to it , yes even the villains have a human side. Nevertheless the main villains motive for wanting to destroy half the universe is unsatisfactory, at best .

The good part is that it is not too predictable, the movie has good CGI and well actually good actors in most of the roles.",7
"Epicness of Transformers, but with story and characters fully intact! Masterpiece!",1 May 2018,"It's like Transformers, but with a story intact! All the Transformers movies were epic to me, but as the sequels came, the stories got more and more lost. Not Avengers: Infinity War. As an ex-comic collector (over 15 years), I was quite well acquainted with Thanos. My biggest worry was how they were going to pull off a weird looking hulk of an alien like him and not make him look like a doofus. Pulled off they did. Thanos was convincing and menacing, but most importantly he felt ""real"". Of course, no one can fault the fantastic, solid cast in the Avengers - Captain America, Iron Man, Spider-Man, Scarlet Witch, Dr Strange, etc. (though I missed Hawkeye) were all rock-solid and it's amazing how their characters shined through despite the very very full cast of the Marvel Universe. The action was epic - this is where it reminds me of Transformers - where the CGI was fantastic, blended well, etc. The difference? Infinity War had a rock-solid story that tied in all the characters really well, and it had a whole raft of emotions - funny, sad, poignant, shocking, surprising, mindblowing moments all came through the movie. It is one truly epic movie that deserves to be on the big screen. I love it, and can't wait for the next part. Highly, highly recommended.",9
For the Marvel fans,27 December 2018,If you are a Marvel fan then you've probably already watched this movie and really enjoyed it.

A Herculean feat of Screenwriting and Directing,27 April 2018,"I'm not a big ""fan"" of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

Just wanted to get that out of the way right here and now before people begin to question my allegiance or my bias of where I stand before I start this review.

As I have told many people, I do not blindly follow this series of films wherever they may go. I enjoy Marvel when they make GOOD films, just as I would any other studio, director, writer, etc.

In some cases, I find the MCU films to feel almost ""cookie-cutter"" when they are at their worst. The acting is fine, the action is fine, cinematography is typically 'safe' and doesn't break new ground as often as a series of this magnitude really should. No real risks are taken. I think of 'safe' when I think of many of their films, which isn't BAD, per-say, but I wish these films would be more risky in how they handle their material.

Try something new...Trying something daring...Try something DIFFERENT...

Well. My wishes were granted. In spades.

'Avengers: Infinity War' is not a perfect film. In fact, it's not even the best film in the MCU. However, it was absolutely EVERYTHING it was billing itself to be. It IS new. It IS daring. It IS different.

But let's un-pack that before I lose myself here. Because there's certainly A LOT to talk about...in NO SPOILER terms ;)

The tone of this film, without giving anything major away, is by far the bleakest of any of these films have dared to go. This storyline and these characters that they have been teasing for 10 years are now paying-off massively, as we are now seeing real consequence in this world that has been established. Your favorite characters are here, yes, but they ARE at-risk against a threat that isn't treated lightly. There isn't any awful Yo Mama jokes like in TLJ to dilute the drama and tone.

This is DARK, and the Russo Brothers do not let you off of that ride for you or the childrens' comfort level, which is precisely what I think this part of the story needed. The many comparisons I have seen to 'Empire Strikes Back' are not invalid, as its tone, manner, and even themes are extremely similar in more ways than one.

I can tell the Russo Brothers, fresh off of 'Winter Soldier' and 'Civil War', were allowed to make a film that resembles their film, and not a studio mandate. They make decisions that I KNOW will be extremely unpopular with a lot of people, but unlike a certain franchise tentpole, this film does it without self-destructing the reason we come for these films, which is intrinsically the characters and this massive, sprawling story.

Let's move on to that topic, The Characters. By far the strongest bone in this film's body is the characters and character interaction, as most Marvel films seem to excel at. After 10 years, we see all of these characters we've grown to love come-together and interact, and my goodness is it everything we have been waiting for. The dialogue here is sharp when it needs to be witty, is slow when we reach the emotional valleys, it can even reach heartwarming and heartbreaking at some points depending on what connection you have forged with these characters over the last few years.

A character I find particularly captivating in this film, however, is the antagonist itself. Thanos, believe it or not, is an extremely interesting character once we see him and learn what he's all about and capable of. This isn't another case of ""big bad Marvel bad guy man"". He is genuinely a character I find fascinating, which shows Marvel took notes as far as I'm concerned. If anyone's fear was that they would get him wrong after 6 years of building him up, consider those fears squashed. This is a Marvel VILLAIN, and I mean that in the best way possible.

To combine both prior points, hats off to screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely for managing to juggle all of these characters and such a massive story and manage to make it COHERENT. Under many other writers' watches, this likely would have been A MESS, but the way the story progressed and characters were incorporated was, for the most part, expertly done. Every character gets a moment of their own, the ones we truly care for get integral arcs over the film's massive run-time, and in the end we hardly feel that certain characters were left out of the proceedings. I wondered how they would manage all of these characters, and they managed to walk the tightrope without falling.

The score is also a welcome and noticeable addition, as the talents of composer Alan Silvestri ('Back to the Future', 'The Avengers', 'Predator') were brought back for this film. There are plenty of excellent pieces of music in the film, along with the Avengers theme itself (The only noticeable orchestral pieces these films really has ever had), and it is welcome to have excellent music in these films again after the disaster Brian Tyler and Danny Elfman presented to us in 'Age of Ultron'. The music only adds to the feel of the film, which is what good movie music should rightfully do.

Now, all of this considered, this film is NOT perfect. In fact, a couple glaring flaws made themselves apparent throughout the film, though they were moreso ""Tiny cracks"" than ""Gaping holes"", so to speak.

For starters, the action cinematography is actually shockingly bad in the early half of the film. At some points, I could barely tell what was even supposed to be happening. The fights in the early part of the film suffer from SCS, or should I say ""Shaky Cam Syndrome"", as we are over-stimulated and shown too much CG in these portions to process what we're supposed to be looking at. That said, the action cinematography does improve as the film moves along, so this isn't a problem that knocks-out the foundations of the film. However, the action early on is NOTICEABLY bad, which certainly hurts.

Editing at times was also rather choppy, as odd choices are made in some portions of the film that made me scratch my head. I can't name anything in particular, though most of my issues with the editing stemmed from odd transitions and segues that almost looked like ""abandoned transitions"", where an attempt was seemingly made to stitch two scenes together...and then proceeded to be hacked-and-slashed to trim 2 seconds off the run-time, for some odd reason.

And that's perhaps my only real issue with this film; the flow of the film. So much of it feels as if it's begging to be smoother, but instead there are sequences where it simply feels too long or too short in places. At some points, we will be on a plot thread, cut-away from it, and will not return to said thread until 20-25 minutes later. I genuinely feel that this sort of thing could have been fixed with a better editor, or simply a smoother-written story, though considering how already miraculous it is that this film managed to be coherent with how much it had to juggle, perhaps the odder pacing was only a by-product of trying to assemble all of this together.

But in the end, is this massive assemblage of Marvel films and characters a success? Is this the film that is worth all the hype of 10 years and an entire film franchise has been leading up to?

Yes.

'Infinity War' is a tremendously fun time at the cinemas. It is quite literally an 'Epic', sprawling across so many characters, universes, worlds, tones, etc. This film feels like an event, which it may very well be, and I can safely say the Russo Brothers and writers Markus and McFeely as well pulled off a miracle and made such a Herculean task of a film into something I think is a great summer blockbuster and a tremendous first part of what is sure to be a grand finale for this universe we've seen grow over a decade.

I may not be a huge Marvel fan, but this is certainly a GOOD film. In fact, I'd dare say a GREAT one.",8

Quick Infinity War review,1 May 2018,"Avengers: Infinity War is by far Marvel's most ambitious film ever. And it mostly pays off, after 10 years of buildup. With incredible effects, masterful sound design, great characters complimented by a fantastic cast, and some of the best action in marvel films. However it's uneven tone, some unfocused characters, and probably some of the worst comic relief in a Marvel film hold it back from being a great film. Nonetheless, the end result is a blast from start to finish, that should satisfy fans.",7
Thanos War,25 April 2018,"It is a well balanced movie. Best Marvel movie in the whole franchise. It has a cohesive plot and flow. Thanos War is an apt title as this movie focuses on the villain more then the 20 or so superheroes enlisted to fight him. You get to see the world from thanos's eyes. A different perspective which is what makes it different and better. If you waited for an epic Thanos movie you have got it.

Thanos gets fully fleshed out and his motives and desires become clear. It shows what he is prepared to lose in order to gain his goals. He is the only decent villain to come from marvel and rightfully so as the stakes are never higher. There is plenty of action and it isn't just mindless fighting.

There are only some flaws but you forget them cause the movie is good.",8
50/50,19 January 2022,"An uneven and ambiguous film that has both undeniable advantages and obvious disadvantages inherent in all Marvel crossovers. The advantages of the film include the colorful villain Thanos with finally clearly prescribed motivation, a lot of locations and special effects, the drama of individual scenes and the meeting of almost all the characters from the Marvel cinematic universe. Cons: a long, sometimes sagging plot with a bunch of logical holes, a very uneven distribution of characters, with well-defined individual characters (Thor) and completely lost in the film (Doctor Strange, Bucky), weak interaction between the characters, humor at the level of Petrosian's sketches and inarticulate musical arrangement.

It was hilarious at some points while still being heartwrenching at others. It portrayed all of the MCU characters very well and gave all of them major rolls in the story while not overpowering any one of them. This movie took major risks and I believe that Marvel executed it to perfection. Overall, Avengers: Infinity War is filled with heart, humor, and sacrifice that help redefine what a hero should be. The Russo brothers have crafted an epic of galactic proportions that will have fans contemplating long after the credits roll.",10
An unforgettable experience,14 April 2023,"Avengers: Infinity War is a true cinematic achievement, brilliantly constructed in its scope and execution. The film is not only an incredible action-packed extravaganza but also a masterclass in storytelling, weaving multiple storylines in a seamless and exciting way.

At the heart of the movie lies the incredible villain, Thanos, played with captivating intensity by Josh Brolin. His journey to collect the infinity stones is given great depth and purpose, making it a Thanos film as much as it is an Avengers' movie. Thanos' presence is felt throughout the entire film, and he truly serves as the driving force of the story.

In addition to Thanos, the film's scope is truly awe-inspiring. The sheer number of characters from the Marvel Cinematic Universe that the movie brings together is nothing short of remarkable. The interactions between fan-favorite characters like Iron Man, Doctor Strange, Captain America, and Thor are nothing short of epic, and the film plays to the strengths of each character perfectly.

The action in the film is also nothing short of spectacular. The sequences are well-choreographed and offer plenty of thrills and excitement. The stakes are high, and the film is unafraid to take risks that leave a lasting impact on the audience.

Avengers: Infinity War is a tour-de-force of superhero filmmaking. The film is brilliantly executed with a compelling villain, seamless storytelling, and spectacular action.

I won't waste my time and money on the next one.",1
True meaning of epicness,17 August 2018,"This movie is perhaps the most anticipated movie of the year, maybe even of all time. So naturally, I went in the theater with really high expectations. With that, comes the fear that the movie won't live up to its hype. However, Infinity War manages to keep me on the edge of my seat from the beginning to end. With recent Marvel installments being rather stale, the addition of the Russo brothers really took Marvel in the right direction. For the first time, you can really feel the struggles and despair from our favorite heroes. The overall theme and tone are more mature than ever before. Great move from Marvel to keep audiences engaged. Infinity War is, in my opinion, the best marvel movie up to date.",10
10/10 Everything here what I wanted,29 April 2018,Perfectly balanced! Russo brothers done a fantastic job. I had doubts how will they present all the heroic characters in one movie. But they nailed it!! Love you guys.,10
An interesting ending,20 November 2021,I enjoyed the movie. Its still the same line story. The Avengers fight against the Vilain and try to win. Tanos is very well made and very impressive to see. The end is pretty surprising and make us wonder what happened to the Heroes in the next movie.,8

The Greatest Superhero movie in a while,29 April 2018,"Seriously, The only thing I compare to this is The Dark Knight triology, WATCH IT NOW",10
An awesome action movie that makes little sense,18 August 2018,"The CGI is great, the acting is good, the action is wonderful, Thanos is really scary, every hero (almost) is here. And yet things make little sense. There are again confusion between forces that have many orders of magnitude between them, there is little strategic or, indeed, tactical logic in this ""war"". I enjoyed the film and I am sure it's going to blow so many people away, but it was so damn pointless.

Anyway, the idea is that the movie is just the first of a two parter so my recommendation is to wait until both movies have been released and watch them back to back. I know it's hard, with all the references flying around you and friends wanting to discuss how Star Lord destroyed the universe (oops!), but I think you will enjoy the ending a lot more knowing you will be watching the rest in a few minutes and not next year.",8

X-Force + Avengers + Magneto = Good!,26 June 2018,"SPOILERS: Justified expectation of the fan MARVEL I decided to make my review of the third part of the Avengers. Immediately I can say that I'm doing reviews for the first time.

So, I like watching movies MARVEL, and I was happy to wait for this part, like everyone else, because it was the fate of the car-kicking MARVEL. But in a year there will be ""Avengers 4"", but the third part did what other films MARVEL could not. And this is the death of the main characters to the clicks of Thanos. I was very surprised. I can tell only the pros and cons of this film:

Pluses:

* Thank you for long-wating DEATH Loki! ...

Unexpected twists and turns, like the mysterious location of the last Infinity stone - the Soul stone, well-designed special effects and graphics, a huge number of MARVEL heroes and of course Thanos. The Rousseau brothers made a real villain of Thanos with normal motivation. This bastard is ready for anything for the sake of stones and will not stop at nothing. We can hate it somewhere in moments, understand it and empathize with it. I believe that Josh Brolin perfectly got used to this character. The main female characters are as always ideal and good, an excellent soundtrack, action scenes and good humor in some moments.

Minuses:

Unjust ending, stupid actions of the main characters, more that some characters forgot their abilities, or at the right time they did not use them at the first opportunity. Also, I did not like the fact that Falcon's eyes were not shown with the Ant-Man. Although we were told that they would appear in this film. Too much pathos and prolonged dialogue.

Conclusion:

Despite the shoals of the film, he may like everyone, even those who begin to get acquainted with the films about superheroes. But I strongly recommend that you first look at all 18 movies of the movie-market MARVEL before watching the third Avengers. And also it's a pity that the competitors of DC can not withdraw their kinomiks, which will surpass the War of Infinity. Although the DC comes out Aquaman and Shazam, but still they can not surpass this masterpiece. Still very happy for the fact that this film Joss Weedon did not shoot, but he could turn into an unfriendly comedy.

Objective review,28 April 2019,,7
Worth the hype!,1 May 2018,,9
The Best of Marvel,19 June 2020,"Avengers Infinity War is the best movie in marvel universe by far. In fact it is the only one with very decent plot development and minimum holes within. This movie unlike other superhero movies have actually well done in the story telling and putting the pieces of the story together. Beside holding you on the edge of the seat the whole time, you ask yourself the ""How"" and ""Why"" logic-killing questions much much fewer times in compare to most other similar films. Also, the funny scenes and especially the emotional scenes are very interesting and are not only for killing the time and stretching the movie. Although, in order to fully understand the characters and relations you must be familiar to Marvel's universe, It is not necessary and you can still enjoy this one even if you haven't watched anything in Marvel universe before. This movie truly deserve the attention that it got and absolutely worth your time.

So, Don't miss this one even if you are not a fan of superhero movies or only because you are not familiar with Marvel. It would still entertain you greatly.",7
"Self-parody, but not funny nor original",3 July 2019,"The modern Marvel cinematic universe's excuse for ""comedy"" is a bunch of one-liner wisecracks that take on one of two forms: 1) camaraderie in the form of friendly jabs between characters, whether extant or to build up new friendships, or 2) to actually make fun of the movie itself. Functionally, the wisecracks are tacked on to make the movies take on a ""lighter"" feel to contrast the darker themes they sometimes tackle. There's nothing fundamentally wrong with this approach, except that executionally the lines just aren't that funny, too frequent, tryhard, and awkward, sometimes even going as far as to ruin a potentially epic moment by cheapening it beforehand or afterwards. Not to mention that this formula for ""comedy"" is carbon copied across almost all modern Marvel movies, so it gets tiresome quickly. Just because the filmmakers themselves point out how bad or cheesy a scene is does not somehow make it better. A self-parody without the humor therefore becomes a farce of a film.

Another problem modern Marvel movies face is that they rely on the viewer to have seen each and every movie that has ever come out in the entire franchise, else risk great confusion. This makes each movie not stand alone on its own merits, but only in relation to the other 40 or 50 behind them. Television would perhaps be an objectively better format for these kinds of long-winded many-charactered chapters, but the ticket sales keep coming in, so why fix what ain't broken? It is a challenge to even critique this film as it stands on its own, without also critiquing ""modern Marvel movies"" as a whole. Indeed nothing felt different or unique about this particular installment in the series, more of the same formula.

The biggest problem in this movie was simply its sheer number of characters, and once again most other modern Marvel movies share this problem too. The scope was so large that nothing seemed to have progressed whatsoever until the last 30 minutes of runtime. The first 2 hours took on too broad a scope as it slogged forward into a big confusing jumbled mess constantly hopping from character to character, almost rendering it pointless to even bother. Certainly it must have been challenging to incorporate every single character the franchise has ever seen, but was there really a pressing need to do so in the first place?

Robert Downey, Jr. had a surprisingly down-trodden role this time around, rather than his typical comic relief sharp-witted self. He can act in any capacity so there was nothing bad about the acting, but it also didn't leave much of an impression, nor stand out in any way. He was just kind of there. In fact, every character in the entire movie besides Thanos felt like they were ""just there"". No character really had a chance to shine or be themselves, instead melding into ""one united Avengers"" character. Perhaps this was intentional, as all needed to unite against Thanos to stop him, but it just went too far: every character's individuality was severely compromised, and the only truly indelible impression left on the viewer's psyche after watching this movie was Thanos, Thanos, Thanos.

The ending at least picked up a little bit and finally had a focus, even a bit of a shock. But it doesn't feel fully believable, as we all know deep down it's not permanent. After all, this is a fantastical universe with many excuses to undo it.

Lack of individuality permeated throughout: as a movie, in the action & choreography, in the directing style, the composition, cinematography, even the characters.",2
"Very entertaining, best Avengers yet.",29 April 2018,"Even though the storyline is nothing like the comic, it was very enjoyable and I do like how they approached it without having the rights to all the original characters involved.

What i wanted and what everyone wanted.,26 April 2021,This movie is perfect. Marvel pulled this off amazingly with us being re-introduced to the characters after civil war was amazing.

What an emotional roller coaster. There were a few times where I almost cried. The detail of the movie, the acting, the directing, the music, the countless hours of special effects work that went into this movie.....beyond my imagination! Well and beyond my expectations of a Marvel movie. But this is not your normal Marvel movie. This is a HEAVY movie. Please see at your own discretion.",10
Wonder how many movies like this Marvel can create? Maybe never,11 July 2022,"This is the result of 10 years. And it's incredibly effective. When you create a good enough villain, the superheroes around him only need to appear for a few seconds. But everyone knows these heroes well, they all have their own movies that have been released before. So can I consider this a solo movie about Thanos lol.

To create a villain like Thanos, perhaps Marvel's producers also need luck. He is too perfect, from appearance to personality and purpose of life. He makes all other superheroes worthy of mere supporting characters. Because his ideals have convinced viewers. And superheroes can only fight him through tolerance and peace-loving hearts. And no one can use reason to defeat Thanos.

I'm pretty reserved and concerned that Marvel will create another villain, another super movie that brings together many superheroes and creates a movie of great quality like this one. Because that's very, very difficult. This is probably the best Marvel movie of all.

My emotions were filled by this movie. Although there are scenes that are not suitable for children, like the scene where Iron Man is beaten by Thanos, and the scene where Loki is strangled to death, this is what I like, because movies are for all ages.

Of course if I had a friend around 10 years old I wouldn't recommend this movie. ""Wait a few more years"" lol so violent.",9
Too bad this wasn't the Final instead of End Game,7 March 2021,"This movie is exactly what you wanted in a popcorn summer flick.

A film that capitalized on the 10 years of characterization that preceded it,28 April 2018,"Avengers: Infinity War is a spectacle to behold to the general audience. To the avid Marvel Studios fan, however, it is the epitome of movie going. It spends next to no time explaining the close relationships some characters share, and instead, builds the most memorable villain since Heath Ledger's Joker. If you have watched all of the other Marvel movies up to this point, you will be delighted, debilitated, and craving more.",10
Comedy Was Good But,5 May 2018,,7
A Gripping Epic of Superhero Proportions,21 May 2023,"Avengers: Infinity War is a gripping and epic superhero film that brings together the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe in a battle against their most formidable foe yet, Thanos. Directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, the film features an all-star cast, including Robert Downey Jr., Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, and many more.

The film is a masterful blend of action, drama, and humor. The action sequences are stunning, with intricate fight scenes and explosive set pieces that keep you on the edge of your seat. The drama is intense, with high stakes for all of the characters involved. And the humor is well-placed and never feels forced, providing much-needed levity in the midst of the chaos.

One of the strengths of this film is its ability to balance so many characters and storylines. The film weaves together multiple plot threads from the various Marvel films, creating a cohesive and engaging narrative. The film also introduces new characters, such as the Guardians of the Galaxy, seamlessly integrating them into the larger universe.

The performances in this film are top-notch. The cast is clearly invested in their roles, and their chemistry is palpable. The film also features a standout performance from Josh Brolin as Thanos, who manages to make the character both terrifying and sympathetic.

Overall, Avengers: Infinity War is a must-see for any superhero fan. With its gripping storyline, stunning action, and outstanding performances, it is a worthy addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The film is a testament to the power of the superhero genre and a thrilling ride from start to finish.",8

I thought civil war was the worst movie in the franchise and it gave me a lower expectation for upcoming avengers films (yes it was technically a captain America film, but I mean it really wasn't was it..), but this movie was so well written with some emotional moments, I'd totally recommend it to people who enjoy a long, breathtaking but also overwhelming movie. 9/10",10

"Finally, an Avengers movie that actually maxes out the potential of an Avengers movie!",14 November 2019,"When I saw the trailer for Infinity War I was like any other MCU fan boy...I squealed and screamed and I was like HFS this is going to be amazing!!!! It is no exaggeration to say that Infinity War delivers on every level despite having the unenviable task of telling a HUGE story and somehow balancing this story that takes place on two planets with more super heroes then there have been in any super hero movie before or since.

This is a task that would be difficult for even the most seasoned of film makers. Fortunately they brought on the writers from Captain America The First Avenger, Winter Soldier and Civil War. Of course the one thing that made this whole thing work was the Russo brothers. At the end of the day those two guys and all the talent involved pulled everything together and delivered something truly special.

Infinity War finds Thanos and his Black Order: Ebony Maw, Corvus Glaive, Proxima Midnight and Cull Obsidian searching for the Infinity Stones. Along the way, the Guardians meet up with Thor, Doctor Strange, Iron Man, Spider-man in an effort to stop the mad Titan.

Coming back from his self imposed exile is the man himself, Captain America who realizes that even though the Avengers are scattered, him, Black Widow, Falcon, Bruce Banner, War Machine, Black Panther and the armies of Wakanda are the only ones who can possibly stand in the way of Thanos carrying out his plan to destroy half the life in the universe.

Infinity War is a staggering sci-fi, action-packed, highly emotional piece of cinema that will bring out the tears in even the staunchest of movie critics. The finale of this movie is... something to behold. You know this movie worked when it leaves you thinking ""My God... NOW WHAT?!"".

Avengers Infinity War has everything I wished the first two Avengers films could have been, and it's obviously necessary viewing for anybody who wants to see Endgame. Obviously though, a LOT of MCU movies are mandatory viewing for going into Endgame anyway.

Filmmakers will be hard pressed to make something more compelling for many generations to come.",
"I Don't Usually Give Superhero Flicks 10s, But...",28 June 2018,Avengers Infinity War is the definition of mania. Everything just finally unravels on screen and it certainly messes with your mentality if you've been sticking around with the franchise for the past ten years. I'm more than pleased with this exhilarating MCU flick. (Verdict: A),7
#Movie Review,15 August 2021,"Avengers: Infinity War (2018) is one of the most ambitious movies made by Marvel so far. As time passes, the number of movies increases. Likewise, the number of heroes is also increasing, thus it gets significantly more difficult to create a plot involving everyone without it becoming a mess. The Russo brothers surprisingly manage to pull this off with a coherent, well-structured plot. I enjoyed the beginning-ending relation and the fact that everything that's happening on the screen has a meaning that you'll later understand as the story unfolds.

As much as I enjoyed Avengers: Infinity War (2018), the movie isn't perfect. Even though the Russo brothers have done a fantastic job, there'll always be repercussions when it comes to a story involving plenty of characters. The focus gets quite blurry since the movie has to jump back and forth to give everybody a chance to shine.

Nevertheless, this movie was a BLAST!",9
Fanboys will ignore anything!,30 April 2018,,6
Overrated,2 May 2018,I don't know how or who rated it above 8. Really disappointed,5
10 years in the making,29 April 2018,"Avengers Infinity War is probably one of the most anticipated films of all time but does it live up to the hype? Yes it totally does live up to the hype and exceeds all expectations. In no way is Infinity war a perfect film as much as I wanted it to be but it is extremely ambitious and one of the best the MCU has to offer.

Avengers Infinity war finally gives us what we've waiting for so long, one massive event which brings all our favorite characters together fighting against the big bad Thanos. Thanos is finally here and he truly is spectacular but more on him later.

Let's begin with the fact that this film is super ambitious. To fit dozens of characters and several plot-lines into one cohesive two and a half hour film is no easy task but the Russo's have done it. The film feels grand andEpic. The film could've suffered from pacing issues what with all the characters and several things happening in different locations but it never feels rushed or slow but just right. The visual effects are spot on especially when it comes to creating elaborate fight sequences and realistic looking characters like Thanos and his children who are all computer generated.

Almost all the characters that we know and love are in this film and its quite awesome to see them interact. Watching characters that have never met each other before finally meet and fight together was like a dream come true. The banter between the heroes is well written and the chemistry between the characters is just perfect. The movie explored Doctor strange's powers a lot more which was fantastic but failed to do the same with Scarlett Witch as she does the same stuff she's been doing ever since Age of Ultron. Several characters get their jaw dropping goosebumps inducing moments that made the audience go crazy. Characters that stood out in this film for me would be Doctor Strange, Thor, Iron man and of course Thanos.

Before I get into Thanos I would like to address one of the gripes I had and that is the children of Thanos, Korvus Glaive, Proxima midnight, Cull obsidian and Ebony Maw. These four looked great but there was nothing much under the surface. They were just mini bosses the heroes had to fight before Thanos. But for the most part I can forgive that because of Thanos is the best MCU villain ever. Thanos is great at beating the crap out of everyone but he was also a villain I could empathize with. He had compelling motivations and a lot of character depth. What's great about Thanos is that he isn't just a large strong guy but a character you can care about. Josh Brolin is perfect as Thanos and I can't think of anyone who could have done it better.

The fight sequences are well balanced with each character getting their time to shine. Creating a long and elaborate fight scene with multiple characters takes a lot of planning and hard work but the Russo's have done it well before and they did it even better this time. The comedy is present and for the most part is handled properly but sometimes they do manage to ruin serious moments with jokes that don't always work.

Avengers Infinity War is a near masterpiece that has it all. From spectacle to shocking twists and revelations and a perfect villain. I highly recommend Avengers Infinity war and I'm gonna go with a 9 out of 10",9
WOW! JUST WOW!,28 December 2018,I am totally shook and mindblown. I can't believe how good and bad this movie is all at the same time. I can't believe they let the movie end the way it did but there has to be another in the works. Thanos is totally and completely pure EVIL just like the EVIL lying crooked corrupt chump trump and his family and administration. This movie will make you cheer the good guys and break your heart all at the same time. There has got to be more in the works.,10
Amazing,28 December 2018,This is a great movie. Entertaining to the max with absolutely stunning action scenes. Amazing emotional ending that leaves you breathless.,10
Overall...,29 April 2018,,9
The ending was totally unexpected. This one is too sad.,1 April 2020,,8
Epochal beginning of the end of the story about the Greatest heroes of the Earth!,11 September 2021,"It is very difficult to objectively evaluate such a movie, since it was created by fans and for fans. This is a grand crossover that unites all the heroes of all the films, however, realizing that there is not enough screen time for everyone, Anthony and Joe Russo make the perfect move by exposing the main villain, the main character. Yes, 'Infinity War' is Thanos ' solo album.

Let's start our analysis of the film with the villain, the main plus of the film, the mad titan. Thanos is a great character, he is very well written, and in the course of the film you involuntarily get into his ideas and thoughts. And all because he has a clearly formed goal and plan. The idea of the directors works 100%, turning the mad titan into a cult villain not only in the Marvel cinematic universe, but also in cinema as a whole.

Side villains are the children of Thanos, who serve as assistants. They don't particularly cling to anything, but they don't reject it either.

It is difficult to single out the main characters of the film. But if you count by screen time, then these are Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), Captain America (Chris Evans) and Thor (Chris Hemsworth). Anyway, there are most of them in the frame and all the other characters act as side characters. The trio goes through personal growth and at the end of the film they are not the same as they were before, this is also a plus.

The side characters are essentially assistants to the main trio and it is very difficult to reveal everyone, there are solo albums and future projects for this. I would like to mention Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen), this character also goes through personal growth.

The visual of the film is amazing and surprising - different planets, places in the universe, the artists coped with this task 100%!

The graphics are at an excellent level, only in some places it sank.

We have reached the action scenes. The whole movie is one big action scene, the fights don't stop for a second, and the way Thanos uses the glove's capabilities is amazing!

The soundtrack of the movie is memorable and you will definitely want to add a couple of tracks to your playlist after watching it. Alan Silvestri coped with his task.

There is not much humor in the film, but it takes you by surprise and you just explode with laughter sometimes.

One of the best Marvel films and will definitely enter the top 50 films in history.",9
One of the best films of 2018.,27 December 2018,"The film develops so well its plot that at any moment of it feels some moment of filling, has good moments of action, suspense and comedy, even for some people the film is cut short although it lasts about 2 hours and 30 minutes.",
Easy to get caught.,3 December 2018,"Like every superhero movie, you get into it, at the first second. It is also oversaturated of action scenes without any sense. Is not a bad movie, but not even close to be the best.",6
Great movie,1 July 2022,"My favorite Avengers movie! Avengers:Infinity war is one of those rare spectacle that is heart moving and also heart breaking while still managing to fan service the mcu fans. For me the reasons why I enjoyed infinity war more than endgame are the twist and the ending. Honestly not everybody expected almost all of our beloved heroes dying so helplessly and the end scene where tanos just smiles and looks around with pride and with the sense of great achievement and that awesome emotional music, it is to me the best ending in the mcu simply because it was unprecedented.",9
Overrated garbage,5 February 2019,"From around 50 movies of 2018 this is the movie that made me agry watching. Probably because Ive seen Seven Samurai, Lord of the Rings, Mad Max etc and I cant agree that the level of action movies should fall in this level. From start to finish cgi was the only good aspect of this movies. Those who like it are probably teens. There was a critic who said this movie puts the Hollywood in danger and he is right. Critics gave this an average of 6.8 in Metascore, though it doesnt even deserve that.",6
Bang boom bang for the simple minded...,30 April 2018,"Will any 14 year old Marvelfan will love this flick? OF COURSE! Will any real moviefan will hate this flick? OF COURSE!

A rating round 9 at IMDB for this brainless effects-overkill is a hit in the face to movie histoty!",4
THE Movie... must see,29 April 2018,"Wow. I can't even. This movie is a masterpiece. It's an unbelievable culmination of the amazing 10 years that has been the MCU. It's an epic, entertaining spectacle with tons of great one-liners and epic action sequences, but at its core it's a very emotionally driven film that is gut wrenching to watch unfold.

First off, huge props to the Russo brothers for directing this thing. I can't even imagine the sheer size and task of directing this movie. Yet they pull it off to near perfection. It's a masterfully directed film. So many A-listers and characters and yet they merge all of the storylines together and find ways to get each character they're moments.

Now the movie may be titled as an avengers movie but this movie is essentially about the villain, Thanos. Yet Thanos is not an ordinary villain. He is an intriguing and intelligent character with a true motive. Josh Brolin gives the standout performance of the movie (which given the level of acting talent in this film is very impressive) His performance was great. I felt legitimate fear whenever thanos was on screen.

This movie was everything I wanted and more. It delivered to all the hype. And it set up a possibly even better and more epic sequel. This movie was so good it made me forget I was watching a movie and the intrigue and emotion I felt was real and genuine. I'm going to go as far to say that it's not just the best avengers movie, not just the best marvel movie but one of the greatest movies ever made. Wow, what an accomplishment.",10
Thanos FTW!,4 July 2020,"Who doesn't love an EPIC villain?! With huge production values this was an awesome display of VFX and an epic saga of galactic proportions. The only thing plotwise is that it's totally implausible that a being with Thanos' capabilities would suffer any attack from our protags. In ""reality"" they would've been banished to oblivion long before he acquired his final gems, though I suppose he needed a few of the superheroes in his quest for the gems. I'm stoked to see how ""Endgame"" ties it all up, though I fully expect Thanos to prevail, I'll be supremely PO'ed if the producers sell us the standard Earth-heroes-must-win Hollywood ending.",8
The best Marvel film,15 September 2021,"Gripping plot, well-crafted characters, beautiful visuals. My personal favorite Marvel film with far less cliche's than others.",9
Marvel masterpiece.,1 March 2020,"This has to be the best Avengers film. I love them all, but the ending of this one leaves you on edge which I LOVE!",10

Lot of stuff!!!!,18 August 2018,"The russo brothers did a good job on managing a huge number of charecters,movie was entertaining as hell ..what they did with thanos was great but i would have love to see thanos a bit more horrific by nature and looks(the purple guy from age of ultron credit scene) with that intense character ,after all he is thanos!!anyone except ebony maw from the black order didn't looked promising. The ending was tragic but still amazing ...overall it was a great movie to watch speacially at big screen.",8
Spare us the humor,28 April 2018,"...if only whoever wrote the script had a better sense of humor. Speaking of which, it is perfectly okay if the humor is a little much as long as it carries a certain wit about it, instead of sounding forced and cosmetic and just downright tasteless.

I will not say anything good about the film because personally, the humor made me cringe and it took most of the fun away.",6
I sort of liked it ?,4 May 2018,,2
Another win for the saga,19 November 2023,"Avengers: Infinity War is a monumental cinematic achievement that defies expectations and sets a new standard for superhero storytelling. Directed by the Russo brothers, this Marvel masterpiece is a grand, intergalactic opera that seamlessly weaves together a vast ensemble of characters and narratives into a tapestry of epic proportions.

At its core, the film is a testament to the meticulous world-building and character development that the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) has undergone over the years. The Russo brothers skillfully navigate the intricate web of storylines, giving each hero their moment while maintaining a cohesive and engaging narrative. The result is a symphony of action, emotion, and stakes that have never been higher.

The villain, Thanos, portrayed with gravitas by Josh Brolin, stands out as one of the most compelling antagonists in cinematic history. His quest to obtain the all-powerful Infinity Stones is not just a plot device but a character-driven journey that adds depth to the overarching narrative. Thanos is more than a conventional villain; he's a force of nature, a tragic figure with a twisted sense of purpose that challenges the very essence of heroism.

The film's visual spectacle is awe-inspiring. From the bustling streets of Wakanda to the distant reaches of outer space, the cinematography by Trent Opaloch captures the grandiosity and scale of the Marvel universe. The action sequences are breathtaking, with each hero bringing their unique powers to the forefront in a dazzling display of choreography and special effects.

Infinity War is not just about spectacle; it's about emotional resonance. The film doesn't shy away from exploring themes of sacrifice, loss, and the weight of responsibility. It's a rollercoaster of emotions, defying the notion that superhero films are devoid of genuine human drama.

Alan Silvestri's score enhances the emotional beats of the film, punctuating key moments with a musicality that elevates the storytelling. The soundtrack becomes a character in itself, guiding the audience through the highs and lows of the narrative.

The film's ending is a bold narrative choice that subverts traditional expectations. It leaves audiences in shock, eagerly anticipating the next installment while pondering the consequences of the Avengers' greatest challenge. Infinity War is not just a film; it's an event that has left an indelible mark on popular culture, setting the stage for a cinematic experience that transcends the boundaries of the superhero genre.

In summary, this is a cinematic triumph that seamlessly blends action, emotion, and character development on an unprecedented scale. It's a testament to the storytelling prowess of the MCU and a thrilling ride that leaves audiences on the edge of their seats, eagerly anticipating the epic conclusion in Avengers: Endgame.",10
Maybe the best Avengers movie,29 March 2021,I'm not sure if it's better than Endgame but this film is amazing. Drax and Mantis are hilarious and I love seeing the development of Wanda and Visions relationship in this film. Tony and Peter are the best duo without a doubt and Wakanda's entrance to this movie was flawless. You can really hear the pain in Thor and feel his loss. Rocket and Groot are also great in this movie. Peter's love for Gamora is also really shown in this movie making it one of the more romantic films of the MCU. This film sets up Endgame perfectly and it is great the whole way through.,10
Rating: A-,15 August 2018,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)

My most anticipated movie of 2018 was released a few months ago but at the time I was super busy, so I only had the opportunity to write a mini-review. Now, with Ant-Man and the Wasp coming out this week, I am writing full reviews of the 2015 Ant-Man as well as this monumental film, which features a lot of our favorite superheroes. I didn't watch a single clip or trailer for Infinity War, but my expectations were as high as ever. I went into the theater expecting to (finally) get a movie to rival with The Dark Knight for the best superhero film of all-time ...

Unfortunately, I didn't get it. I will get my two issues out of the way now so I can focus on the positives because this movie has a lot of them. Being this a spoiler-free review, I can't get in-depth about its ending, so I'll do it like this. While its concept is incredibly daring and its execution seamless, the emotional impact is significantly reduced by my knowledge of the MCU's future. Everyone knows which films are being developed for Phase 4, myself included, so I can't just ignore what I know. In the same way that I consider every single movie leading up to Infinity War, I also consider the future releases, especially since this is a two-part film with an overarching story.

My other problem is its balance of characters and storylines. First of all, I cannot imagine the colossal task of having to put together so many characters like the Russo brothers did. This is probably the one issue I was expecting this movie to have because I think it is impossible to perfectly balance this many groups of characters, where protagonists of their own sagas are left to secondary roles. While I do think that they mixed the characters beautifully, sometimes it felt that the film was just going from scene to scene without a real flow.

There are a lot of heroes who have to be introduced and teamed up with other ones. Even with 156 minutes of runtime, it feels that they needed more time. The first half of the movie is a bit convoluted since basically, the transitions from scene to scene become repetitive and action-heavy, with no time to breathe. Sometimes it works (the opening scene is jaw-dropping), sometimes it doesn't. These are my only issues with an otherwise outstanding movie, I enjoyed every second of it!

Like I said above, the Russo brothers brilliantly combined characters with one another having in mind the tone of each individual saga. Every actor and actress bring their A-game, everyone's script is excellently well-written. If I had to choose, my standouts are Chris Hemsworth as Thor, Elizabeth Olsen as Scarlet Witch, Zoe Saldana as Gamora and, saving the best for last, Josh Brolin as Thanos. Oh my God, Thanos ...

Undoubtedly, the star of the film. I never expected that Thanos would have as much screentime as he did, especially when it comes to his backstory. This is the best Marvel villain yet! Even though he is a total maniac, I understand where he is coming from and his motivations are actually plausible. His story is so well-told that I almost wish that he succeeds in his mission ... How crazy is that?!

When someone says ""CGI villain"", everyone instantly associates that to a horrible and depthless character. Well, Thanos is the exception to the rule because not only the CGI is mind-blowing, his characterization is amazing. Every single second that he is on-screen, I can feel it. His menacing and powerful presence is indescribable in words, you have to see it to believe it. I repeat: best Marvel villain to date!

The action is one of the best in the MCU. The fact that this was the first movie in the history of cinema to ever be entirely shot with IMAX cameras definitely elevates every single set piece. Every sequence feels astonishingly epic and the Russo brothers are part of a very small group of directors who can seamlessly handle shaky-cam. Even in the first half, there are so many entertaining action scenes, cleverly filmed and with fantastic visual effects.

Nevertheless, the big spectacle is saved for the third act where everything feels like I am watching those last epic battles in The Lord of the Rings franchise. Winter Soldier and Civil War might have better choreography and longer takes of action, but when it comes to the enormous and boundless sequences, Infinity War brings it home with bone-chilling charges on armies and exciting epicness levels. Also, the score is sensational and it definitely helps to raise a few goosebumps both in the emotional and action moments.

It is hard to rank it inside the MCU and even harder to do it inside the superhero genre. I do not have the ability or knowledge to do it know. However, it is a ground-breaking and unique film, for sure. There is no other movie with such high stakes as this. Don't get me wrong, even though this film is dark and tragic, the Marvel humor is as funny as ever. In such an action-heavy flick, having the sometimes exaggerated Marvel comedy is a breath of relief and if there is a movie that needs it, is this one.

Congrats to the Russo brothers! I never imagined the day where I could experience a film with so many superheroes, let alone such a magnificent one. Avengers: Infinity War is a ground-breaking movie in the genre, it has some of the most epic superhero action I have ever witnessed and one of the best villains of the genre's history, Thanos. This had everything to be an A+ but some issues with its ending and with the overall balance of characters and their storylines bring it down a bit. Still, it is undoubtedly one of the best superhero films ever and I can't wait to watch again!",8
The best MCU Movie,2 May 2021,"This is the best MCU movie I've ever watch. A great story, a lot of intense action with a powerful villain, a great CGI, I loved it. This movie was better than any other MCU movies, even Avengers Endgame. I really hope that the Russo brothers will return to direct other MCU Movies again.",10
It's better than endgame.,24 May 2021,"It's better than endgame. This is very nice movie. I enjoyed it, and sorry for endgame.",9
Best Marvel movie ever!!!,29 April 2018,,10
Definitely not top 25,8 May 2018,"There are a lot of movies that are rated worse than this one that are clearly better: inception, lord of the rings, matrix, usual suspects, and the list could go on. I know I'm not the first to say this as many people have stated this in reviews before. Although, I really liked this movie and thought this movie was an 8, the ratings need go down.",
Like too many marvel crossovers...,2 May 2018,This movie is a lot of fun and it has great moments. It is a delight to see the crossover of Guardians of the Galaxy and Avengers meet to battle the veiled villain of the last decade in the Marvel Universe. But IMO: Thanos is not the greatest villain in the Marvel Universe. His motivation is not that awesome - and in a way - by making the universe hang in the balance the film raised the stakes so high it was difficult to really care or believe. There is no real drama at the end because like any comic book...the character's will return. However - the fights are great fun. So - like any great crossover...it was big and loud but not as good as a single edition adventure.,7
A little better than endgame,12 May 2019,This movie is a masterpiece and if you haven't seen it you are missing out on so much,10

"'Infinite War' is not just a film, it is a cinematic event. More than an adventure or action film, like most of its predecessors, the film has a much greater sense of urgency!",22 March 2020,"A decade after the debut of 'Iron Man', Marvel finally reaches its peak, concluding three phases that brought the great heroes of Casa das Ideias to the screen, who knew how to make the necessary adaptations while maintaining the essence of the original material of the comics. In this decade of huge successes, the audience became intimate with Captain America, Iron Man, Hulk, Ant-Man, Thor, Black Panther, the Guardians of the Galaxy, in short, the whole range of characters that today make part of everyone's life. And there are characters to come before the end of phase 3 in 'Ultimatum'. The cinema knew how to popularize and expand exponentially all these characters already so familiar to fans of comics. With each new phase, new characters and universes are added to this formula, consequently leaving everything bigger, better and grander.

With the contracts about to expire and having to increasingly pay stratospheric salaries to their stars, it is natural that this phase closure is the end of the cycle for some, while other characters will continue to emerge for years to come. To command this last film, which will be divided into two parts, the Russo brothers were called, who directed highly praised films by Captain America, The Winter Soldier and Civil War, which is also an Avengers for having brought together several Super heroes. For the script, Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely were called again, who had the complex mission of bringing together earthly and cosmic characters in an organic and convincing way, placing the heroes in the face of a devastating threat. In Avengers, Infinity War, Thanos (Josh Brolin) finally arrives on Earth, willing to collect the Infinity Stones. To face it, the Avengers need to join forces with the Guardians of the Galaxy, while dealing with disagreements among some of their members.

One of the points that we observe here is how the connection between the different films of the Marvel universe is made with extreme mastery. All loose ends are tied and we can see the consequences of the events of previous films, since the split of the heroes in 'Civil War' (after the events we noticed that Tony Stark and Steven Rogers had broken off since then), Bucky Barnes' exile (Sebastian Stan) in Wakanda and how the heroes have followed separate paths since then. Captain America (Chris Evans), the Falcon (Anthony Mackie) and the Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) went to one side as fugitives, the Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) and Vision (Paul Bettany) started a relationship, the Hulk had stayed the recent years in another galaxy, as seen in 'Thor, Ragnarok', the Guardians of the Galaxy continued their space adventures, now with Mantis (Pom Klementieff - featured in 'Guardians 2') integrated once and for all with Peter Quill ( Chris Pratt) having, finally, relating with Gamora (Zoe Saldana). We see Spider-Man (Tom Holland) continuing his student life with his newfound powers joining in the cosmic battle with the group, officially becoming an Avenger. We also see characters from the Black Panther universe, presented a few months before to the public, with Wakanda being the stage of an extensive and important sequence.

'Infinite War', like the infinite itself, has no beginning and no end, starting in the midst of the action directly connected with Thor, Ragnarok in which we have an exact notion of the size of the threat faced. If in small appearances in previous films, Thanos failed to show everything he was capable of, here he arrives showing what he came for. In ten minutes of film, the Titan beats Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) mercilessly and without mercy, decimates Asgardians and ends Loki (Tom Hiddlestone) and Thor (Chris Hemsworth) without making the slightest effort. This is the point at which, we buy the seriousness of the situation and the grandeur and seriousness of the villain.

From there, as never before, the universe is fully explored as we follow the villain in search of the Jewels of Infinity across the galaxy. Thor's encounter with the Guardians of the Galaxy and the split of the group in two, with Thor, Rocket and the teenager Groot going to Nidavellir, where Eitri, the dwarf (Peter Dinklage) would manage to make a new hammer for Thor, with which he he could defeat Thanos and the others by going to Knowhere, where The Collector (Benício Del Toro) keeps the Jewel of Reality. Having already had the Jewel of Power, obtained when Thanos wiped out Xandar, he would become even stronger. Meanwhile, the other heroes stay on Earth to face Thanos' allies, who desperately try to obtain the Jewels of Time (which is protected by Doctor Strange) and Mind (which is part of the Vision).

This beginning of the conclusion of phase 3 of the Marvel universe expands the action to several places on Earth (New York - where Thanos' followers go after the Jewel that is with Doctor Strange, Scotland and Wakanda - to obtain the Jewel of the Mind). In addition, in space we travel to Gamora's home planet wiped out by Thanos, to Knowhere - where The Collector, Titan lives - Thanos' planet, Vormir - where the Soul Jewel was, where only Gamora knew her whereabouts, Nidavellir - dwarf planet forging the most deadly weapons in the galaxy.

In 'Infinite War', we have the feeling that there is really a powerful and practically unbeatable threat that puts humanity and the entire galaxy at risk, to the point of being wiped out in a snap. The film carries an air of despair and hopelessness. What we see on the screen are characters fighting side by side and trying to improvise in the face of a threat far greater than the sum of their powers. The battle still carries the airs of altruism and strength of the previous films, but this time, we have moved far from that feeling that everything is under control and will be resolved in some heroic and inventive way. The writers rightly chose to leave the villainous titan Thanos at the center of the story. The film carried by the antagonist's unexpected charisma, which has contextualized motivations, and fits perfectly into the presented universe - he is cruel, merciful, has a sense of humor and is kind. Here, his relationship with his ""adopted daughters"" can finally be properly explored. In this respect, many applause for Josh Brolin's performance combined with the incredible visual effects that created the figure of the Crazy Titan

With an established enemy, the directors' competence shown in 'Civil War' in reconciling so many heroes on the scene, is repeated here, on a much larger scale. With so many heroes on the scene, it was possible to notice even more the relationship between them. Thor's dynamic with the Guardians of the Galaxy is excellent, especially with Rocket (voice of Bradley Cooper). We even have some scenes of the God of Thunder with his half brother Loki, who once again reinforces the love-hate relationship between the brothers. We also have the hilarious relationship between Spider-Man and Iron Man, again repeating the partnership in some hilarious scenes. The duo still has great chemistry with Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch). Captain America's team also had a fearless resistance with the Royal Guard, the Frontier Tribe, the Dora Milaje and the Winter Soldier, Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan). Whether across the galaxy or on Earth, the groups formed to defend humanity from Thanos' imposing threat. The whole cast is great and the excitement of each one to be part of these experiences is notorious.

Contrary to what we saw in the past, by the way, you can say that Infinite War is the darkest film in the Marvel shared universe. This is not only due to the aforementioned sense of hopelessness, the result of the notion that, at that time, the heroes really are dealing with a threat far greater than the strength of their powers, but also because of the decrease in the tone of jokes and comic reliefs. . Not only the public, but the heroes themselves know that what they face now is far greater than any enemy they have faced before.

There are no words to describe the magnificent visual effects, which are further magnified on the big screen of the cinema. The action scenes on practically all planets and scenarios bring out the best to be explored in each situation. The joining of so many worlds, in so many contexts and how everything is so integrated was certainly an arduous task, but performed to perfection. The varied photography of Trent Opaloch combined with the production designer of Charles Wood and the soundtrack of Alan Silvestri places the viewer in the most diverse environments and brings all the dramatic and spectacular load to the viewer.

It is the feeling of integration of the entire Marvel universe materializing in a way that it is impossible not to please the public. Infinite War is not just a film, it is a cinematic event, one of those films that are practically unanimous and that manage to go down in history, due to the quality, repercussions and records achieved successively. More than an adventure or action film, like most of its predecessors, the film has a much greater sense of urgency. The Russo brothers made a megalomaniac work, with unforgettable scenes of action (with special emphasis on the action scenes that take place in Titan and Wakanda) and with dilemmas of friendship and family that are fully supported. This is the long-awaited show since 'The Lord of the Rings, The Return of the King (2003)', something so spectacular and well built at the same time.",9

Blockbuster!👌🏻💯,19 March 2023,"Absolutely entertaining. Great story and screenplay. The fights and action scenes were just amazing. Iron Man's (Robert Downey Jr) suit-up in a fight scene was super-cool. Captain America's (Chris Evans) entry was awesome. But guess what?? Thor (Chris Hemsworth) was the real MVP of this movie. Coming to the main antagonist, Thanos (Josh Brolin) nailed it with his chilling dialogues and energetic performance. The climax was jaw-dropping. I am giving 10 out of 10 stars for this movie because for me, it is the best Avengers movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Keep it up, Marvel Studios. Hats off! 👏🏻🔥",10

TOP MARVEL MOVIE!!,28 May 2023,"For a while, I thought no Marvel movie would get a 10/10 from me. But after reviewing this movie, I'm glad to say I was wrong. This movie really is an achievement in the comic book movie genre. I thoroughly enjoyed every moment of this film, and I thought, unlike a lot of other Marvel projects, that the humor was well done. Civil War was number 1, but I feel good saying it's second place to this great movie.

I really appreciated how the directors and studio had the guts to actually have the villain win. Thanos is such a complex, compelling villain and while we should hate him, we understand what he's doing and why he's doing it. Therefore, it makes for an interesting scenario in which we wouldn't mind if the villain actually comes out victorious.

Overall, I really enjoyed this movie from beginning to end, and I'm grateful for this one considering a lot of the MCU is very mediocre.",10

Just okay,30 April 2018,"I guess I didn't really know what to expect from Infinity War but like everyone else I was stoked to see it. I must be getting tired of the Marvel Universe because I thought this movie was very mediocre. I didn't get what they were trying to do with Thanos and the kind of ridiculous ending. After the extra post credit stuff I kind of left the theater with an ""Do I really care anymore."" I kind of got the feeling that the rest of the silent audience were either confused, stunned or didn't care either.",6
The pinnacle of Marvel,15 June 2022,"This is a 10/10 purely because Thanos is so compelling to watch as a villian. The huge number of cameos and interactions between all the different heroes also make this film great.

I felt like the action dragged on a bit at the end, but this is in basically every marvel film, and the ending was so good that it makes up for it.",10
More entertaining than Black Panther but far from great.,28 April 2018,"My concerns about the balance and cohesion between the cast and the settings prior to seeing the movie were real. Infinity War is four distinct movies stitched together. The different groups do not interact, let alone coordinate with each other, and the conflict should not be called a war but a series of amazing stories.

Each scene change requires the audience to not only readjust their mood and expectation, but also the level of engagement. The films jumps back and forth between melodramas, epic fighting and irrelevant humors which feel awkward and disjoint. While viewers should not expect physical realism or common sense in a comic-book movie, some is still required to convince us to suspend our disbelieve.

The best part of Infinity War is the mighty Thanos himself, who bears the brunt of narrative depth and character development. He seems to be such a nice guy, who tried his damnest to not hurt our fragile heroes, and a diligent achiever that I wish I could buy him a beer and watch the sunset together. The semi-destruction of the universe is a hard day's work after all. Mission accomplished.",6

Dark Marvel/Disney? I LOVED IT!,17 August 2018,"This is INSANE. This movie is fantastic. After 18 movies, the Directors/writers had to make a decision:

Either write the movie for the critics: Making clear mini arcs for all the characters (which would've been stupid and impossible), plus a theme, plus ""time for the movie to rest, quiet moments"" blah blah blah.

Or write the movie that the MCU deserved. Taking advantage of all the stories, baggage, and great characters the other movies already created and presented.

Thank God the Russo brothers/Marvel decided correctly.",10

Masterpiece,17 April 2023,"Without any doubt, Avengers: Infinity War is the greatest crossover movie of all time and to date Marvel's best project. Great acting and absolutely brilliant plot that starts with first Iron Man movie deliver tremendous experience in two and a half hours. All of the action sequences are great, most of the characters get enough time on screen and hype hasn't gone since the first trailer. From the moment I hear Nick Fury's voice ""there was an idea..."" or phrase ""dread it"" I get goosebumps. Nothing before and sure as hell nothing after Infinity War, including Endgame, comes near this masterpiece. It was an honor to rush to the cinema and watch IW as well as watching it more than ten times after premiere.",10
Utterly Amazing.,29 April 2018,"So here it is, Avengers: Infinity War. After 10 years of waiting, or 6 if you count from his first appearance in Avengers Assemble, Thanos has finally arrived. All I can say is that the wait was worth it.

Firstly, the story lines are extremely well balanced. I could not imagine the difficulty of the task attempting to fit enough screen time for the likes of Thor, Star Lord and Iron Man into a singular film, however, the Russo brothers have managed to do so. They also managed to combine the 'right' characters in order to play off of one another. The snidey in love with themselves combination of Dr Strange and Tony Stark, to the humor and whit of Thor and the Guardians of the Galaxy. They all blended and worked so well together.

Secondly the CGI is quite possibly the best I have ever witnessed. Josh Brolins portrayal of Thanos shines through in so many way, not just his dark and gritty vocal work, but also the ability to show every single facial movement. Outstanding work from the graphics department for that one,

Thirdly, the tone set from the beginning of the film. It immediately shows the power and devastation Thanos is capable of, and the audience never feel a sense of safety for any of the heroes again.

Finally, and least surprising, is the action sequences. These action scenes have you on the edge of your seat from the get go. The heroes working with one another to try and take down Thanos and his 'lackeys' is some of the most compelling sequences I have ever witnessed. All of this action followed by a breathtaking soundtrack from Alan Silvestri.

The only negative thing I can say about the movie is that it is going to cost me a lot of money going to re-watch it time and time again.

Well done the Russo Brothers.",10
Liked it much more than Endgame,15 July 2021,,8
Marvel Cinematic Universe Marathon 2019 #20,20 December 2021,"DREAD IT. RUN FROM IT. DESTINY STILL ARRIVES ALL THE SAME.

Avengers: Infinity War is a mind-boggling superhero film with exceptional cast and psychedelic CGI effects that alter our brain cells. The Russo Brothers are one of a kind imaginative storytellers that pour emotional depth in each character with adequate poignant strength.

#ThanosDidNothingWrong.",9
Perfectly balanced,27 April 2018,"Thanos(Brolin, giving us a layered villain, the best in recent years) has...*finally*... started to gather the Infinity Gems. If he gets all six he can wipe out half of the universe with a snap of his fingers. Will our heroes be able to stop him and his ""Children""?

The hype for this was unreal. Many say that it couldn't live up to it. And I realise that a lot don't, and won't(as it premieres around the world), think it did. For my money(and they'll keep getting them as long as they keep making them this good), it delivered, and then some. Obviously, with so many major characters, they cannot possibly all get a lot of screentime. You could criticise their decision to include so many. Honestly, you're free to think so, but this is not a movie for you. Which is fine. I don't doubt that you love flicks that aren't for me. This is a cinematic version of an event comic, not decreased in scope as most of the adaptations of those stories are, something I've been waiting for for 20 years to be done right. So rather than complain about something that couldn't be helped, let's look at whether it's satisfying. Personally, I absolutely think so. I've loved most of these since I first saw these versions of them, and I felt that they were all featured to the right extent. Every single one of them makes an impact, most get arcs, not a single one feels like they're just in the background(as is the case with every single X-Men film).

This wastes no time starting the plot, moves quickly, and introduces us to all the groups quite early on, and yet never feels overpowering. I realised the following is an old example, however, recently rewatching Revenge of the Sith, the difference is incredible. Both were built up to for years(at least 6 in both cases), and where that one is massively overcrowded, and quite tiring and tedious, this one isn't, even a little. I know. I can hardly believe it myself. It delivers on emotion, interaction between individuals, growth, in addition to action scenes(which, ultimately, is the bread and butter of a Summer blockbuster). Does it, outside of the bad guy's depiction, including personality and motivation, reach a level of depth akin to the solo adventures? No. It would be unrealistic to expect it to. It's not going for that. Finally, there has been a lot of reasonable concern, for how they would handle the supposed killing off of fan favorites. I'm not giving away whether or not they do, or if it's only for bit parts. What I will say is that everyone who kicks the bucket in this, on either side of the conflict, gets to be memorable and important before they do. They were very smart and how they handled that. Like everything else in this.

I recommend this to anyone who finds it to be appealing. Do note that the ending is very much a setup for the next one, and doesn't feel conclusive. It used to be called part 1 for a reason. And yes, that will disappoint many - and they're not wrong. Personally, I'm just incredibly excited for Avengers 4. 10/10",10
Loved it.,15 March 2022,"Worth to watch. Enjoyed most. One of the best directed and one of the best from Marvel Cinematic Universe. Personally liked the 3-4 characters from this movie.

The characters are just not the person for fans, they played role of their own from the bottom of their heart.

The film is driven by the compelling presence of Thanos, a complex villain who seeks to wipe out half of the universe's population. The film balances humor, action, and emotion, and delivers some shocking twists and turns. The film also sets up the stakes for the next Avengers film, leaving the audience in suspense and anticipation. Avengers: Infinity War is a must-see for Marvel fans and anyone who enjoys epic storytelling.",8
The best at everything: but do previous MCU & avoid spoilers,21 December 2023,"--- No spoilers or even plot-outline here. If at all possible, try to avoid such things before watching this for the first time. ---

A super-rare 10/10...only the 12th film to bag this rating (from over a thousand movies rated).

An Epic achievement, nonstop thrill-a-minute rollercoaster ride for 150 minutes where even the quiet passages excite the senses. Not a single weak moment. Plot, cast, antagonist, dialogue, pace, music, action, camera, editing, FX, 3D, humour, drama, thrills...it all worked beautifully. It is the best at all these things from all the MCU movies so far (ok, Guardians beats it on humour but the few moments of levity in IW are welcome & powerful).

The only caveat for its ranking among the very greatest movies is that to get the most out of it you really need to watch the previous 18 movies of the MCU. That build-up, all those character developments and pre-knowledge of lore is crucial.

And I should know, as I first watched Infinity War last year without any of this, without any Marvel knowledge at all. Enjoyed it, well-made. But without that connection it was an 8/10 max. Not breaking my Top 100. It was thereafter checking out Guardians of the Galaxy (specifically Gamora's character and her connection to the saga) that made me ponder how a rewatch of Infinity War might be if I did all the MCU in order. It was also a recent purchase of the Meta Quest 3, and how 3D-movies look in that FOV-filling isolated screen, that persuaded me to do it. And yes, they look very impressive that way.

Now done. Those first 18 movies are good-to-great (except Hulk, haha), and on to Infinity War. It's absolutely incredible! Utterly gripped, mesmerised...despite having seen it before. But now I'm armed with all that build-up. Deserves its place up there with the very best cinema has offered us these last 100 years. And the greatest action sci-fi/fantasy flick since Empire Strikes Back.

It's a hard sell to persuade film fans who aren't into superhero movies to watch 18 of them just so that they can optimally experience the greatest of them.

But honestly now that I've done it I have to disagree with Scorsese: MCU, specifically The Infinity Saga, is absolutely cinema.",10
Pure entertainment from the start,20 December 2019,"This for me is the best of all the Avengers movies. What makes it is the character of Thanos, he is not an out an out bad guy but somebody who sees what hes doing is for the good of the universe. Added to this is that he has strong feelings and compassion. End game just doesn't have this aspect. I think the ratings for this is right, for me the plot has a few flaws and some CGI is a little off but that's it, so close for a 10 for me. But unlike some great films you can watch this one a few times.",9

Inconsistent action movie,15 September 2018,"So this is the quintisential super hero movie. A bit of comedy, but not too much, and not enough to make the movie funny, a bit of plot but it is all over the place and mostly made out of plot holes and idiocy, and lots and lots of action for action sake, all leading nowhere in the end.

There is some hope a follow up movie can make this part of greater arch, but as it stands on its own, it is just too inconsistent to give you that punch in the gut it was trying to set you up for.",6
Incomprehensible Unless You're a Fan,2 May 2018,"A movie should stand on its own two feet as an entertainment experience. You shouldn't have to watch 18 other movies first in order to enjoy a film. Unfortunately, to enjoy Avengers: Infinity War, you really have to have seen all the other MCU films or this film doesn't really make any sense. Hell, they rarely even introduce characters by name, let alone give you any clue as to who these people are. It really takes shalllowness to a whole new level of yawn-inducing ennui.

It's not like I haven't seen any other Marvel superhero movies; I've seen several. When I was a kid, I read the comic books. And I still had no clue who most of the characters in this movie were! And I certainly didn't give two hoots whether they lived or died.

The film is a spectacular, eye-popping kaleidoscope of sumptuous costumes, special effects, and MONEY spent lavishly on just about everything. The salaries for the all-star cast alone must have sucked up a huge portion of the film's budget. But who cares? If you weren't already invested in the characters, you aren't going to become invested in this sea of nameless wisecrackers spewing rather clever (but pointless) dialogue endlessly.

I couldn't make it to the end, I walked out about halfway through. I hear the end is the best part but I couldn't summon enough interest to care. They lost me with the meaningless major death early in the picture. Snore! I don't go to a film to see favorite characters bite the dust! Especially since they'll just have to resurrect people so they can make their various contracted sequels in their own franchises. This film is an expensive waste of time unless you're a rabid fan.

It's all about the story, man! Without a good story and some time spent up front getting you invested in the main characters, a movie is nothing. Black Panther was terrific because it had a terrific script but this film sucked rocks because its script was a shallow, mediocre snooze despite the witty repartee. Don't bother unless you're a big fan of the MCU.",2

Even the picture from the screensaver on the poster is not a screenshot - one of the heroes was not in that location. Third, this is an unconventional, let's say, ending. And so, in principle, it's still the same cheerful Marvel, with a bunch of superheroes, battle scenes, jokes and jokes. By the way, I would like to say separately about the Black Panther. Everyone was scolding the Russian dubbing, but in the original his voice is just as dull, plus all the Wakandans speak with a terrible African accent - it all sounds terrible, it's good that a little. In theory, Infinity War should bypass the State of emergency in fees and become the highest-grossing film in history. Until the release of the second part, at least.",9

Captain America - why?,19 January 2022,"There will be those who will insist that this is the most anticipated movie of recent years. Otherwise, why then for spoilers could be beaten and even beaten. Such hype can be found not so often. But tell me, was it worth it?..

Some surviving superheroes are trying to do something, but they just don't see any way out. This happens until Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) arrives right at the Avengers headquarters, offering a new idea that can really work.

Surprisingly, there is nothing much to say about the plot of the three-hour picture. There is no integral narrative structure. The action breaks up into several parts. Firstly, it is the wandering of small groups of characters, whose interaction is filled with humor (both successful and not so much). Secondly, it is an almost incessant action, which in this context is a plus. However, the problem is that these parts do not fit together well enough.

Watching what is happening, the thought involuntarily comes that this is a simple fan fiction written by a fan of the Marvel universe on the topic of what would have happened if the story had gone differently. There is no well-thought-out plot, because of the abundance of heroes, almost no one gets to pay due attention, and to top it all off, the question arises: why does such an unsightly hero inherit the title of Captain America?",8
Movie of the Decade,4 September 2019,"The build up of this movie to get to where it is at during it's time of release is just insane. From the 1st Iron Man Movie and all the following movies after such as Captain America, Spider-man home coming, Thor, and Avengers Infinity War to name a few. It took about 22 movies (I could be wrong) to get to this final one, the end of all end, to where a new phase will begin. It's insane but how they did, the way the did it, is just superb, not perfect, but better than most.

Infinity War - EPIC,24 November 2023,"Contrary to my rating of 10/10 I do not think this movie is perfect. But what it does well, it does so, so well that the minor shortcomings are easily passed over.

Firstly, the antagonists' character is built very well. His past, his story, his voice and his philosophies are so good and more importantly controversial, but somehow understandable. This is what makes him scary. Best MCU villain so far and I don't think they can do better than this.

Acting all across the board is good. The elite team joining up is utterly monumental, giving the audience literal goosebumps. Plot is thrilling and absorbing. The film score is rousing in the right moments and downcast in the right moments. Action and fight sequences are shot well. Overall CGI is done with quality. I found the climax absolutely perfect.

Avengers: Infinity War - 9.9/10,6 June 2024,"1. Overall Plot - 10/10 This movie is so good. It is what the entire MCU has been leading too. I do kind of wish we got to see all of the Avengers together, but them also being split up is cool. It is actually really cool to be changing between three groups throughout the movie. We see Iron Man and Spider-Man, The Guardians of the Galaxy and Thor, and Captain America, and the Avengers. Watching as their stories all come together against Thanos is super cool.

It is very cool to finally see Thanos as the villain. And watching him execute his plan to get all the Infinity Stones is so entertaining.

2. Entertainment / Engagement - 10/10 This movie is just go, go, go. From start to finish it is action. And it is so entertaining to watch. Watching all these characters come together and all trying to stop Thanos is so fun.

3. Emotion / Investment in Story - 10/10 This movie is crazy. I remember watching this for the first time. It was a roller coaster of emotions. The emotional journey you as a viewer goes through is phenomenal. And it ends in a way that is just absolutely mind blowing.

4. Theme and Depth of Story - 10/10 Sacrifice is a huge theme in this. Every single hero sacrifices something in order to fight Thanos.

This movie is super deep. The way the movie ends off is so deep. It leaves you in awe.

5. Characters - 9/10 The characters are so cool in this. I love seeing Cap and his team again. Also Cap and Black Panther working together is just something I think is so cool. I love how Thor goes on his own journey to try to defeat Thanos.

There is so much good, but just a little bad. So I'm going to talk about what I don't like.

I hate how Hulk isn't even really in this movie. That is just dumb and makes no sense. Another big character design I absolutely hate is Iron Man's Nanotech suit. It is too CGI. And all it does is ruin any cool suit up scenes that we've seen throughout the MCU. The suit itself just looks ugly. I hate how they did Star-Lord. This is the movie that ruined him. He went from a super smart outlaw leader, to an idiot comic relief character. And for the most part his character stays like that now. I also don't like more than a 'friendly neighborhood Spider-Man'. It just messes with his character development so much.

With all that bad, it's still a nine out of ten. Because these are easily overlooked. And the good far out weighs the bad.

Thanos himself was also very cool. He just feels like a villain. His motive for what he is doing is very interesting. It is intriguing to see how he justifies his bad actions.

6. Acting / Writing - 10/10 All of the acting is on point. The only thing I don't like is Mark Ruffalo. But at this point I'm more used to him. He just doesn't feel like Bruce Banner at all.

7. Cinematography / Sets - 9/10 The cinematography is very cool. I love that the whole film was filmed in IMAX. There is a few shots that look particularly beautiful.

The settings in this are very cool and unique. Because of things that happen, and places they go, we see some very cool action scenes. I also love Wakanda yet again in this movie. It looks very cool, and is the perfect place to have a battle.

8. Score / Sound - 10/10 The music in this is so good. The Avengers music to the max. It It's very epic. The sound design is also amazing. I love the sound of the Infinity Stones especially. The sound so cool and powerful.

9. Editing / Pace - 10/10 Literally could not be any better. It is edited very well for switching between three different groups. And the pacing is amazing. I love how long the climax is. It feels like it is almost the whole movie. Just when you thing it might slow down, it picks back up again.

10. VFX/Practical Effects - 9/10 The effects are all great. I just feel like some things could've and have been better. They aren't bad by any means, but just could have been slightly better.

Average Score: 9.7/10

My Overall Rating and Final Thoughts: 9.9/10 This movie is such a good beginning of the end of the Infinity Saga. It is a near perfect movie, and one of the best MCU movies.",10
Awesome!,25 May 2020,,10
"When a ""fun"" experience can overshadow all other shortcomings",1 May 2018,"So this is the big one. Ten years in the making, 18 movies in a franchise leading to this. Despite the sky high expectations stemming from the popularity of its preceding films, AVENGERS INFINITY WAR delivers the wide appeal, casual friendly entertainment one has come to expect from the Marvel Cinematic Universe brand. Only that this time, Marvel studios takes it a notch higher.

AVENGERS INFINITY WAR is bigger from the get go. The scope is expanded from earth to the entire universe as the alien warlord Thanos' personally expedites his quest to retrieve the powerful infinity gems for his own ends. Gems which are closely tied to the fates of this world's greatest heroes. Through perfectly logical (within the context of the story) means and reasons, the actions of Thanos and his servants end up bringing together heroes from across all the past MCU movies.

How does the movie juggle so many characters at once? Well it does so very well. All the characters get a decent amount of time in the spotlight. Half the fun is seeing these characters that you grew to love in their respective movies come together and interact on screen; characters who merely years ago would have no reason to be interacting. Who would have imagined StarLord, whose adventures are at the far end of the cosmos, would be talking face to face with the earth based Iron Man? The cast is perfect in every way with decent chemistry even among those interacting for the very first time on screen.

The one thing i really appreciated was the more serious tone, carried on from Black Panther earlier in 2018. A pet peeve of mine has been this obsession with throwing in random quips and comedic moments into the middle of a hectic battle, a tense dialogue or a tension filled face off. This has plagued more than half of MCU movies and all it serves is to trivialise the stakes and destroy any attempt to take the movie seriously. Thankfully, the stakes here are more dire than anything ever seen in the MCU. INFINITY WAR does have witty banter, but this is kept separate from the drama; a very welcome change.

I can safely say that the movie entertains. Its energetic script and fast pace makes the long run time zoom by. There are multiple sub plots but nothing too complex if you are paying attention. The awesome action sequences are finger bitingly intense and the highlight of the entire movie. All this is set to some of composer Alan Silvestri's best musical work yet. S

I can also safely say that this movie is not perfect. As amazing as the action was, some of the fights are just overly choreographed, more like a dance than a fight. Personally, I would have preferred something more raw in the fights.

The story too comes across as a little shallow, especially compared to CAPTAIN AMERICA CIVIL WAR and BLACK PANTHER which managed to weave in some relevant sociopolitical commentary that generate discussion. INFINITY WAR touches on themes of self sacrifice, and a Machiavellian take on population control, but it never brings those themes front and centre.

Instead what is front and centre is the laughs, the action, the tears, and other simple emotional appeals. The fact that all the characters enter and leave this movie ""as they are"" rather than undergo development through the course of the narrative makes it feel like a season finale to a saturday morning cartoon. Whatever development comes about suddenly in the closing moments rather than organically as the story plays out.

On a whole, I would describe AVENGERS INFINITY WAR as this big reunion party. It sells itself on the experience rather than the story. The experience of a loyal fanbase being rewarded after 10 years of loyalty. The experience of that roller coaster ride through flash CGI graphics all ""woohoo"" and ""yea!"" and being able to enjoy it in the company of like minded individuals. It is a party more than a movie. Who cares about overly convenient events that drive the plot, who cares about unremarkable cinematography and overly hectic action sequences. Who cares about deeper themes, symbolism and narrative depth. It makes me feel awesome. Exactly like a good party.",7

And despite a dark premise there's lots of laughs along the way as well as tears. From the opening moments you know the game is real. The events are shocking and yet it's still exciting to see our favorite characters come together especially a hilarious Thor and star lord and a lovable and heartbreaking spider man. But the real goods belong to a wonderful layered Robert Downey Jr. The best thing about this film is that it leaves you wanting the next chapter desperately.

Avengers: Infinity War Is The Best MCU Movie Till Date !!!,13 March 2022,"10 years in the making, the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) comes together to take on the mighty Thanos who threatens to put an end to the universe.

Irrespective of your opinion on the superhero film genre, you cannot deny that 'Avengers: Infinity War' is an ambitious undertaking - the biggest of its kind, making it a significant event in film history. Marvel Studios took a decade to meticulously plan this mammoth showdown of all their fictional heroes together for the first time on screen. To say that the MCU has a lot riding on this would be a gross understatement, evident by their massive marketing campaign visible everywhere. But the billion-dollar question is - does it live up to the hype.

Quick answer? Oh yes, it does! All the superheroes get their moments to shine, and while some naturally take predominance over the others, no role feels minor at any point. Christopher Markus & Stephen McFeely's efforts need special mention for putting together the most crucial and challenging element in a film of this magnitude - the screenplay. From the film's opening moments, their goal to create a clear and coherent narrative is evident. The Russo Brothers take this material and enhance it to bring out some fantastic performances, along with the large-scale action one has come to expect from the MCU. Keeping this balance is not only tricky but also essential to maintain audience interest over a period of two and a half hours. There's barely a dull scene; in fact, MCU's trademark humour is intact and paired with several gut-wrenching moments that will be hard to forget once the credits roll.

In addition to the delight of seeing various characters who've never met each other rub off on one another, talk shop, and exchange banter, it's also staggering to see how much Marvel's universe has grown when it's all brought together on a single canvas. The directors and the writers deserve praise for not making Infinity War feel rushed, as it has plenty of quiet meaningful moments for its characters, especially for Vision (Paul Bettany) and Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen), Quill and Gamora, and Stark. This isn't true for most of the others, such as Cap and Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman), but that Infinity War can craft some genuine heart-breaking moments in such a massive get-together is a marvel.

Avengers: Infinity War begins where Thor: Ragnarok's post-credits stinger left off, with Thanos' ship intercepting the Asgardians. Infinity War uses Thanos as its viewpoint, as he goes after the Infinity Stones one by one. His goal is to collect all six, with which he could then wipe out half the universe with a snap of his fingers. Earth is important because two of the powerful, glowing ingots are here. One's in the care and protection of Doctor Strange, while the other is embedded in Vision's forehead, essentially keeping him alive. As they try to stop him, the film divides up the heroes: Thor ends up with the Guardians momentarily; Iron Man, Strange, and Spider-Man end up together; and the rest secure Vision in Wakanda.

The consequences of this entry on the MCU are tremendous, all due to the actions of the one single antagonist they have been building since 'The Avengers' in 2012. Josh Brolin had a high bar to meet, and his Thanos smashes all expectations with conviction. He is multi-dimensional with a looming presence to justify all his screen time. Facing him are the superheroes who will take you by surprise on multiple occasions. It's a big team effort with every actor swinging for the fences. The only drawback? All the blistering action, relentless humor and plot intersections might get overwhelming to the casual viewer. But it's all part of the plan - there's so much to digest it warrants a second viewing. If you've felt we're nearing superhero exhaustion, Marvel just went and changed the rules leaving you begging for more - proving yet again that they are the real masters of this game.",10

There's so much going on, so many characters and yet everything feels so familiar that those three hours FLY by! Definitely give this movie all of your attention, because it's absolutely gut-wrenchingly wonderful. Sure, there's things I don't agree with, but no movie is perfect lol

Many people say Infinity War is the action and Endgame is the brain and I agree totally with that, but in Endgame there are many things that can be questioned, the decisions, things that did not make sense, things that can't be explained, some rushed choices and many more. But Infinity War is perfect, it is balanced, it is well written, it is action-packed and the most important thing, it never gets boring, not for a single second. There is always something happening, something big and exciting, heart pounding and stressful. There is happiness and there is grief, there is team work and there is power. Incredible re-introduction of all the characters that we've seen throughout the MCU journey with some of the most amazing visuals and CGI effects ever seen in the movie theaters.",9

"Chris Evans was born on June 13th, 1981",21 May 2022,"The namesake movie of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), arrived in 2018. Being the 19th entry in the Infinity War saga of the MCU, It is mostly a transitional film, which helps set-up the events that happen in Antman and the Wasp (2018), Captain Marvel (2019) and Avengers: Endgame (2019). It is a pivotal film for the MCU, because the Infinity War had to happen, in order to get to the Endgame. Coming off the success of their first MCU attempts, Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014) and Captain America: Civil War (2016), the Russo brothers direct this film like it was ancient mythology. By utilizing the great stories from the comic books, they are able to give the audience a spectacular representation of an epic comic book adventure. They give to the characters in the film a super positive vibe, that tells the audience these are heroes. They are heroes to remember. Yes, it's still a fantasy, science fiction, comic book story but the Russo's give these Marvel characters the meat needed to bring them as close to reality as today's current cinema can.

The current roster of the Avengers has broken up. After the events of Civil War broke up Tony Stark (Robert Downey JR.) and Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), the team is splintered in half. Falcon (Anthony Mackie) and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) are off grid and Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen) and Vision (Paul Bettany), have run off to work on their romance. If you saw the events in Thor: Ragnarok (2017), Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and Banner (Mark Ruffalo), are together on an Asgard space ark. The main evil bad guy, who has been part of the backstory of the whole Infinity Saga, Thanos (Josh Brolin), is searching for the six Infinity stones and has caught up with the Asgardians, knowing that Thor's brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston), has one of them.

What makes this film so huge is the fact that, the Russo's had to jack up the energy they started in the Marvel ensemble film Captain America: Civil War (2016), with an even bigger ensemble cast of superheroes for this film. Everyone knew it was coming, from all the hype that was generated for the film initially. It would combine the Avengers with the Guardians of the Galaxy, along with Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) and Spider-Man (Tom Holland). Throw in all of their super-friends, that came from all of their respective movies and you have an event of epic, block-buster entertainment. Thanos is coming and he can't be stopped. It's up to the Earth's mightiest heroes to stop him. Witness this universe shattering display of MCU might. It is not a disappointment and audiences from all varieties can enjoy this film.

First movie I saw in the theater that busy year and totally worth it!!,9 June 2022,"There is a lot spoken about this film. My take is ""just go and watch it!"". Granted, this film is a very standard superhero affair. Yet, the VFX is ground-breaking and the story is engaging enough for us to care till the climax.

The array of different characters never cease to amuse us. Rather than trying to wow us with different performers and superpowers, the film has a genuine role for each characters which appear.

In terms of empowerment as well, this film scores very well. The minority characters come up with intelligent ideas scientifically in a scene which is well done and does not cloy us into dismissal.

The action is fantastic and is backed with compelling reasons for all the fighting. Overall, this is a fun-filled movie which will satisfy a big number of audience.",8
It was alright,27 April 2018,,6
Best Marvel movie,26 April 2019,"Infinity war is a high-paced masterpiece that combines so many interesting characters in a unique way.

I am truly impressed by the way the directors have brought things together and have built up the culmination for the whole MCU since 2008.

Visuals are phenomenal, funny moments are plenty. Despite the relatively smaller focus on character development, I liked that you can clearly see the motivation for the actions of each side. This brings more depth to the story and brings the viewer on a emontional ride.

Infitiy war is full of twists and suprises, and is never boring. I feel like I can watch it again and again without ever having too much of it.",10
Ok end for a sort of arc,25 April 2018,"This movie was pretty much what I expected it to be. 2 movies squeezed into one or at least a lot cut away. There were too many fast cuts to count and about halfway I was constantly wondering where are we now. A lot of action with (unnecessary)feels parts in between.

The Russo's make their draw and leave us perfectly in awe...,23 July 2019,"Much more engaging and far superior to its predecessor Avenger films...Infinity War is the movie we were all waiting for . 10 years build-up and it came down upon us, with sheer epic scale and gut-punching resolutions. It may over-entice its somewhat bloated array of storylines with somewhat unbalanced character dynamics along the way. But this is not meant to be an ordinary film. It's a Super Smash Brothers Brawl type feature and a blockbuster like no other. Reaching places visually and emotionally that this MCU franchise finally needed to take. Carried by a fabulous performance by Josh Brolin as Thanos, he makes this movie his own, as the Avengers are just there to do their best. But is their best enough. Such an epic experience. It's an event more than a film, and be sure to ready your expectations. Because the Russo's send us off with pure cinematic, shakespearean-esk illuminations. Setting up for maybe an even better Avengers sequel. But let's just hope they don't get too predictable on us. One for a generation. What an experience.",8

big,25 April 2018,"Greetings again from the darkness. We are at the 10 year mark of the new Marvel cinematic universe that began with the revolutionary IRON MAN (2008). This 19th movie in the franchise is actually Part 1 of 2 films that will (supposedly) be the lasting legacy of The Avengers. The second ""half"", much of which was filmed simultaneously with this one, is set for 2019. Co-directing brothers Anthony Russo and Joe Russo were responsible for the two most recent Captain America movies (and also one of my all-time least favorites: YOU, ME AND DUPREE), and have now taken on the biggest budget, biggest cast, and longest run time yet of any Marvel movie. In fact, it's so big, it could only be named 'Infinity'.

Being that the fan base for this movie is highly sensitive to anything resembling a hint, much less a spoiler, this review will tread very lightly, and instead function as an overview with very general observations. There are a few key points, most of which are quite obvious from either the trailers or the previous movies in the series. First thing to realize is that this is a Thanos movie. He's the first big (I told you everything was big), bad, nearly omnipotent villain. It should be noted that Thanos sees himself as misunderstood, which leads to the second key point: melodrama abounds - moreso than any previous comic book movie. It seems to be reminding us that Superheroes are people too (but are they really?). The third point is that if every character with a speaking part simply said ""I am Spartacus"", it would still likely be the longest ever comic book movie. There are at least 28 characters with ""key"" roles - and that's not counting the end credit stinger, or the missing characters we thought we would see, or the one that gets a logo tease as a coming attraction for part 2.

Co-writers Stephen McFeely and Christopher Markus had their hands full in working to come up with a coherent story, while allowing so many familiar characters to have at least one moment in the spotlight, if not a few. The fact that AVENGERS: CIVIL WAR divided the group actually allows for multiple segments to play out concurrently. Though we never doubt these fragmented cliques and isolated individuals will fight to save the galaxy, that doesn't necessarily mean they get the band back together. In fact, it's the Guardians of the Galaxy who are a much more cohesive group than our beloved Avengers. But fear not ... there is plenty of fighting and action to go around.

Thanos claims he is saving many interplanetary civilizations and restoring balance with his plan to eliminate half of all living beings. While there might be some scientific evidence to back up his plan, it doesn't sit well with the good guys. More focus is given to his cravings for ultimate control and power provided by tracking down all six Infinity Stones (Tesseract/Space, Mind, Time, Power, Reality, and Soul) to complete his Infinity Gauntlet. Many of these stones are in quite inconvenient locations and require some ingenuity and brute force from Thanos.

Perhaps the travel agent had the biggest challenge as portions of the film take place in New York City, Knowhere, and Wakanda (good luck finding a brochure on those last two). We also get a budding romance from Vision and Scarlet Witch, as well as annoying quasi-romantic banter between Tony Stark and Pepper Potts. And while we are on the ""TMZ"" portion of the review, it should be noted that both Black Widow and Captain America (introducing himself as Steve Rogers) both have new hair styles - though only one of them sports a beard.

In the realm of comic book movies, this would be considered an epic. It has stunning action sequences, remarkable special effects and some terrific comedy mixed in. Of course, you'll have to accept the melodramatic emotions and fear that we haven't been previously subjected, and know that the final finality doesn't arrive for another year. It's very long (more than 2 ½ hours) but it seems to go pretty quickly. The filmmakers have mostly succeeded in the monumental task of remaining true to the history in order to keep comic book fans satisfied, while also creating something that most should be entertained by. Despite lacking the upbeat, feel-good ending we've grown accustomed to, there is a welcome Stan Lee cameo, a post credit stinger (after about 10 minutes of rolling credits). And to top it off, we get ""Rubberband Man"" from The Spinners. Now that's big!",7

An enjoyable blockbuster,25 April 2018,"This film tells the story of the ensemble of Marcel superheroes uniting to fight against an evil man called Thanos.

It is a joy just to watch the numerous famous faces in the film! The story is good, visuals are fantastic, and there are loads of fighting. It has all the elements of a blockbuster.

However, the plot doesn't drive itself, and is not overly engaging because of the vast number of characters in different locations and subplots. It feels a bit fragmented to be. Still, I enjoyed the film a lot. By the way, the ending surprised me a little, and I guess we have to wait for the resolution of the story in the next Avengers gymf.",

(An awful movie in the series) Yes (as all other reviewers who given it an 8 or higher have argued) this movie has had a lot of build up and it is meant to be the ""final"" act; however that doesn't excuse it's inability to create an interesting plot. Similar to HPDH1, this movie focuses too much on setting up for part 2 that is seems like this was more of a money grab. It is a movie worth seeing but perhaps not in theaters. I suggest, have more self control than me and wait until the second part comes out so you can immediately gain some closure that the first part fails to achieve.",6
Too simplistic!,18 May 2018,"I'm tired of the comic based movie genre which further signals the death of original scripts and content. Don't get me wrong, originality alone does not make a good story. This movie continues to try squeeze water from a rock and I leave wanting so much more. The movie was much too long and especially the fight scenes. As in the old Wendy's commercial, ""Where is the beef?"", or in my case a good story and characters I care about.",1
A Cinematic Marvel of Epic Proportions,29 April 2024,"Avengers: Infinity War is a gripping rollercoaster ride that seamlessly weaves together a myriad of beloved Marvel characters and storylines into an epic, action-packed spectacle. From the thrilling battles to the emotional stakes, this film delivers on every front. Thanos emerges as a complex and formidable villain, adding depth and gravity to the narrative. The visual effects are stunning, with jaw-dropping set pieces and breathtaking CGI that keep you on the edge of your seat. With its heart-pounding pace and shocking twists, Avengers: Infinity War is a cinematic marvel that leaves audiences eagerly anticipating the next chapter in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.",8

"Good, but not the best.",28 April 2018,"I liked the movie, but I have some problems with it.

-There were too many jokes. That doesn't mean I didn't like them, or that they ruined the mood, but half of them were unnecessary...they could easily use that time for story and characters.

-Too many characters. The problem isn't exactly what I said, but mostly ""the focus"" of the characters, some characters were there just to be there...they were ok (not bad), but I would rather see more important characters.

In my opinion the best characters in the movie were Thanos, his servents, Iron man, Doctor Strange. A little bit less, but also Thor, Star Lord and Gamora. But for all of them I wish they had more screen time, to be even better.

Wanda and Vision were also pretty important, but personally I didn't really like them that much, I mean they were ok. Vision was also kinda disappointing in terms of power (remember, he was very important and powerful in Age of Ultron).

I also wish that they would spend more time on the stones, their story, powers and things like that.

There are also some other things I want to say (positive, or some nitpicks), but it's really not that important and I don't want to go too much into details. Oh, effects were very good, better than in movies before, so that's why I mentioned it.",8
Sometimes more is less,30 April 2018,"Unpopular opinion: the Avengers movies have been suffering from the law of diminishing returns. The solo movies still work brilliantly, but the giant ensembles started collapsing under the weight of characters and plot lines right around when Ultron showed up. This one faired slightly better for a few reasons. First, the giant cast divided and conquered, allowing for A, B, C, D, and E plots - and each story worked pretty well. Second, they have introduced so many new (and funny) characters to the MCU that this edition was infused with some fresh energy and laughter. Buuuut...there were still too many characters. A movie like this cannot reach the heights of Homecoming, Ragnorok, or Black Panther. Less is more. So this film inevitably succumbed to being more about setting up future franchises than about the characters themselves. It was fun and intense, but I'm looking forward to when the stories get smaller and more focused again.",6
A Homerun for the MCU,29 April 2018,"What do you get when you bring together over 20 of the most talented actors of all time to team up in an effort to save the planet from extinction? Infinity War.... I was blown away by the emotion I felt throughout this movie and I just didn't want it to end. I'm a huge fan of the MCU and before seeing Infinity Wars I watched all of the other Marvel movies in sequence to prepare myself for this masterpiece... let's just say that I was not disappointed by any means. Josh Brolin did an awesome job playing Thanos. I will most likely see this film 3 or 4 more times in theaters before owning it on DVD and Digital. Don't even pay attention to Anyone who rated this movie low (1 thru 5), these people don't have an understanding or the MCU and therefore cannot fully grasp all that this movie masterpiece really offered.",10

Although not perfect, and suffers from multiple forced events and ever changing power levels of some characters, the 3rd Avengers film was a rightful success to the first two.",8

What an movie!,2 April 2022,,9
Too much going on for too little payoff,26 April 2018,"This was an ambitious film. Capping off 10 years of Marvel superhero films. In a nutshell, it confirmed my impression that Marvel are at their best when they focus a film on an individual hero or group of heroes (such as Black Panther or Guardians of the Galaxy). The crossover films tend to suffer from the story being spread too thinly over several story arcs and this film was yet another example of that.

The good. Visual effects were the usual high standard we expect from these films. It's an amazing spectacle. The action sequences were also superb as we've come to expect. What Marvel have always done well, they continued to do well here. Cheeky humour was used in good doses, mostly at appropriate moments (as opposed to the grossly overused and often inappropriately timed humour in Thor Ragnarok).

The bad. There were many corny, predictable moments in this film. For the most part, Marvel were playing it pretty safe. Early in the movie there were a couple of moments where a character appeared without clearly showing who it was, leaving the audience guessing for a few seconds. Would it be Iron man? Captain Americal etc. A little tease before the full reveal. That was cool the first few times. It got old pretty quick, however, by the time they'd used that trick 7 or 8 different times. My overall impression of the first half of the movie was plenty of action. But too much happening with too many characters in too many places. The rapid switching from one location / group of characters to another was often jarring and made it difficult to really care about some of the character arcs and sub plots that were clearly meant to be pretty important. It seemed to lack continuity, flow, whatever you would call it.

The last half of the movie was where Marvel became less predictable and defied expectations. Normally I'd say that's a good thing. Honestly though, I hated the ending. Without spoiling anything, I'd say it left me feeling highly unsatisfied after what was generally a very enjoyable film. Usually I stick around for the post credits scene to enjoy the nice little extra they throw in. This time I stuck around hoping it would improve the ending. It didn't. It seemed a lot of build up to... nothing? I'm sure it was meant to be a bit of a cliff hanger to get us excited for the next Marvel film and I'm sure it's an ending that would appeal to hardcore comic fans. As a casual marvel movie fan though, it left me feeling very flat and overall disappointed with which was otherwise a pretty solid film",7
Awful. Boring. Nothing was good in this movie.,4 May 2018,"I wasn't expecting much going in. I figured it would be all action, since there are so many characters. But I at least thought some of the action would be entertaining. But it wasn't. Not one action scene was any good. Thor Ragnarok was a masterpiece compared to this. This movie was truly dreadful. My girlfriend, who normally likes any superhero movie that's action-packed, even though this movie stunk. Many boring scenes of talking....all about nonsense. Because when every single character can do absolutely anything....when every character has powers that are limitless....like for instance, let's go to outer-space, let's teleport, let's shoot a rope that curves 20 times and wraps around our opponent....when anyone can do anything....the result is total boredom after a short while. The 9.0/10 rating here is Fake News, I guarantee you that. Statistically impossible....especially for such a bad movie. I was sooo bored.",1

Will be the best of the MCU for infinity,4 March 2022,"I cannot describe how incredible Avengers: Infinity War is, I take back what I said about no way home, this is the king of the MCU and one in a million, there has never been anything like it.

It has the best MCU villain by far and Josh Brolin is absolutely amazing as this character, he's an incredible villain that makes you feel all hope is lost.

I don't think any movie will ever do what this done did.

Infinity War never has a single dull moment, it is an extravaganza and also has one of the saddest Marvel deaths.

Marvel gave us the best action sequences since The Avengers in any Marvel movie, and it's the best cliffhanger of all time, the action sequences and direction are truly breathtaking and the character conflicts and scenarios are infinitely interesting, this is the king of Marvel, the best thing to ever come from the MCU, and I'm gonna give it an A+",10
Very Good,25 January 2022,"Whilst I really did quite enjoy this on a big screen, the more I watch it subsequently makes me realise that is all just way to cluttered. With the exception of poor cutie ""Pietro"" who got squished in ""Age of Ultron"" (2015), the world and its Marvellian wife gets in on this act. That, for me, was part of the problem with this film. It's a series of episodic escapades featuring different branches of the family - From ""Loki"" through ""Guardians of The Galaxy"" (was it just me, or did Chris Pratt took a little out of shape, here?); ""Spiderman""; ""Black Panther""; ""Dr. Strange"" and finally, our ""Tony Stark"" led original Avengers. That compendium style of mini-adventures sees each trying to thwart the evil ""Thanos"" (Josh Brolin) who is in search of six infinity stones that will make him all powerful. What ensues are are a series of end-to-end combat scenes with astonishing pyrotechnics and visual effects. The story I found less engaging. There is precious little humour - even the normally charismatic Pratt has little to work with, and the usually reliable Chris Hermsworth's ""Thor' character just features all to sparingly for me. It's a sort of cinematic jigsaw puzzle that has an ending that just screams ""more to come"" at you, and after a whopping great 2½ hours I really could have been doing with something with fewer characters and less constituent moving parts. All of that said, though, it's still a great piece of cinema entertainment but has definitely faded with time.",9
"Yep, I enjoyed that",24 April 2022,"""Avengers: Infinity War"" is a bit of an animal, packed with action, good storyline, a good smattering of humour and really good special effects. The film is packed with many hero characters, that sometimes makes the viewer struggle to work out how they all fit into the script. You have to have watched the previous Marvel movies, in sequence, to recall each characters role and ""powers"". This is a long movie, but it is an action rollercoaster. I have to say that the ending is in true Marvel movies tradition; it is like wadding through extra thick treacle, it is that slow and drawn out. But, it is clever in that it keeps the view hooked and on the edge. It seems like this is it, game over, but we shall see. As I said, this is a really good movie, perhaps the best from Marvel Movies in my opinion, I really enjoyed it. The special effects are just superb, the storyline is full of twists and turns, and all the different actors brought together works in perfect motion. Well worth watching, you will enjoy it I am sure.",9

Marvel united (part 3),7 November 2019,"Here comes the ""Marvel"" movie with sympathies for a supervillain, introduced first in 2012s ""Marvel's Avengers"" post-credit scene. His name is ""Thanos"", motion-capturly performed by actor Josh Brolin, known for Academy Award winning ""No Country for Old Men"" directed by the 'Coen Brothers'. The badass character is coming from outer space to enslave Earth as pathway stone and sweep the entire universe from, in his perspective scum of the galaxies.

What the directors 'Russo Bros.' and producer Kevin Feige achieved here on an 300 million plus production budget comes close to perfect digital movie-making. All characters involved, interlink with there predecessor movies since 2008 ""Iron Man"", starring Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark, who again also here leads the storyline to an inevitable thunder-slashing showdown at ""Black Panther's"" Wakanda battlefield of clashing ""Marvel"" superheroes versus ""Thanos"" supervillain army of beasts.

I liked this picture very much. It reminiscences films from my youth, when political correctness were stretched to the maximum, winning 'Best Picture' Academy awards and the protagonist's nemesis won the rules of the game; as in ""French Connection"" (1971) Fernando Rey's drug-trafficking crime kingpin - ""Silence of the Lambs"" (1991) Anthony Hopkins' Hannibal Lecter - ""Scarface"" (1983) Al Pacino's 'The World is Yours' striking Tony Montana, and surprisingly cliffhanging devil pirat 'Davy Jones', performed by technically revolutionizing mo-cap acting Bill Nighy in ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest"" of summer 2006.",9

The Real Epic Conclusion of the MCU's Early 21st Century,15 December 2023,"I generally like MARVEL characters and their stories, but I'm not a huge fan. The MCU is a bit of a boring universe to me since most of the movies have identical plots. Some are ok, some are really stupid to me, I love a few of them.

""Infiniti War is just one of those exceptions.

Super action and visual effects. Quick but adequate pacing of events. Lots of characters - all colorful and interesting. A meaningful villain with a logical goal he's chasing.

The acting is superb and despite the multitude of characters, even those with little screen time manage to get noticed and attract attention.

There is interesting drama and an epic ending.

A bit of a romance, if there was more Starlord I might have given it a 9 too /the story between Gamora and Starlord I mean/, but that's too much of a fan request, which generally wouldn't fit most audiences.

A perfect ending to the MCU universe for me personally. Most of the stuff after that is utter crap.

But this one is a brilliant SUPERHERO movie.

Final score: 8/10.",8
Till they assemble,19 July 2019,"Here's my review of AVENGERS INFINITY WAR. That's right I had to type that title in caps cause that's how big this movie is. It's a Visual 'Marvel'. Get it ? Visual ""Marvel"". That's a bad attempt at humor.sorry. Moving on , iw is directed by the Russo brothers and stars almost everyone ?!. Now the story has a lot of arcs to it but is centralized to one Thanos. I loved how they set up character introductions along the way and made sure there was no phasing issues which is really important in a movie close to 3 hours. This movie is a really dark one but the one liners and humour are spot on and are never forced anywhere unlike justice league *cough* *cough*. I also loved how they took time to explore other worlds in the movie while there was so much going on , there is a lot going on in this movie , like a lot ! . But just like any other movie on the hype train it does have it's flaws. Remember how I said there were many arcs , sometimes the switch from one arc to another takes a really long time . Other than that , ok what else ? . The CGI in this movie is amazing but personally I thought they could've done better with iron man's armor. And even the little details on Josh brolins face were really good. And when you finally feel like these arcs are gonna combine and all for something bigger , then BOOM ! A cliffhanger right there.And it's an ending I'm still trying to figure out. In the end , avengers infinity war is something which travels beyond expectation , with great characters , a gripping story , great visuals and a cliffhanger ending for the avengers to actually ""assemble"" in the next movie (hopefully) .",8

"The best film, ever",20 January 2022,,9
I like it,19 January 2022,"The standard for every crossover movie Though this is not my favorite MCU movie I think ""Infinity War"" is the best product the studio produced both because of the really high scope and because of the execution itself. I think the movie is so great because it contains almost everything you could ask (action, humor, heartfelt moments, great CGI, fantastic score, ...) in a balanced way. Furthermore even if the culmination of the MCU happened in ""Endgame"" it was here that every piece of the Marvel Universe was brought together for the first time. I remember to have an astronomical hype at the time and the fact that the movie resulted to be even better than what my hype was making envisioning me is something that I highly count. But the best part of this movie is its villain, Thanos. I loved him (and still do) and he absolutely stole the show and sets up Endgame perfectly. Clearly ""Infinity War"" has its flaws and I am not here to say it is perfect like a 10/10 rating would usually mean, but for what it represented at the time and the way it was delivered I think we couldn't have asked for more.",10
Sentimentality for sale,6 August 2018,"Let's admit it, people love watching sacrifices made out of love. We just can't get enough of that mushy pathos of the most pointless, irrational and simply plain wrong things being done just because it would lessen the suffering of a single human being (or maybe even a puppy), albeit just for a moment.

This is humanity. And, judging by the rating, it is madly in love with Avengers Infinity War. Well, no surprise, since, for the first time in a while, Marvel Studios made a film that dwarfs most of the melodramas ever created in terms of making the soft-hearted people shed a tear or two. The war is waging across the whole galaxy over the topic of sheer survival of myriads of living beings, and our brave heroes, so eager to care none about the collateral damage before, have suddenly become too soft to handle the fact that someone might not make it eventually.

And what a time to grow a conscience! Thanos is about, the looming figure from the past Marvel movies, the phantom menace of this cinematic universe, and he's come to strike it big this time. And with him, a huge army of creatures equally ugly and disposable and a few special units he calls his children, finally with a speck of individuality, but still ugly as the rest. Makes you start wondering if those Titan genes are really the best judge of the galaxy's fate.

As for ""the good guys"", they are quite aplenty too. Maybe even too aplenty to actually have any decent interaction among each other, unless we count some quarrels and a few flashy co-op FPS action scenes interaction. Tom Holland does try to bring his old lively ""friendly neighborhood Spider-Man"" attitude, but he's severely outnumbered in this game of big talk and personal issues. Even Steve Rogers, the only guy who was previously known for bringing charisma and integrity into everything he's involved in, is demoted to a mere fighting machine. He's good at that, no doubt about it, but after Winter Soldier and Civil War you expect much, much more from that character. But this time your expectations are your own problem I'm afraid.

The rest you have probably seen yourself - and if you haven't then you probably should, because, even with its somewhat generic and one-dimensional taste, Infinity War is still quite good as an action flick. The moving figures won't let you doze off too soon, and a few ""deep"" dialogue scenes will keep your palate from getting too numb if you have a taste for anything besides punches and gunshots.

Still, after all we've seen from Marvel in these ten years, Infinity War leaves a rather dull aftertaste. Not as pathetic as Iron Man 3, but something between GotG2 and Thor Dark World. In other words, the intense buildup and high expectations make the actual endeavor feel faded. Like all those figures from the ending, this movie doesn't present any substantial endpoint - but rather flakes away, so that instead of feeling absolutely overwhelmed you simply go check on your Instagram updates while the (surprisingly rather impressive) ending credits score keeps banging, find no new posts and feel somewhat disappointed.

The film wasn't bad per se. But most of the fan theories and memes people generated while waiting for this to hit the theaters were indeed more exciting. In a way, that does create a balance of sorts, something Thanos would have appreciated, but, as for you, I wouldn't be so sure.",6

Masterpiece in Entertainment,27 May 2020,"Avengers: Infinity War is unlike anything you've ever seen before. It is 10 years in the making, with 20 instalments leading up to it, all designed to introduce our lineup of 30 odd characters and hint at fragments of Infinity War plot throughout. When I left the cinema I couldn't quite believe the Russo brothers had actually managed to pull it off. On the face of it, the film should be a total mess, with too many characters and too many storylines unfolding in unison. But they absolutely smash it, creating a masterpiece which the likes of have never been seen before and most likely will never be seen again.

Thanos is the ultimate villain and about the best I've seen - not just in the superhero genre. His motives and actions throw your moral compass into disarray, creating a dynamic viewing experience. What's more, I can't think of any other film in the MCU where we don't genuinely believe from the outset that our heroes will survive and prevail to save the day, but with Infinity War these certainties cannot be so assured - the stakes are so much higher. The opening scene sets the tone, and from here on in there is no guarantee who will be left standing when the final credits role.

The story throws together characters from across the franchise in the most unexpected fashion - Thor teaming up with his good friends Rabbit and Tree; Tony Stark and Peter Quill fighting Thanos side by side. So much enjoyment stems from these unlikely groupings, and watching all these characters who we know and love, interacting and bouncing off each other, is just the definition of entertainment.

In the end Infinity War has you laughing and crying, often in the same scene, with a finale so shocking and unanticipated that it doesn't lose its impact no matter how many times you watch it over. Overall it is the best Marvel has to offer, and I don't think it will ever be topped. 10/10.",10

Far too much of a good thing...,30 April 2018,"This is a very good film (brilliant in places), with good character time for most, some reasonable humour alongside the violence, but it's bloated - just far, far too long. By the time it wraps you give up caring. And it feels like the MCU is nearing the end with its visibly aging stars.",7

Is 'Avengers: Infinity War' the Beginning of the End for the MCU?,27 April 2018,"Like every other geek in the world, I was stoked to see 'Avengers: Infinity War.' I bought my tickets in advance. I got a soda that was way too large to drink in two and a half hours. I argued with some teenager who tried to steal my seat. I sat in jittery anticipation once the lights went down... And I was left wanting once the credits ran.

'Avengers: Infinity War' was the equivalent of Marvel's money shot. It's been building to this since the first 'Avengers' movie showed Thanos peeking over his shoulder with a cocky smile on his face. Since then, they've been hinting at the inevitable confrontation that was bound to happen between Earth's mightiest heroes and some big purple spaceman. With Avengers: Infinity War, we see Thanos actually get off his ass and do something, and he does a lot and yet nothing at the same time.

The biggest problem that 'Avengers: infinity War' suffers from is that it tries to do so much in so little time. Fans of the MCU are well aware that there are more heroes than you can shake a stick at and 'Infinity War' stuffs all of them in, in one way or another. Of course, the big three (Chris Hemsworth, Chris Evans, and Robert Downey Jr.) get their share of screen time, everyone else thought has minimal roles to play throughout the film. Tom Holland is Marvel's newest plaything, so he gets plenty of time, but the rest of the big heroes are shoehorned in such a way that screams ""contractual obligation."" Then again, I don't think any fan is something to be upset about seeing their favorite heroes finally meet on the big screen (especially when it comes to Robert and Benedict Cumberbatch). The problem is that none of them really get a chance to stretch their legs.

I have to admit 'Avengers: Infinity War' definitely has some feels in it. Oddly enough, most of these feels come from Thanos himself (Josh Brolin). He's supposed to be the big bad of the MCU, but it seems like his heart is in the right place, even if he's a pretty extreme pragmatist. Still, his character isn't laughing evilly in the wings as he commits acts on par with the worst war crime I can think of. Instead, he struggles. He sees the cost and even admits that achieving his goal costs him everything in the end. So, is it all worth it?

Who knows! The damn thing basically ends in a ""to be continued.""

'Avengers: Infinity War' suffers from trying to do so much that the editing can't possibly keep up with it. There's no downtime between the action sequences, which doesn't mean that they aren't any less spectacular. It just means that there's no time to let anything sink in before the movie is rushing off to the next sequence. That being said, the heroes all achieve a new level of badass-dom, especially Chris Evans as Captain America. The guy is a beast this time around. Unfortunately, there is so much going on that it can be hard to figure out what's going on mid-flight.

This brings me to another point when it comes to 'Avengers: Infinity War.' The damn thing is so busy when it comes to its visuals, that I honestly don't think it's worth seeing in 3D. For the first few minutes of the movie, I couldn't understand what was happening. Apparently, though there was quite a beatdown when it came to Thanos and Hulk. Enough so that Hulk gets performance anxiety. Something I find odd since Thanos actively avoids the Hulk in the comics. I'm not going to knick pick about this though, because I'm not a neckbeard nerd.

Look, here's the bottom line, 'Avenger: Infinity War' is a fun movie. It's competently made by the Russo Brothers, who are Marvel's golden boys. Is it everything that fan might want? No. Does it live up to what it promises? No. Is it still something fanboys should throw money at and be happy they get it? Probably.

You're not going to be disappointed in 'Avengers: Infinity War,' but Marvel does not have the right to act all high and mighty after this. I'm sure 2019 will bring a ""sequel"" that will make it all worthwhile. As of right now though, 'Avengers: Infinity War' is kind of a disappointment. It's a letdown. There have been so many good movies this past year from Thor: Ragnarok to Black Panther that Marvel ended up raised the bar. It had to stumble at some point, it's just lucky that it only stumbled and didn't fall flat on its face with 'Avengers: Infinity War.'",7

Enjoyable but a Disjointed Mess,7 May 2018,"Marvel have embarked on a massive project to link up many movies over a decade to a grand finale featuring all of the main heroic characters of the movies. However, the inifinity stones are more of a thread linking the movies than a story in itself. The story of the stones is what infinity wars is about. So it's a new story but populated with characters already developed so the character development is that of Thanos, the villain. Josh Brolin is brilliant as Thanos but his back story is a biit lame, perhaps as a result of distillation from the comics, but still for a movie of this scale a bit thin. All of the Marvel characters are involved and it is just too much for the film, giving it an air of contrivance, Comic relief is probvided largely by the Guardians of the Galaxy even that is not so fresh anymore. On the whole it is enjoyable family fluff but falls in many respects due to ridiculous levels of suspension of disbelief.",6

"Like a Fine Wine, The Avengers Get Better With Each Film",6 May 2019,"With every Marvel Cinematic Universe film, the stories get better and they each get deeper. They also are getting longer, this film runs for 2 and 1/2 hours. Well worth the runtime, and you'll get a glimpse of nearly every MCU character to date, which is cool.

Is the end of the MCU coming? Maybe in a few years from now (2019), it'll be epic!! The Disney studio has done a tremendous job with bringing the films from script to screen. I may be a tad biased, but the MCU is much better and higher quality than the DC universe. In twenty years, the MCU films will be remembered much better.

Infinity War is a great comic book film! Watch the entire MCU to understand the story though, or you'll be lost. Happy watching.",8

Feels like a Joss Whedon movie not the Russo brothers....,30 April 2018,"Thanos was great as villain (his motives, not so much), the action scenes were good, I liked most of the character interactions, there were some emotional scenes that were done well, and a few things will transpire that you won't see coming, which was very exciting. A lot of the humor was contrived; some of those emotional/dramatic scenes were ruined by poorly timed jokes, something that Ragnarok and GotGv2 suffered from immensely. Way too overcrowded with so many heroes and not enough characters development. The plot is good but it's a mess. Doctor strange was a great addition to avengers movie but not with star lord and his crews. Overall it is a forgetable movie as it has absolutley no impact for the MCU. Eveirthing they did in this movie will be undone in the next one, and that is for sure.",7
A cinematic feat like no other,24 April 2019,Another hit by Marvel assembling the Avengers against one of the most intimidating movie villains in history - Thanos. It took them over 20 movies to get to their most defying antagonist and the wait was worth it. Josh Brolin's performance as Thanos truly stands out among a sea of Hollywood A-listers portraying characters that became iconic. The movie is a action packed thrill ride from the opening until the shocking ending and it keeps you on the edge of your seat during the whole run-time. A must watch and one of the cultural phenomenons of modern cinema which will be remembered and re-watched by generations to come.,10
"7,5 is a better way to put it, not 7.",30 April 2018,"First, I would like to point out that this is not a bad movie but it is definitely not the greatest.

Let's talk about the plot first. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone who haven't watched at least 3 latest Marvel movies since I know to some people, this will be their first Marvel movie. But if you don't mind some strange confusing parts going on during the movie then I think you would be good to go. The plot was conveniently worked out. Not perfectly worked out, just conveniently. The pace overall and the fightings make the whole movie kinda overwhelming. If I have to rate the overall script, I won't know where to start. It would definitely take another watch to fully understand and make some review. Plot/script: 7?/10

The best thing about this movie is the visual effects. It really can be seen that Marvel took time and efforts to take this to a whole new level. Impressive and very well executed. An ultimate safe way to rescue the movie from being a fail blockbuster. Visual effects: 10/10

Like any Marvel movie, you cannot miss the humor. It's still the same sense of humor: ""easy to capture and straight to the punchline without minding a lot about the timing"", IW actually did a better way to execute jokes in this movie if compared to other Marvel movies. The timing make more sense and it doesn't throw people off the rails because of the jokes that much anymore. I get the reason behind this but I would give this comedy a go. Humor: 8/10

That's everything that I think Marvel improved after 10 years of a great franchise. Now to some stuff that I think they still need to work on it a bit more.

The character development still isn't one of the main things that Marvel cares about. Especially in IW, there are still some confusing and sometimes make no sense parts. Characters have a lot of potential to make IW an even better movie but unfortunately, the extension of the movie didn't allowed. Can't blame them for this but if they could improve it in next solo movies it would be great. The character designs were great, except Thanos. He looked weird, not so scary and can be improved. Of course, this is just my opinion.

There are two things make this movie unenjoyable. First, the music. It doesn't make sense. It doesn't connect to the things happening on the screen. It's a mess. The score could make the movie more enjoyable or absolutely destroy the scene. And the IW score is just disappointing. The magic of the movie is gone. If it wasn't for the visual effects that save the experience, I wouldn't know how this movie would turned out since the score was poorly designed. I'm not saying the music is bad, it's the timing that's terrible.

Secondly, the camera work. It got worse as the movie closers to the end. Especially at a scene of Doctor Strange and Iron Man conversation, the camera pan destroyed the mood. They could have edited that, but they didn't which is kinda disappointing. Another scene at the end, the camera just shake a lot. It like the camera man just lost control of their camera. Again, it just makes the mood of the scene disappear.

Overall, I would say this movie gets a 7,5/10. I expected it to be an 8 based on what I get from the trailer. It was over average, a good generics film, a great improvement over the years of a fantastic franchise. The only things I cannot handled is the score and the camera work.

Was it worth the money? Yes. Would you watch it the second time? Yes.",7

"Good, but Lazy",20 March 2019,"""Avengers: Infinity War"" (2018) is a professionally produced action adventure film about The Avengers and their eventual allies coming together to stop the growing powers of Thanos, played by Josh Brolin. I must admit I felt different from the beginning of the film to the end. I will sum it up by saying, it was joyful to see so many of my favorite characters come together until the end and leave it at that. It is difficult to really dive into what this film is about without being repetitive of prior super hero movies or completely giving the film away. However, staying in tradition of a Marvel super hero film, it is a fresh take that hits most of the normal marks excluding the conclusion.

The acting of this star-studded film, as expected is, dead on marvelous. It's not overly hokey like some of the hero films tend to be. The Russo brothers also did an immaculate job in directing this film. The fight scenes were very vivid and gripping in every sequence. In contrast, I do believe this film may have been a little long for my taste. I really think if the script would have been slimmed down to focus on Thanos' search for the stones and the Avengers and allies trying to stop him, there wouldn't be so many moments that feel like they drag on. I also believe there should have been some type of ""actual"" call to action for the Avengers in the end. I know there is a proposed continuation, but it feels like a lazy conclusion.",7

The characters meet each other and team up without it being forced, and the tone perfectly is set from the very beginning that s**t it hitting the fan. Thanos is not just evil, he genuinely believes hes making the world a better place. He needed to be the best villian of the series and he easily is. The things he does in this movie. Sheesh. This is his movie. These characters have come such a long way, and we got to be there for it all. Which makes it so hard to watch as they all fail, and inevitably fall.

Wow,2 May 2018,"Wow. This movie is espectacular we have waiting for this moment 10 years ago for the moment that Iron Man gains the knowledge of the people, I just say thank you marvel and thank you Disney to make me happy.

This movie it's espectacular visually is tremendous. It's incredible how many people are working to make this movie an awesome movie. I think is the best movie of the MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe) beacuse this movie puts together all the stiles of the 18 movies that we have seen before and it does incredibly awesome.

We have an incredible cast: Benedict Cumberbatch as Doctor Strange, Tom Holland as Spider Man, Chris Hemstworth as Thor all of them are incredible and Unic of this characters that they represent.

One thing that have this movie and don't have the other movies of the MCU is the villain Thanos is the best villain of the MCU, it's incredibly powerful and it has sense that all of our superheroes are fighting against him.

Let's talk about the bad things about Avengers Infinity War.

Avengers Infinity war has a lot of howls, there are so many moment that the movie has that you don't understand why happens something and instead that respond all the questions that we have they make that we should question ourselves many things more than we question at the first time.

So I totally recommend Avengers Infinity War.",7
Weak character representation in the Hulk,26 September 2019,"Being a huge comic book fan for over 50 years, I would have given this movie a 10 out of 10 but for only the way they treated the character of the Hulk badly .Especially in the confrontation with Thanos at the begging of the movie. In my view Hulk was not shown anywhere near his past representations of what I know of the Hulk to be. I always believed that if you start a fist fight with him you will loose. He is known for getting stronger as he gets madder. Just look at the fight with the abomination in the Hulk movie. Which is part of the MCU Universe canon, that why I was very disappointed when they diminished his worth as the character to what I always knew him to be etc..Anyway I still very much enjoyed the movie.",9
A mixed bag.,27 April 2018,,7
Kitsch,1 May 2018,"The movie is a great example of kitsch. A definition from web: ""Kitsch is art that's garish, nostalgic, and very low-brow. Some people who love the aesthetics of souvenir culture think kitsch is really cool, while others think it's in very poor taste.

Kitsch is a German word that's been adopted into English, meaning ""worthless, trashy art,"" or the quality of that art. A ceramic figurine of a puppy with sad eyes is pretty kitsch, as is a velvet Elvis painting. Of course some people think that kitsch is really beautiful and fill their homes with stuff that other people consider trashy souvenirs. If your painting teacher tells you your portraits are kitsch, that's probably not a compliment.""",1
MCU's Magnum Opus,3 September 2023,"10 years in the making and 18 films building up to the moment that would define the Infinity Saga's legacy for decades to come. I distinctly remember the lead up to this film, a crucial moment in blockbuster filmmaking. It's an accumulation of a decade's worth of comic book storytelling through film, a genre that has become divisive in recent years to say the least, but you get what you come for here, and that's what matters.

For anyone that grew up on comic books, you are certainly familiar with how large-scale crossover events always came to be, and having that feeling replicated on the big screen is something any fan will always cherish. There was a lot that this film had to accomplish, too many to list in fact, but perhaps the most vital was crafting a villain as memorable as Thanos the Mad Titan. If Thanos fails, then the whole film does as well. Yet, thanks to one of the strongest comic book film scripts and a timeless performance by Josh Brolin, as well as some of the most incredible computer-generated character design, Thanos is cemented as one of, if not the, quintessential comic book movie villains of all time. Almost every line of his has become part of the cultural zeitgeist, this generations The Empire Strikes Back (1980).

Endlessly rewatchable and satisfying, filled with lots of incredible character moments and interactions, my favourite being those between Stark and Strange. The entirety of the action sequence on Titan is breathtaking, one that I always come back to. Filled with impressive choreography and a fulfilling use of each character's abilities, as well as serving as a key moment in the entire saga, it's definitely my personal highlight.

There are some issues that I've always had. One being how Bruce Banner/Hulk is handled, he is definitely a character that you feel the directors/writers did not know what to do with due to the amount of characters. Tony's suit is really ugly, it's baffling that a suit crafted in 2018 looks worse than the ones in 2008, and it's due to the over reliance on CGI.

Overall, this is where the MCU peaked for me. I do enjoy other remaining entries such as Endgame, No Way Home, and GOTG Vol.3. But if I'm being honest, Disney/Marvel have done irreparable damage to the MCU brand with their Phase 4 entries and how everything else is being handled. Much like their comic counterparts, after every peak there becomes an abundance of characters and storylines, a confusion of direction and a misguided desire to replicate an event previously planned for almost a decade in a matter of a few years.

At least we'll always have the Infinity Saga to look back on.",10

Best comic book movie ever,27 September 2020,Best comic book movie ever and the best way to end marvel cinematic world,10
Best. Superhero. Movie.,24 January 2020,"Infinity War... where to start with this one.

Opening night was something spectacular for me when it came to this film. I went in with the same anticipation I had for most Marvel movies- which is to say excited but not expecting anything more than good. I am so glad that what we got rose above that threshold to be something I will never forget.

From the very start the film grips you by putting the focus almost entirely on Thanos as it's central figure and killing off characters that were just saved only a movie ago in Thor: Ragnarok. This cold open was enough for me to be sold on Thanos as a character and the film enhances him more and more as it goes on.

I have to give huge props to Marvel for letting the Russos, Stephen McFeely and Christopher Marcus be more impactful with this movie and it was well worth the hype. The action scenes carry the movie and are all well thought out, engaging, and creative to the big screen. Not one scene is wasted and the forward momentum keeps you enticed.

Alan Silvestri- what a comeback for his time with the MCU. He had previously only scored Captain America: The First Avenger and The Avengers before being dropped in favor of other composers for the next few projects. Him being back on for Infinity War gives the movie a score that enhances it's operatic weight to heights I did not expect. I knew his score would be great but so many moments are made by the music alone. The triumphant Avengers theme playing at the beginning as I had hoped since Age of Ultron was satisfying and the ending, that ending, was film score perfection. One of the best end credit suites to most recent blockbusters.

Another thing that was striking was the Russo's approach to color in this movie as most Marvel movies all share the same 2010 gritty bland-gray look and take away from some of the fun costumes. This time around they nailed the look, allowing for scenes to pop with their greenscreened backgrounds by having the sets lit identically to how they wanted them to look on film.

One of the biggest achievements of this movie was Thanos himself and all the VFX work that made him believable. That's extremely commendable but has done so too many times and I would rather praise the great VFX and artwork in general. The sound design and CGI blend to create a cosmic comicbook world that looks like something straight out of a conceptual artbook. There are tiny details in every VFX shot that sell these characters' interactions and action beats. Iron Man's nano armor was a stand out and the great colors of Nidavellir contrast the rest of the film to sell the third act.

The ending is what made this movie as big as it is- the heroes lose, what's not to love about that? It felt like The Empire Strikes Back for this franchise and a true epic finale to every story we had been presented so far. Getting to see these characters beat down was satisfying and had some of the most poignant scenes in the end. The infamous porch scene is a standout and is incredibly memorable- and daunting. No one was prepared for this and it made this movie all the more special.

There is so much more to say about Marvel's greatest achievement (in my opinion) but I think most of it has already been said. This is my favorite superhero movie of all time and I don't see any other topping it any time soon.",10

Amazing,21 August 2018,Infinity war is an overcrowded blockbuster that does not disappoint. While Josh Brolin delivers a performance of a lifetime as thanos. Putting the mcu in its most toughest spot yet.,
To Infinity and Wait,29 April 2018,"As long as the stone is not a kidney stone, Purple Homer Simpson's Gotta Catch 'Em All!

I had a couple of concerns before going into this feature and thankfully: I was wrong on both of them. Number one: I was dreading an hour plus long battle like at the end of Lord of the Rings 2-3, Matrix 3 and any Transformers movie. Personally, anything longer than 20 minutes of on-screen battles bore me. If I'm at home watching them, I will literally pull out my phone and play games while the battle rages on. This did not happen here. Thank you so much. I really didn't want to take a break and leave the theatre during a far-too-long battle scene.

And number two: I was concerned about the aforementioned Purple Homer Simpson. In the brief moments we've seen him before, he looked incredibly corny and fake and I never once believed he would be as all-powerful as they built him up to be. BUT, he ended up being the best character of the entire 16,090 characters they chose for this Part 3a. He was deep, interesting and the CGI wasn't that bad.

Now, the rest of the characters...were spot on from the same characters we grew with and loved for the past decade. Not a single actor stepped out of bounds and they owned their scenes.

So, yeah, you simply cannot go into Avengers 3a without seeing, well, all of the previous 18 films. Most specifically, Thor: Ragnarok, the Guardians of the Galaxy films and Captain America: Civil War. But to sum up this mercifully simple plot, a big baddie is attempting to collect all the stones that originated the universe so he can play God with his warped sense of mercy. Our heroes, or ""Avengers,"" are spread out and thin across the universe, but do have a common goal of preventing Purple Homer Simpson from achieving his collection.

I already knew this before going in, but if you didn't, you should prepare yourself for a Lord of the Rings 1-2 conclusion and an Empire Strikes Back storm before the calm. And also, for only 2nd or 3rd time in the ENTIRE MCU library, the post-credit scene is absolutely necessary to see. The other 15 or so times, I say just skip the post-credit scenes and wait to see them on the net. This one, yes, you really should see.

The movie got some many things right and a few minor errors. What went right: they chopped down the humor. In most Marvel movies, the humor seems to be 80% of the script leaving a small percentage for Superhero'ing action. I did find myself laughing out loud here a few times, but thankfully, it was just a few sprinkled jokes. I was there to see a Superhero movie and not another comedy.

Also, as stated, the characters were spot on and the action scenes were intense, fresh and wholeheartedly used every bit of the Avenger in those scenes to their absolute potential. Further, aside from some major pacing and editing choices (MAN, some scenes seemed to end and the camera just kept on rolling for upwards of 5 seconds on more than a dozen scenes,) the movie never felt too long and certainly not 2½ hours.

I can't give away my other huge gripe with this movie (other than the pacing/editing) without spoilers, but suffice to say, the third act, specifically the final moments really irked me. And no, not the abrupt ending - again, this was basically the ending to the first two Lord of the Rings movies. I hope, like I stated above, I am wrong on how I see the ending to this when I observe how Part 3b is handled. If I am wrong, then the stars I gave this movie will suddenly rise.

Avengers Part 3a doesn't hold a candle to Avengers 1, but it does blow Part 2 out of the water. Still, you definitely need Part 2 to have any of Part 3a. Infinity War is definitely recommended, but I'd probably wait until the day Part 3b comes out and make sure you see, um, all of the previous 18 films prior, as well.

***

Final thoughts: Since this movie is really just a first half of an overall chapter, I'd probably have to wait until Part 3b comes out before completely forming an opinion on where this ranks. That said, right now, I know it absolutely ranks high in the (so-far) 19 MCU films.",7
Wow!,28 December 2018,"My greatest fear of endless war was as follows: 1- How are they going to gather so many heroes and make them non-disposable? 2 - how are they going to make a villain so AWESOME that it makes sense for so many heroes to come together to defeat him. And the film responded to me in the most incredible way: Each hero has his role in the plot, as are 4 jewels to be protected the film made situations for the heroes to meet and protect these jewels, and these situations are great. The villain is generic, but as the film presents us he is better able to perceive his motivations and that he is not simply generic but unique. An incredible movie with beautiful scenery, breathtaking action sequences and a script that gets better as we know the marvel universe better",9

Dares to be different and succeeds on every level,26 April 2018,"Firstly, you need to watch this film free from spoilers.

From the opening scene, the antagonist is centre stage and carries the film throughout. Flawed in his character and convinced that he is forthright in his convictions and will let absolutely nothing stop him from achieving his goal.

The action carries the film through perfectly, interrupted by the gentle phase between scenes and story arcs then ramps up the pace to breakneck speed throughout until the closing scene.

Acting is fantastic, dialogue between the cast is executed to perfection and never gets crowded or shoehorned in for plot as has other recent super hero films. The rapport from the characters across different franchises caries them through the comedy moments, the desperation when they appear to hit rock bottom and the plight of each character delivers emotional sentiment as yet unseen in a Marvel movie.

My criticism? Thanos' black order felt a little rushed and disproportionate to his screen time so you didn't get to know their characters as well as you should have. And yes, certain scenes feel disjointed but they are supposed to as they will be resolved in Avengers 4.

My best Marvel film to date. Cannot recommend it enough.",10
"Infinity War is brave, brilliant and spectacular",25 April 2018,"Infinity War is the pinnacle of what blockbuster films should be. Directed by the Russo brothers, they manage to achieve the almost impossible feat of culminating all the characters and their stories into one epic film. The action, the characters, the story and the overall experience is spectacular to behold. Each characters has their own moment to shine, as we see new fun and somewhat emotional interactions between characters and story arcs that pay off as the film progresses . The result is a film that often feels surprisingly earnest and emotional. It pays off our emotional investment into these great characters over each of the 18 previous films through a great culmination of storytelling. The humor we have come to expect in Marvel films is lively and full of banter, particularly between Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) and Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), and the quick-fire interplay between Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and the Guardians of the Galaxy. Unlike Marvel's cascade of villains who are turned secondary to their superhero counterparts, Thanos (Josh Brolin) is the central character in this epic, with a moral compass that is beyond what many might expect. Whilst he may seem to be the most demonic villain that the Avengers have come across, he is by far and away the most complex of them all, testament to the directing and writing of the film. There's a lot going on in this movie, with many scenes occurring almost simultaneously, leaving the ending on a much vague yet appropriate cliffhanger. Overall, Infinity War epitomizes the perfect blockbuster film that ends in poetic grace and is sure to leave you questioning what will happen next.",10
Marvel have done it again!,25 April 2018,"A culmination of year's worth of effort, groundwork and master-planning that started way back in 2008 with the seemingly risky Iron Man (wow I am getting old!), Infinity War has a world of expectations riding on the back of its hero-filled shoulders but as Marvel have proved time and time again, they're masters of meeting expectations and as is the case with this epic, messing with expectations as the Russo Brothers deliver what will be the year's biggest and most talked about blockbuster.

Kicking things off with a memorable opening act that makes it clear we're in for a relatively unpredictable affair, Infinity War is a long and eventful action packed ride, the type of which must make the DC film hierarchy cry on top of their mountians of money, made from the mainly mediocre film offerings they have been toiling away on in the wake of Marvel and Disney's seemingly endless winning streak.

Infinity War is filled with dazzling visuals, laugh out loud humor and a fair share of heart and soul, all of which feels earnt and appropriate in light of the decades worth of happenings that have come before it.

It may not have the novelty factor and unexpected awesomeness that ran through the veins of the very first Avengers outing but after so much time and commitment, Marvel and Disney and in turn us the audienece have invested into this saga, Infinity War feels like something more than your average summer blockbuster experience that's event heavy and many various narrative strands are near perfectly juggled by the Russo Brothers.

With so many key figures and important character arcs to deal with, its to be expected that certain players get less to do than others and some aspects of past occurances don't get much airtime but overall, fans of all shapes and sizes will find much to enjoy from the films beginning through to the films final frame as each hero and villain get their time to shine, with only this year's huge success Black Panther feeling like he may as well have stayed at home as the world fights for its survival.

Fighting against purple baddie Thanos, the world and the universe have found a worthy adversary and pre-release doubts about Thanos feeling and looking menacing enough (doubts of which I shared) are quickly dispelled here with Josh Brolin doing a great job under the guise of his CGI performance, Thanos really is a piece of work and feels likely to be the Marvel universes greatest of big bads.

Without entering into spoiler territory, aspects of Thanos's journey, his inward torments and motivations and his interactions are all handled extremely well and come the films climax, its clear Marvel have created a character and end game that will be both controversial and much-talked about for months and years to come.

Final Say -

There's a lot that can be said about Infinity War but most importantly this is a high-class blockbuster experience that feels like a worthy final piece of the puzzle to this particular phase of the Marvel cinematic universe.

At times thrilling, funny, heartfelt and always entertaining, Infinity War will please all those who've followed the comic book series for the many year's gone before, with the Russo's film likely to be the king of 2018 blockbuster field.

How come Disney's films are always over rated in IMDB?,17 May 2018,,6
It Feels Like a Real Comic Book Movie,29 April 2018,"Some could argue that the booming comic book film industry has grown a little stale since its inception with 2000's blockbuster X-men. Some argue that it's just the same shtick of hero-fights-bad-guy. There are a few titles that have been absolute standouts that work in a vacuum as a piece of media, such as the Dark Knight trilogy and Logan. However, one disappointment I've long held is that the stories don't feel like a comic book.

Naturally, stuff is inherently lost in adaptation from comic book to the big screen. If you want to see what happens when we try to re-create media in a new medium, you need look no farther than 2014's The Killing Joke. The last third of the film was nearly panel-by-panel identical to the original comic, but most fans would tell you that the comic is still head and shoulders above. But, that's neither here nor there.

The essence or flavor of comic books was perfectly expressed in Sam Raimi's Spider-man Trilogy (yes, even the third one). The stories seemed to juggle subplot and characters, but the narrative weaved them all together effortlessly. Some of the most effective moments in a film were just that - moments. These films showed a deep respect and appreciation for comic books.

Then, Batman and Iron Man show up, and the stories gained a new form. Like I said, adaptations inevitably require changes, but it seemed like the studios had abandoned this style. I did see glimpses of it in films like the first Avengers and in Civil War, but for the most part, I was slightly disappointed.

Infinity War brings it back. It feels like an event comic. The story trades back and forth between several subplots, the heroes don't need to explain who they are or their backstory and motivations because we already know these characters, we've spent films with them. The villain is menacing and memorable (I'd say even more compelling than Thanos in the original Infinity Gauntlet comic). Characters die and there's already setup for them to come back. The story is somehow organically a collection of moments yet still somehow flows as a compelling whole.

Avengers: Infinity War is a big, dumb, action flick. The dialogue, shot composition, editing, etc., are all above-average, but none of it is pushing cinema to new heights. What makes it great is the feeling it can give the audience thanks to great characters and good storytelling.",8

Marvel takes it to the next level.,25 April 2018,"Ever since the massively successful experiment in shared universe building that was the original Avengers, it has felt somewhat like Marvel have been cruising along at the same level. Although there have been plenty of excellent films in the meantime, nothing has really matched the relative scope and ambition of that first Avengers film, best encapsulated by the somewhat disappointingly formulaic Age of Ultron. Infinity War feels like that game changer, and Marvel upping a gear, showcasing a level of ambition in terms of scope of story and characters only seen before in adaptations of epic fantasy such as Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter, in fact several times the film put me in mind of Return of the King. In terms of what is a purely cinematic narrative (based of course on decades of comics) the sheer scale of the film is surely unique. Despite a run time of two hours forty minutes, the film rarely drags due to a break neck pace that never lets up, there is none of the dull opening exposition and set up that often hurts these films. On the down side, this is likely to leave those who aren't caught up on the series somewhat lost, while it is not essential to have seen every single Marvel film, it is probably important to have seen a large proportion of them. It also finally feels like Marvel has overcome it 'Villain Problem', similar to the success of Michael B Jordan's character in Black Panther, Josh Brolin's Thanos is an excellent antagonist, with tangible motives and an engaging presence. What is perhaps most remarkable about the film is that, it manages its large cast so effectively, not a single moment is wasted and all major characters have their moment to shine, all thanks to the incredibly efficient pacing and stucture. Infinity War feels like the best film it could be. The vast scope means that it is impossible for it to quite engage on the same level as the more 'low key' solo entries in the genre, and the necessities of the fast pacing make it exhausting watching at times. Ultimately though, the film is a wild ride and emotional roller-coaster that is not to be missed for fans of the franchise.",9

Fun Movie Despite Repetitive Plot,1 May 2018,"I really enjoyed this film. It's biggest weakness was its repetitive plot, but its character interactions were pure joy and the way Thanos was developed as a character was a delight.

PROS:

Great character interactions. Seeing these heroes from diverse properties finally meet and interact in such interesting ways was really satisfying.

Well developed bad guy. Thanos is interesting and compelling as an antagonist with understandable motivations.

Genuinely funny and organic humor. The jokes were not forced and were often derived from character development, not one-liners. I laughed out loud on several occasions.

CONS:

Repetitive main plot. Instead of building and thickening throughout the film, the plot was a series of redundant scenes where Thanos tries to get a stone and the heroes try to stop him.

Less engaging action sequences. There were a few good fight scenes, but some, like the ""climactic"" battle in Wakanda, were a bit underwhelming.",8

"Marvel once again proved that these films are not only made for fans, but also by them",28 April 2018,"Despite all the hype I didn't expect much from this movie - I was not a fan of Thor: Ragnarok, and the amount of the characters that were to appear in this film has made me a bit concerned. But as it turned out, I had nothing to worry about. The film was a pleasant mixture of action, tragedy, and comic relief, as all the different characters interacted with each other. The screenwriters did a great job at blending more serious universes (Captain America, Iron Man) with the humorous ones (Thor, Spider-Man, The Guardians of Galaxy), and they managed to keep them at balance throughout the whole film. Still, despite all this, their focus was put on Thanos, and they found time to explain his actions and motivation - so much needed in a character like this. Marvel has a reputation for not having believable villains, but Thanos, as well as Loki, proved this wrong. As for the actors, Chris Pratt showed he is the certified king of comedy, Zoe Saldana surprised by bringing out Gamora's sensitive site, and Josh Brolin as Thanos was just mesmerizing. Robert Downey Jr demonstrated his passion for acting and ability to blend with a role of Tony, bringing to it both seriousness and humor (you could really see he is the heart of the MCU, in this movie in particular). And Benedict Cumberbatch can act out just about anything. Marvel once again proved that these films are not only made for fans, but also by them- while watching the movie I could feel the excitement and dedication of producers as well as the rest of the crew, and it made me feel grateful, like I was also a part of the journey. And this is exactly what is so special abut Marvel - their films have that nostalgic something, where characters seemed like old friends and their adventures can easily be your own.",9

"If you thought an Avengers instalment without the helm of Joss Whedon would be concerning, don't worry. Infinity War is a blast that shows Marvel is still on top of their game",4 August 2018,"Marvel has done the inconceivable. I'm happy to admit that Avengers: Infinity War is the best team up movie in the franchise since Joss Whedon's first Avengers film. But is that too much of a good thing? The answer is a resounding yes, but in a sense that it can be let loose and do whatever it wants while strictly aiming towards fans and non-fans. It's not perfect by any means, but for the most part it is like a vending machine loaded with colourful geekiness, going full throttle on humour, enthralling set pieces and surprising moments that still thrill. Even the third act is as satisfying and effective as anything we've seen before.

The plot really kicks into gear from the get-go, not spending any time on setup and delving straight into the action. The past 18 instalments did the business of building everything up. Long story short, over 20 superheroes team up to take down the most powerful villain in the galaxy, Thanos (Josh Brolin). Rather than telling the story in predictable fashion, the script executes it unconventionally with splitting every character up into a different situation all over the place. Iron Man, Doctor Strange (the two Sherlock's: Robert Downey Jr. and Benedict Cumberbatch), the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) and Peter Parker (Tom Holland) team up, Thor (Chris Hemsworth) pairs up with the Guardians of the Galaxy, while Captain America (Chris Evans) reunites with his Civil War crew.

What makes their interactions compelling is the commitment and energy that everyone involved brings to the film. Writers Stephen McFeely and Christopher Markus structure scenes excellently, but the Russo brothers adapt them to the screen almost without a problem in sight. Where the duo's previous Marvel work were on the forefront of political seriousness, this time they channel the fanboy gleefulness that superhero films deserve, something that original director Joss Whedon had a knack for. They've just about matched him in terms of style.

Thanos is engaging but not the bad-guy-wants-to-destroy-the-world stereotype that you could imagine. He's humanly developed and masterfully designed, but perhaps not as empathetic or relatable as Killmonger in Black Panther. As the plot roaringly progresses forward, so does he.

This culmination doesn't always work. There is so much going on at once that sometimes you lose track of where you are and what's happening. The moments with underused characters frequently feel rushed, which makes scenes more appealing than others. Formulaic exposition can sometimes put the comedy to rest. But for a film as bulky as Infinity War, you can't have everything. It learns lessons from the frustrating overkill of subplots that plagued Age of Ultron and Civil War and goes for something leaner in its approach. More than a 'greatest hits' compilation, the film is the Pulp Fiction of the superhero genre. It is so good that it makes Justice League look like Batman and Robin.",8

Ignore all the other reviews,10 June 2018,"Regardless of how long it took to film, its the best heromovie out there. Lots of action-packed scenes but also very real. Credits to the masters",10
It's about as good as it had any chance to be,7 May 2018,"If you consider yourself a fan of the Marvel universe, you can stop reading here and just go watch ""Infinity War"". Of course, your mileage out of it will vary depending on your investment with the MCU, so it should be stated that while I have seen all the other movies in the franchise save for ""Doctor Strange"" (just haven't gotten around to watching it yet) and even a couple of their TV series, I wouldn't consider myself a big fan. That is to say, I don't generally rewatch most of the films in the series, though I have enjoyed all of them, some more, some less.

I was not expecting to like this movie as much as I did. Bringing together all the characters from 18 different movies, most of which I have half forgotten since their respective release dates, in a two-and-a-half-hour superhero science fiction action epic that inevitably is going to act as a jumping-of-point for another couple of sequels and also has to throw in fan service for people who have been following this franchise for ten years much more obsessively than I did, that sounds like a movie that could make my brain hurt a lot. Thankfully, ""Infinity War"" is about as good as a movie like that could realistically be. If it were any better, I would seriously have to call it a masterpiece.

Especially in its first half, ""Avengers 3"" is incredibly entertaining. The various meet-ups of Marvel characters seems fairly fluent (though there are a few convenient coincidences that drive the characters together), and the superhero banter rarely gets in the way of the story. Thanos is a good villain, and the script goes a long way in making him out as an intimidating and interesting threat.

The Russo brothers have also staged their action scenes quite well: Though there are a few moments where the camera movements were too quick for me to make out what part of the carnage I was seeing, most of the fight scenes are a lot of fun to watch, thanks to great cinematography (when it was filmed in an appropriate tempo) and choreography. For the kind of movie it is, there is even some restraint in those scenes, as the final battle doesn't outstay its welcome and most of the action scenes feature a rather small amount of villains - though fans of gigantic battle scenes obviously need not worry, there's enough of that, too.

Emotionally, the film is - as advertised - much darker than the rest of the franchise, though Team Feige is too smart to turn their flagship movie into a depressing, joyless melodrama. As in their own movies, the Guardians of the Galaxy sometimes even ruin emotional scenes for me with some ill-placed punchlines. But there's still many moments in which even amidst all the effects-heavy destruction you can see how good the actors in this movie are.

There are a couple of missteps that the movie takes, most of them all but inevitable. Not all of the 30+ main characters of the story would have needed to be in the film, and occasionally their presences are a bit distracting, if only for the fact that I found myself thinking ""What is --- doing right now?"" when a scene doesn't give them much to do and instead focuses on the bigger players. Furthermore, as was hard to avoid, making the Avengers split up into several sub-groups on their own individual quests means dividing the main story into many subplots, and, not all of them are equally interesting. Particularly frustrating is the part of the film in which a number of action scenes happen simultaneously in different places, yet as if that wasn't enough they also had to throw in a slower scene that runs concurrently (and would have fit much better into an earlier section of the film).

This film is far from perfect, but the fact that I enjoyed it at all is a minor miracle to me. If you've enjoyed (most of) the Marvel movies up to this point, it almost goes without saying that ""Avengers: Infinity War"" is a must-watch. I would not go as far with my praise as others have, but I did have a great time watching it.",7

I tried to critique it and judge it harshly and I can honestly say this film won my heart. It had that Bane from Batman feel and as much as I hate to admit it...

IT WAS EPIC !!!!!!,19 August 2018,"We are waiting for this movie and finally it cames ! Everything on it was amazing. The story and the characters perfect, the plow twist fantastic and the end........OH MY GOD !!!!! I'm looking for the part 2 !!!!",10
Deserves all the praise going to Black Panther,24 January 2019,"This is the Marvel movie that should be getting 7 Oscar nominations. This is better than Black Panther in every aspect, but it isn't a political film so it won't get the love it deserves",10

Brilliant and an epic showdown of the MCU that is breathtaking and exciting.,28 April 2018,"Avengers: Infinity War (5 out of 5 stars).

Avengers: Infinity War is an epic awesome fun superhero film that is basically the climatic battle of the MCU that has been leading up to this since the very first Iron Man movie. And surprisingly, it does not disappoint. Marvel has been doing well with its storytelling over 19 superhero movies and counting. And every one has been giving hints of the infinity stones or a big bad villain that will soon arrive like Thanos. And Thanos is the groundbreaking villain that will shake the line up of heroes and possibly changing the direction of the rest of the MCU.

The plot follows right after the events of Thor: Ragnarok. Thor and Loki and the rest of the Asgardians come across Thanos. And his desire for hunting down every Infinity Stone to annihilate half of the universe. Meanwhile on Earth, Doctor Strange and Iron Man face against danger that lands with Thano's adoptive children who are searching for the remaining stones on Earth. While, the Guardians of the Galaxy are on a race against time on trying to stop Thanos from reaching the final stone.

The plot had the Avengers getting separated into their own adventures. Yes, it involves trying to protect the stones or racing against time to find them before he gets it. You have Spider Man, Doc Strange, and Iron Man taking the fight on Thanos home planet. Rocket, Groot, and Thor searching for a weapon. The rest of the Guardians are trying to stop Thanos. Then, Captain America, Black Panther, and Scarlett Witch trying to protect the remaining stone on Earth. Characters were everywhere and had there own objective. Thanos is a villain that is set on world domination. And the writers did add a little emotion to his character and his reasoning behind his motivations of destroying everything. He is the force of nature that will test every Avenger. Sure, some may complain that there are too many characters. Yes, there is. But the writers tried to keep a well-balanced screen time on giving every character enough progression to the story. Which makes this 2 and half hour running time feeling pretty short when several characters are on a different journey that eventually crosses paths.

The visual effects and action sequences are plenty throughout and exciting. It is epic. The first ten minutes with Thanos threatening characters and attacking does leave you with chills. There are some awe, shocking, and haunting moments. And some fun humor with characters interacting with each other. When you get so many high ego heroes in one spot together can be hilarious. And than you have the Guardians which they always light up the mood. Every character has a spot to shine with the fight sequences. Then, an epic climatic battle in Wakanda. And the final moments of the film is pretty haunting. Which may leave the audience talking once the credits roll. This shocking cliffhangar does leave you hanging for the next Avengers movie. Especially, on where the direction can go next. Which is best to avoid all spoilers and media to see for yourself.

Overall, Avengers: Infinity War is a great superhero film. The plot is epic. Our heroes go through several exciting action set pieces to face against the ultimate villain. The film does have a huge cast ensemble as it is. And every one does get their fair share of screen time. Except for a couple of characters that were absent in this film (there roles are probably saved for the fourth film). The visual effects are amazing. And the action sequences are plenty throughout. There is a lot of action from beginning to end to keep you on the edge of your seat. Especially, when characters lives are at stake. The film does end with a shocking cliffhanger, which will leave you pondering on where the fourth Avengers movie will go.

I recommend seeing this film on the big screen. If you seen any of the MCU movies or the previous Avengers film. This is definitely one of the best movies and the climatic part of the Marvel universe. Also, stay tune for the final post credit scene which is an important set up for the next Marvel chapter.",10

When back in the day people used to make fun of superhero movies for their vapid storylines and characters, i actually found ironman to have a very good character development and even the 1st avengers to be entertaining and most MCU movies to have a logical flow. This movie made no sense and was just 3 hours worth of deus ex machina. This IS ther superhero movie people used to complain about.

Thanos' Movie with the Avengers just starring in it.,1 May 2018,,10
What has done been here is phenomenal,25 April 2018,"I went into this film wondering if it would suffer from some of the problems of the last Avengers film, too many stories crammed into a very short period.

Fortunately this is not a problem here, despite bringing together 10 years of marvel films they have absolutely nailed how to stop you feeling like It's all being crammed down your throat.

Like a great magic trick Infinity War didn't start April 25th it started the first time we heard about Thanos and the infinity stones, by having his story already laid out there was no need to spend half the movie explaining then motivation of the villain and would you believe it actually mean we get to see a little character development for the big purple guy.

Similarly because we already are familiar with the majority of the characters in this film we are left the best of their interactions, without having to worry about fluff.

Pacing is high intensity here, I couldn't tell you what period of time we by through the film but it seems to be secondary to everything happening, its a minor gripe but there is a strange lack of story, this sh*t is going down you best get on board with it. Again though because the story has already been explained in so many other films you just down seem to notice.

Without spoiling anything then films ending is going to leave you with a billion and one questions which will probably mean an ungodly amount of fan theories while we wait for the follow up.

Bringing this many characters together in one movie without feeling like anyone is being left short on screen time is a feat we don't get to see in cinema on this scale, if anything this is special for that reason alone.",9
THIS MOVIE NEEDS AN OSCAR.,28 April 2018,Seriously. I now know the meaning of having your jaw drop. I have never seen anything like this. This deserves honor and praise.,10
Lived up to the hype!,29 April 2018,"There was obviously a LOT of hype about this movie, but it actually lived up to it! I laughed, gasped, cheered, almost cried...It definitely helped to have seen the other Marvel movies for background, though. I loved that so many of the characters got together for the first time, and it was hilarious to see their first interactions, especially when they didn't know who each other were. The acting, special effects, music, emotion, action, humor and drama were all excellent! Can the sequel come out next weekend please?",10
Unbelievable!,20 March 2020,"Despite my contribution to the box office of this movie, I still can't believe it can actually rank 60 on the TOP250 list. Perhaps not all superhero movies end in the same way, this big villain finally won. Well, in fact, I think Thanos is very environmentally friendly. You think about it, because there are too many people, resources are limited, and the distribution is uneven, so he considers erasing part of the population randomly to achieve an even distribution of resources. The destruction of Tynos is random, you know, he is so equal hahaha",7
All Deaths,25 April 2018,,9
Surprisingly average,20 November 2018,"It took some time for me to get around this movie. Was really looking forward to it, maybe that was the reason it took so long, finding the appropriate mood and day to check it out in 4k on my tv. Finally I managed to watch IW a few days earlier and it went by rather fast and felt to be an unfinished movie, like it should be. But it felt to be lackluster too and also highly inconsistent in terms of writing. Like how the movie starts and how it progresses regarding the villain's actions. Like his personality is shifting based on the part of the movie, being overly violent, then dismissive later on. I sympathize with Thanos' character but the movie clearly wants to make him an indisputable evil lots of the time, however I look at it, and wanting you to understand him at other times, which just feels highly inconsistent once again. In addition all the new tech/powers associated with either side are breaching into the territory of 'anything goes' leaving lots of plot holes and leaning into convenient writing. There are no rules anymore, the story dictates what happens to whom which breaks the suspension of disbelief a bit. Lots of stuff is going on here, and the disjointed nature really shines throughout. There are too many people perhaps featured in this film. It might feel rushed but it definitely cannot leave enough space for development. The humour felt rather tacked-on in a lot of cases. Like almost every scene has to include a few jokes at least. It felt tiresome by the third one. Overall, without going into further rumbling, I can tell that I enjoyed IW but felt nothing especially special towards the end. The whole movie feels so unimportant and it heavily goes overboard with some (supposedly temporarily) actions. I liked Avengers much more with its more grounded approach and these huge risks, like the fate of the universe are really outdated at the moment and just make for dull movies overall.",7
"Once again, no story, just bangs and booms.",9 May 2018,"Unfortunately, computer-generated mayhem is much more important than character development.

One-liners is not good writing. There was such hope with the Dr. Strange movie and nice writing....but this ""Avengers"" film does nothing to add to any of the previous characters' story lines...especially Dr. Strange.

It's a jumble, with explosions/death/violence...with little use or reasoning behind it's constant grinding noise.

All the tears shed by actors, had no heart behind it.

It's sad when money drives a movie rather than writing.

Just because something owns Lucas Industrial Light and Magic, doesn't mean it has to be on screen at all times. I thought SE was supposed to be light-seasoning...not complete coverage.

The offering lacks in so many ways.

Sad...had high hopes.",1
A Sure Shot Take from the Marvel Studio,25 April 2018,"A movie that lived up above the hype, that's what I felt like after seeing this movie. I am huge fan of Russo brothers after seeing their epic Winter Soldier movie but felt disappointed with their take on Civil War (Strictly personal). So, in order to avoid the hype, I decided not to watch any tv spots that released, and that method worked btw.

The movie started exactly where Thor: Ragnarok finished. As usual the movie followed the same pattern that every marvel movies does. Its loaded with a lot of fun during the battles but everything is well balanced. Each character got their own screen time. If anyone ask which character scored above all it is so hard to tell. I felt like Russo brothers managed to give the importance that each character deserves. The movie is packed with a lot of Goosebumps scenes which is enough to burst out the cinema hall.

I'm not getting into the story as there is no point in explaining considering the hype but everything that a marvel fan needs is included in this movie. It took more than 10 years to see Thanos properly, but I would like to say that he just went a long way beyond my expectation. Visually the movie is top notch as we can easily identify that the studio invested a lot of money which resulted into eye popping action.

Overall in my opinion THE BEST MARVEL MOVIE ever made by the studio (Previously it was Winter Soldier). The movie got only 1 post credit scene which was scheduled at the end credits.",9
Best By Marvel,27 April 2018,,9
A ride like no other,30 April 2018,"I feel like I just gave birth to a Thanos-sized baby.

I have been physically and emotionally drained by this movie from start to finish, as it starts with an intense sense of foreboding, and carries that throughout the entire rest of the film. This is edge-of-your-seat excitement, and it is not hyperbole to say so. Around every corner is something dangerous and unpredictable, and for all the scenes that feature so many of the heroes Marvel has cultivated over the last decade, it never feels cluttered.

The Russos carefully pace the introductions and the separation of scenes, never feeling like our stay with a certain group of heroes is too long or too short. We have come a long way to get here, and in doing so, we are not cheated in any way by how the story unfolds.

Josh Brolin's Thanos is the real star of the movie. A background villain, ever looming in the shadows and on the horizon, he finally gets his moment, and garners ample screen time and development, unlike so many villains before him. His motives are laid out in an expert sort of way, much like Killmonger's in Black Panther, and it creates a richer experience. Thanos relies on Brolin's capabilities as an actor to become real, and Brolin is more than up to the challenge.

The visuals on Thanos are remarkable as well; every subtle facial tick and reaction is intensely detailed, and incredibly realistic. That sort of skill elevates the product as a whole, immersing the audience in its world seamlessly.

And then there's that ending. Oh, we must talk about that ending. There have been none like it, and the reactions in the theater when you see it will be unlike any you've ever had in a Marvel movie before. The Russos took some big chances, brought together the universe that so many before them have built, and blasted the whole thing into space for one two and-a-half hour thrill ride, with another installment to come.

Is it May 2019 yet?",10
A new high for the series.,25 April 2018,"I went into this film, not fully up to date with the MCU, not yet seeing both the newest Thor and Black panther, making me a bit weary of the movie. Yet all it did was make me want to see these even more!

This instalment was in my opinion so good, it gave me back the love for a series I started to feel was dying and oversaturated, but it was so incredibly fun. There were numerous moments I couldn't contain my laughter, just fun throughout however there was serious moments where the atmosphere changed, and you could feel and see that within the scene, making it a true movie moment, one special shutout for me was Tom Holland, who I think once again smashed his performance as Spiderman.

There was points that I thought maybe there is too many characters involved, however it was pulled off nicely to allow the story to develop but allowed everyone to get adequate screen time, so you didn't feel like anyone was really missed out. A large portion of the movie was a build for the third act as well as the second part, but well worth it. It gave characters who have not previously met time to connect and gain that bond which I thought was nice.

Overall the movie provided what anyone wants from a superhero movie, action and plenty of it, as well as plenty of fun and humour. Overall it was one of my favourite within the series so far, defiantly giving me a sense of faith within the series for the future and what is yet to come.",9
Excellent all round,1 May 2018,Thanos was incredible throughout and so impressed with how they managed to advance so many character arcs in this movie for the MCU moving forward. Thor with the guardians was so well done and something I would love to see more of. Who knew Thor would be the funniest Avenger??,10

Avengers: Infinity War (2018),20 January 2020,"Directed by Anthony Russo & Joe Russo. Starring Josh Brolin, Robert Downey Jr., Zoe Saldana, Chris Hemsworth, Chris Pratt, Benedict Cumberbatch, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Evans, Tom Holland, Elizabeth Olsen, Paul Bettany, Scarlett Johannson, Dave Bautista, Pom Klementieff, (voice) Bradley Cooper. (PG-13)

The first half of the Marvel Cinematic Universe's grand smackdown finds cosmic supervillain Thanos (Brolin) collecting infinity stones to give himself the ultimate power to wipe out half of the intelligent life in the universe. Depicting the efforts of some fifty or more characters across several storylines in both outer space and on Earth, this exhausting ""event movie"" is so relentless yet dramatically diffuse that it's difficult to engage with anything besides individual moments: a snappy quip here, a brief break from the fever pitch for reflection there. Requiring the absorption of about a dozen-and-a-half prior movies to be able to clearly follow what's happening, the effort lacks proper isolation, resulting in what feels like an incomplete film (and experience); it even opens with a mise-en-scène and ends on a cliffhanger. Despite two-and-a-half hours of action, most of the cast get only a few minutes of screen time to leave a mark (even major players from previous films, like Chadwick Boseman and Don Cheadle, don't manage much more than glorified cameos), but Brolin does manage to create a formidable yet conflicted--even humanized--enemy, which only makes his decisions more startling to behold. Has all the fingerprints of filmmaking-by-committee, but it should still satisfy most fans to at least some degree.

PARTY!,14 June 2018,"Imagine yourself being one of the characters. Can you see the logic? Can you feel the motivation of both protagonists and villains? How would you feel about the Avengers' choices and dialogs? No? No! Just no... No effort implemented in making of this rubbish. Defying physics and common sense, defying background story that was building up for 10 years. A bunch of ppl runnung around having fun, looked like a party movie.

It was like a potpourri: we've recently seen every scene in a bunch of another super hero movies. Even the final sequence is similar to X-men. All those ""professional critics"" who write these prepaid positive reviews for yet another Disney's garbage should be ashamed of themselves. Is there nothing saint left in the world? The most hyped and messy movie of our time.

Was Thanos making a party machine all this time? Cause random (not. check hero rating) people are getting turned into confetti with expensive and safe explosions on the green screen - very underwhelming and lame.",1
The Human brain is not ready for this!,30 April 2018,"I watched Avengers at Midnight on release day. I have not stopped thinking about it since. My life has been consumed in way I didn't think it could be. I thought I was stronger than that. I will be going back to see this again this week, No other film in recent memory has made even consider doing that, let alone opening up an account on a generic review site just to help expel some adrenaline. I know reviews are an opinion, but if this film isn't a 10 across the board I feel a sadness for the people who voted lower, I fear what they are searching for in life does not exist.

Doesn't get bigger than this. Get a popcorn and watch the movie. Most importantly, enjoy!",10
THE INFINITY FUN IS HERE-NO SPOILERS,1 May 2018,"Ever since the movie title was announced , i was super excited to see it....But this movie exceeded all my expectations. Right from the start of the film,there was not a single moment when my eyes were off the screen.

The C.G.I. and 3-D effects of the movie were fantastic.You are glued to your seats for the whole run time. The comic timing was really great and some scenes were quite hilarious.The film was a mixture of action,thrill,comedy and emotions.

Thanos appears to be very powerful and in some scenes i felt emotionally connected to him as well. I believe thanos is the best villain in MCU till date.Thanks to the great acting of Josh Brolin. All the superheroes are given acceptable screen time. Action scenes are brilliant. After the end of the movie, i felt like-Why the movie has ended..The ending might disappoint some people.I will not give any spoilers here. This film deserves to be watched at IMAX. Waiting for part-II....",10
Movie for the ages,5 May 2018,"This movie is a masterpiece, what makes this movie great is balance. Russo brothers did a great job featuring Thanos , all while giving proper shine to each character.

Amazeballs in Space,27 April 2018,"Wow. I will not give any spoilers away. I will say that i have seen almost every Marvel film and this was the best ever. It blew all other Marvel and D.C. films out of the water. The Visual Effects, the story, the acting (except Ruffalo), the Easter Eggs, the humour, the feels and everything else was Király (Hungarian for king or awesome).

If you do not think this is the best Marvel film, then you obviously not a true film critic. Or maybe you have different taste than I do.

I cannot wait to see it again and that is a rare statement for me.",10
Come together ... right now,5 August 2018,"Well the movie we've been waiting for ... years! It's finally here and it doesn't dissapoint at all. You may nitpick and there are things to critisize as with all movies, but as a Universe Marvel did a fantastic job, setting characters up and giving us something to look for. So even the smallest things can make you chuckle (if you are like me and into that sort of stuff), like Groot and Captain America introducing themselves to each other. It's a character moment, but it's also as funny as it can be. And it is grounded into what we know about them and their attitude.

So even when you have all that mayhem and all that fights going on, there is always time for other things. Quirky things, intelligent things and not just necessarily just social commentary (see Black Panther), but also dialog like the ""made up words"" argument (very fine moment indeed). And again, I'm just giving you some simple moments, that really define how well thought out this all is. Not afraid to be self deprecating at times either.

If you are able to avoid spoilers, please do and watch this to be surprised, to laugh, maybe even cry a little bit, but more important of all be entertained! I guess having to watch a few movies before this may seem like a chore for some, but once you start them and are not too negative about it, you will enjoy them ... just watched Ant Man and the Wasp and that was a hoot/blast too. But now I have to wait until next year ... for Captain Marvel and the ""conclusion"" of this ... I have some ideas where it might go ... By the way there is ""only"" one scene after the movie is over and it's after the credits ... sometimes you have to have room to breathe, so right decision!",9

It's better than 'JUSTIC LEAGUE' at least.,27 April 2018,"'AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR': Four Stars (Out of Five)

The third installment (not counting 'CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR') in the blockbuster superhero franchise, based on the Marvel Comics' characters. This one has the Avengers teaming up with the Guardians of the Galaxy, to stop Thanos from collecting all of the Infinity Stones so he can bend reality to his will. The movie was directed by Anthony and Joe Russo (who also both co-directed 'CAPTAIN AMERICA: WINTER SOLDIER' and 'CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR'), and it was scripted by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely (who also both co-wrote all of the 'CAPTAIN AMERICA' movies). It stars Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, Chris Pratt, Chadwick Boseman, Tom Holland, Benedict Cumberbatch, Mark Ruffalo, Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista, Scarlett Johansson, Paul Bettany, Elizabeth Olsen, Don Cheadle, Anthony Mackie, Sebastian Stan and the voices of Josh Brolin, Bradley Cooper and Vin Diesel. It's received mostly positive reviews from critics, and it's expected to break all kinds of records at the Box Office of course. The movie is a pretty epic action flick, but it's a little light on actual character development and meaningful story.

The story begins two years after the end of 'CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR', and the Avengers are still not on speaking terms. Thanos (Brolin) has come to earth to collect the last of the Infinity Stones, which will allow him to form a gauntlet that can bend reality to his will. Hulk (Ruffalo) has arrived just before him, to warn Tony (Downey Jr.) about his plans. At the same time Thor (Hemsworth) meets the Guardians of the Galaxy, in space, and the Avengers must later team-up with them in order to stop Thanos, and save the universe.

The film definitely has a great epic feel to it, and look, and the action scenes are spectacular. There's way too many characters in the movie though, and each one has their own little story; which when added all together makes the whole film feel kind of pointless and empty. I'm sure nerd comic book lovers will still love it, and on a purely superficial/technical level it's quite a film-going experience. In the end though, it's all style over substance, and it's kind of like movie junk food with no real value. It is better than 'JUSTIC LEAGUE' at least though.",8
The Best of the Best,14 May 2018,"Generally with superhero movies you know your hero will win, and as a result the viewer couldn't care less about the story. Why care when you know it will work out in the end? Infinity war tropes that stereotype and gives the viewer new interest into the super hero world that may not always end with puppies and rainbows.

This is a great movie that tells an in-depth story line of interpersonal relationships while maintaining the action of the story, something extremely hard to do. Thanos was a well constructed villain who truly did make you afraid for the heroes we hope will prevail.

This one will go down in the record books.",10

"Alas, I can only give ten stars.",30 April 2018,"The screen went black, the lights in the theater came up a little, and the credits began to scroll as over 100 people sat in quietly. We all sat in stunned silence staring at the screen after having witnessed the culmination of 10 years and 18 films all leading to this moment. Had Marvel pulled any punches? No. Was the hype real? Oh, yes. Is there a way out? There must be, but only the next films will determine what that 1 way in 14,600,005 is.

A few things to help you:

First, is the movie hard to follow? If you haven't seen the previous 17 films in the ""franchise,"" probably a bit, if only due to the large number of main characters and their relationships to each other and the storyline in this film.

Second, is there humor? Yes.

Third, are there good action sequences? Hell, yes.

Fourth, do main characters die? Yes, and I won't say who, how, or how many.

Fifth, is Thanos a good villain? Yes, a very good villain whose story you learn throughout the film and whose motives are clear, if not crazy.

Sixth, is there an after credits scene? Yes, one, at the very end of the credits, followed by an on screen statement.

Seventh, would I want to see this film more than once? I know I do, if only to spot the tie ins to previous films that I didn't catch the first time.

Eighth, is the film emotionally draining? Yes, if you have seen the previous films and have any attachment to the characters in those films, you may be disturbed at the way this film leaves off.",10

WTF DID JUST HAPPEN......!!!!!,27 April 2018,"Don't listen to reviews, go off the internet even don't watch the trailers and don't contact many people, coz this is a movie u should only watch as a comic book fan or an mceu fan if you have followed their storylines until this point. Watch it just for the pure joy of being at the movies, no pros no cons no analysis, just watch it for once and sit back for a while to just feel the amount of emotions run through you. It's an exceedingly overwhelming movie. And all credit must go to the makers of this movie here Marvel, Russo brothers, marcus and mcfeely, and all the technical staff. This is a huge dream not only we as audiences watched but Marvel also watched, which came alive in a grand fashion here on celluloid. Movie delivers on all aspects ,expectations, excitement, thrills and even a lot of chills. As lots of surprises and shocks coming your way so, don't try to figure out much coz you won't be able to guess, unless you want spoilers. Trust me it will affect you very deeply but for good for the most part.",10
A lot of people think The Room is superior to Infinity War,16 May 2018,"So there's a trend lately with all these 1/10 reviews bashing IW, especially by saying it doesn't belong in the top 250. Firstly they don't understand how IMDB's rating system works, fanboyism can't get movies in the top 250. Secondly, and this is the funniest part, at the same time they think this movie is not better than e.g. LOTR:TTT (I don't either) they also with their 1/10 votes think IW is WORSE than The Room (3.6/10) or Britney Spears' Crossroads (3.4/10). They must think these movies are awesome compared to IW. Go watch some really bad movies and get some perspective.

Now for the review part. IW was really really good, a spectacle. It was so intense that it took me hours to settle down, it might even have been too much. When I have extremely high expectations it is very rare that I'm 100% satisfied, but after one viewing I had nothing important to criticize. However I always need a second viewing before having my final opinion so I'll rate this 8/10 for now but it will probably land in 9/10. Don't miss the opportunity to watch it in theaters, even if you don't like it, you will miss an historic movie event.",9
A Fun Ride,15 August 2019,"This is not one of the best superhero movies for me, probably because I'm not a big fan of putting so many characters from the ""universe"" in one movie, be that dc or marvel. After getting over myself and the fact that spiderman is in space... I watched it for what it was, a fun special effects action movie of good vs evil. It is definately evil they are fighting...

A little long perhaps, but cramming all of the characters in here from avengers, guardians of the galaxy and so on, then it has to be.

It's a fun ride and worth a watch. Whilst a good stand alone movie, it does set you up for part two, even referring to ""End Game"". So despite its flaws I'll certainly watch Endgame.",7
Justification,20 June 2018,"To all the reviewers who are giving this a 1 star because ""this has too much visual effects"" and ""not enough character development"" This review is for you! Avengers Infinity War consists of a talking raccoon, a humanoid tree, a dude that turns green that weighs about 1000lbs of muscle, a mad Titan from a completely different planet a floating wizard. Some of the scenes occur on different planets, in space, and on a spaceship. So when you complain about this movie having too much visual effects, unfortunately you just failed to understand the movie itself. Now to address the complaints about the lack of character development, if you knew anything about character development, these characters developed from different movies, Captain America in Captain America: the first avenger, Ironman in the first Ironman movie, formation of Guardians of the Galaxy in their own movie, Dr. Strange from his own movie and all the sidekicks were all introduced on other Marvel movies so all these characters are well developed. Avengers Infinity War was never made to develop characters, it is the culmination of these characters to fight a super villain. So if you're gonna criticize this movie because it lacks character development and its nothing but visual effects, KID, you have no clue what you are talking about.",10
"A little of everything, makes for an average affair",27 December 2018,"I've enjoyed most of the Marvel Universe films but I wasn't as taken with this, basically a little of everyone's favourite characters, but equally not enough of everyone's favourite characters combined to make a slightly less than memorable movie.

One thing though, this was a movie with a message that humanity cannot continue wasting the resources of this planet or face the loss of at least half of what we have on this little planet of ours. Credit for that as we need to wake up to a very harsh future if we carry on as is.",6
Frustrating and Hopeless,6 May 2018,"Dear Users, In my experience of last fifty years - this is the worst movie. It has no consistent plot - no direction - no editing and most importantly no morale. You will be feeling thoroughly cheated while watching this movie.",1
Marvels Best,30 April 2018,Hands down the best Marvel movie Yet. So much to see and take in. Stories woven together in fine style. Visually a delight to watch.,10
Simply amazing!,29 April 2018,The Russo brothers did it again! I was blown away by this movie. Every character had their screen time and interactions between them were very good. As a huge fan of Spider-Man I can say that the Iron-Spider suit in the movie looked awesome. Thanos is probably the best marvel villain and the CGI looked on point. Overall this might be the best MCU film up to date!,10
Best Superhero movie ever!!!!,22 May 2018,"This movie did everything, what superhero movie should do. I love the third act and every action scene. Some characters didn't get much screen time than others, but hey thats understandable, because in this film there are so many characters. This movie gets 10/10",8
Cinematic Masterpiece,30 April 2018,This movie still has me in awe of its greatness. I absolutely loved this film and so happy to be on this thrill ride. Avengers Infinity War doesn't disappoint in fact it by far exceeded expectations. Thank you to the cast and crew for this amazing epic movie.,10
Everything a movie should be,30 April 2018,"This movie exceeded all my expectations. It was hilarious, action packed, emotional, devastating, everything a movie should be. After the movie ended, everyone in the cinema literally sat there for 10 minutes thinking what just happened. Rarely does a movie have such impact on the audiences. I am looking forward to the next one even more now.",10
"A very good film, but not perfect",24 May 2018,"There were a lot of great things about this film, Thanos being the highlight of the film, but still it did feel a little crammed at times. Some things about this film were overdramatised And it felt at times there was too much going on.

Saying that though on a pure enjoyment and plot scale this film does almost everything right. It was not predictable which meant there was genuine surprise for the plot twists. Overall Marvel have done a good job with this movie bar a few details but still a great movie overall.",9
Infinity War in 6 Easy Steps!,18 August 2018,,7
It looks the Star Wars fans have turned up with 1 star reviews!,11 June 2018,"I have been anticipating this film for an enjoyable MCU 10 years. I was a little concerned as I wasn't overly impressed with the rather lackluster Black Panther (or the Lion King retelling) which suffered from over enthusiastic use of obvious CGI and suffered a Mary Sue character (T'Challa's sister if you hadn't guessed)

However Infinity War was absolutely EPIC. Finally a decent MCU villain, fully rounded, deep and gained my sympathy despite my best intentions. A fair few surprises and an absolutely storming finale.

I get the feeling Ant Man and the Wasp is going to struggle fill the gap to Infinity War 2 (or whatever it's called).",10

Great,29 April 2018,We have been waiting for a long time for this and obviously worth it.,10
Ignore the butthurt DC crybabies-This movie is Fantastic!,1 May 2018,"Some people're annoyed that they got to see no introduction to their superheroes.MCU has been running for a decade through our solo superhero movies.What more introduction do you need? This movie first starts from where Thor Ragnarok ended.But some people just wanted to ride the hype train so they went to see the Infinity War without a single knowledge of Marvel Cinematic Universe. Avengers Infinity War is amazing.Thanos and his black order perfectly lived up to their hype.Get ready to see a rejuvenated form of Dr Strange,Thor and Wanda.Whole theatre was exploding during Thor's entry in Wakanda.The humour is also perfectly executed.The Wakandans including T'Challa may have a very short role but they've still managed to make this awesome. If you havent watched the movie already,trust me,this is all worth it.Enjoy it in your nearest theatre with your friends and families!",10

"A MASTERPIECE, WHAT THE GODFATHER SHOULD HAVE BEEN! HATERS ARE NOT SMART",23 May 2018,"As a cinephile since I'm a little little kid, and being 28 y.o. now, I have to say this is THE BEST FILM ever made, to the date, EVERYTHING IS PERFECTION, the script, the production, the cinematography, the jokes, the acting, the characters, the construction of every aspect and hue of the plot, the music, a perfect example of that human beings even we have differences, we are all in the same side, and we have to let those differences aside and join to defend what is right, no matter what, it's an example of courage, human values, sacrifice for others, IT'S A PERFECT EXAMPLE to teach and educate kids, about how important is the respect to each other, MAGNIFICENT! it leaves you a message, a beautiful and powerful message, unlike the over-hyped GODFATHER, that doesn't leaves you anything except a bad taste about deaths and crime, no teaching, nothing.Avengers: Infinity War It's like the perfect movie I've been expecting all my life without even knowing it, 10 OUT OF 10, MASTERPIECE.Period.",10

infinity war,1 May 2018,Wow this was very traumatising I can't wait to watch it 15 more times,10
"""Opinions are like..",23 May 2018,"..subjective."" Would be the obvious answer. Looking through the review section I hardly see any numbers between 1 and 10. So let me get my armchair and psychoanalyze this real quick. Some people love to love, some people love to hate. My rating would be 72 out of 100 by the way. I admittedly enjoy the MCU as it has thus far served me with some unpretentious colorful entertainment and some neat characters. They treat these characters respectfully and fairly uncompromising throughout various different writers, directors and styles. It's a unique enterprise that is usually quite enjoyable. But are any of those movies actually worthy of a 10 out of 10 based on a scale that includes all films ever made. Absolutely not! Would most film buffs resent my 8 out of 10 rating. Definitely! But opinions really are quite subjective and I rate movies based on competence and entertainment value. The latter of which is where all the guilty pleasures fit in. I was damn surprised that this movie didn't turn out a cluster. It really should have, considering it's large cast and insane plot. But it feels very well paced for the most part and flows pretty well. And the big climax of the movie feels actually climactic within the entire MCU. Marvel Fans won't be disappointed. I know I wasn't. And I'm not a fan of anything. Because fandom is for babies.",7
Really poor implementation of The Avengers' Characters,1 May 2018,,2
Speechless...,5 May 2018,"This film could have failed in many ways, especially if the writers dulled the stakes, but that is the opposite of what they did. This film is tense, dark, hopeless, yet humorous. The film takes risks that will no doubt leave audiences shocked and by doing this alone has made it a revolutionary comic book movie. The characters, the action, the acting, and the setpieces are all done marvelously, and the villain, Thanos, is one of the most intense and frightening villains in Marvel film history and possibly in Cinema as a whole. Whenever he is onscreen you feel as though all hope is lost and that our heroes are in great peril, making this a thrill ride of a film that must be seen. I was not expecting what I got, but leaving the theater, I was absolutely speechless.",10
What I expected and more....,1 May 2018,What a movie .... can't explain with word... just dint want the movie to end....,10
Simply amazing!,1 May 2018,,10
The summer movie season is starting off great this year,29 April 2018,"Definitely a return to form for Marvel with Infinity War, but I predict the next movie will be a bit of a letdown as the conflict with Thanos has to be resolved. If you've read the comic, you probably have an idea what will happen, and I think it will probably end up being lame. Still, it was a well-made movie.

I'm just getting sick of Black Panther and Wakanda though. Here you have an black superhero and his nation, which supposedly is some sort of breakthrough for black moviemaking and black comic book superheroes(laughably not true) yet the world of Wakanda is chock full of insulting, backwards stereotypes of African people in spite of the fact their society is so advanced, an alien race can't even break through its force field. Seeing the Wakandans use spears, dressed in tribal gear, just makes my eyes roll as well. Shuri is also the smartest person in Wakanda, dare I say, the only person in Wakanda who seems to be smart enough to engineer anything in spite of the fact their society was technologically advanced for decades, if not centuries. The stupidity of Wakanda is just infuriating and juvenile and I wish they would clean it up in future movies. I just refuse to watch any more Black Panther movies if they are made because I cannot stand anything about it.

Also, the balance of power between characters just isn't logical. You will have one character like Hulk get the snot beat out of them, yet Captain America or Iron Man will easily go toe to toe with Thanos and his goons and put up a good fight. The one fight scene in Scotland was really bad; Vision and Scarlet Witch get the snot beat out of them, yet Black Widow, Captain America and Falcon easily make short work of Thanos's goons and run them off? This could have used some work but wasn't enough to ruin the film.

I highly recommend this movie. It is a bit long though, but I never checked my watch.",9
What's up with all the negative reviews?,30 April 2018,"I don't get what all the negative reviews are about. People seem to dislike the elements of homour and/or the length of the film and/or there being too many sidestories to keep up with.

To adress the first critique: This particular brand of humour, with random jokes thrown into the movies to make it more lighthearted, is the whole reason the adaptation of Marvel movies from the comics have transitioned so well the past 10 years. If you look at the movies produced before the whole sucess story of the MCU: X-men last stand, the first 3 Spiderman movies, the fantastic four movie and so on, the one thing they all lacked was the humour. There has to be some kind of humour in superhero-movies, as well as some kind of self awareness, otherwise the movies come of as comletely lame. I mean, we have people in spandex running around and calling themselves pretty corny nick-names - it just can't be all seriousness and action.

As for the second complaint, ragarding the running time being too long, I don't think you can cram so many characters into one movie without making it at least 2+ hours long. Otherwise people would just say that it felt rushed instead.

Thirdly, I understand if the different characters and plot can seem too much if you haven't really kept up with any of the previous Marvel movies. But if you have, I see no problem in understanding eveything that goes on in the movie. They even make it clearer by writing in text on the screen where the story takes place.

I don't think this is a 10 star movie simply beause it's cut in half, there being a second part and all, but it surely deserves more than a 7 star rating.",8
Grabs you by surprise,23 August 2018,"Movie is eye-catching from start to finish, it's packed with action and with all our beloved characters we got to meet through the years. It's different from the comics, but in a good way, story fits this specific universe, and Thanos, in my opinion, is much more complex and interesting character than who got to meet in the comics. Visuals are well done, music is thrilling, especially at the end, crossovers are done in a great way, everything fits and connects the way it should.",10
End Is Near !!!,30 April 2018,,7
Mindblowing Movie!,29 April 2018,"It beautiful visual effects, fantastic directing, emotional, epic, funny, fun, dark, intense, etc. The movie is mostly action and adventure so there technically isn't a build up. Instead the movie starts off with a bang all the way until the end of the film. It has a balance of almost every genre and the Villain was extremely well written with a reasonable backstory behind his name.",10
nerds will like it,2 September 2022,"It took me a few years to see each of the Avengers movies, so I'm only getting around to this one. We have here the MCU continuing with ""Avengers: Infinity War"". T'Challa and his cohorts get added to the mix in a battle against the ruthless Thanos.

Basically, if you've seen any superhero flick from the 21st century, then you should know what to expect here. For me, it's neat seeing the Scarlet Witch and her robot companion, as they got a TV series last year called ""Wandavision"", where they exist in a number of TV settings representing different eras.

In short, if you're anything like the characters on ""The Big Bang Theory"", then you'll enjoy this movie. Stan Lee's cameo, plenty of CGI, and all manner of battle scenes make it one for the attendees of ComicCon. Improbable but harmless.",6
Oh brother....,2 July 2018,,1
Wow!,27 April 2018,Action packed movie that seems like it was an hour long,10
S tier film,13 June 2023,"This film is beautifully crafted and handled with so much love and care, this film does everything correctly, the pacing on this film is not slow and is a moderate speed which helps the audience keep up with every character, Thanos was a threatening villain, the fact that he wants to have the power of the gods to balance out the universe and would kill anyone who steps in his way or is linked with the infinity stones, he also doesn't show to be physically powerful but also mentally, he is incredibly intelligent almost that it shocked Tony Stark, the cinematography in this film is also just beautiful, there is no bad shot in this film at all everything looks high quality, now the CGI, Marvel is known to be in love with CGI but in this film it's a different breed, everything when it comes to the costumes, Thanos' minions and catastrophic events in the film looks so real, it definitely shows that Marvel used up most of their budget on this film, every character is kept true and loyal to their previous films, The guardians were an amazing treat to watch apart from that one scene with Star Lord and Thanos, if you know you know, Spider-Man ditching a school activity to help deal with the threat that Thanos brought upon earth also shows how the Russo brothers kept the best details of the character, The avengers whilst seperated also have their chances to shine, Captain America and his team especially showing us the aftermath of Civil war by just showing us how the characters now act and look is an amazing detail that i personally love, The battle in Wakanda is the best scene in this film personally, everything in this scene is just cracked to 100%, I love this scene and Black panther yelling out Wakanda forever sends chills down my spine because of how amazing the line was performed by Chadwick Boseman.",10
10/10,19 August 2022,,10
Perfectly balanced as all superhero movies should be!,27 March 2019,"Avengers 3 is a cinematic masterpiece. You can call it the ""Star Wars"" of the new generation. Everybody, who is starring in this movie gives a wonderful performance. The movie is so good, that it is impossible to be not entertained. Avengers 3 is the best superhero movie ever. The only superhero movie, that can top this, is maybe Avengers 4.

-PERFECT, (INFINITE) CHARACTERS Every character is fully developed. Every character, who was build up until now, carries more weight in this movie. The communication between our favourite characters is displayed in a special way.

-PERFECT CGI I really liked the CGI. The CGI was better used than in other superhero movies today. Thanos really looked like a realistic alien. Even though some people called his animation low-budget, i think that Thanos looks great.

-A PERFECT VILLAIN This is the best villain ever in a Marvel Cinematic Universe-Movie ever. He has great motivations. He does not just want to eliminate people, because he wants to. He has reasons behind this. Of course, he is radical and has a wrong view on things, but there were some moments, where i empathized with him.

-PERFECT, ENTERTAINING STORYLINE Every little bit of this movie is entertaining. You can watch it more than a thousand times and you can not get bored.

All in all: A PERFECT MOVIE

""This movie, I like it! ANOTHER!"" - Me after watching it",10
Fantastic interpretation of the The Infinity Gauntlet comic.,20 May 2018,"While I am a fan of comics I never was of its cinematic counterpart because almost always movie producdion houses and directors were not brave enough to adapt the movies like they were in the comics or close nough, in fear of not capturing the attention of the normal movie going masses. These last 16 movies by marvel decided to take a brave step in the right direction and expand on the comic universe in order to adapt some of the amazing and complex story lines from the comics. All 16 movies prior infonity wars led to the Infinity gauntlet event and slowly built up the plot for it in the backround of each movie. And finally with Avangers: Infinity War one of the most iconic battles in the marvel universe was fantastically adapted on the big screen. Avengers: Infinity War is the best movie of its genre, and the best comic adaption along with The Watchmen. I urge every Comic fan to watch this movie and be absolutely blown away. It blew all my expectations trough the roof!",10
Not bad!,24 February 2019,I'm fed up with CGI superhero films but this addition is not bad at all. I didn't see the ending coming!,7
best marvel movie ever made,28 April 2018,,10
Why always like DC,28 May 2018,"Maybe my review is really different from another perception. I always watch that Marvel movies (under Walt Disney Company) is similar with DC Movies.. like Avenger Civil War is similar with Batman VS Superman, and now Infinity War, that Thanos search power stone is similar like Steppenwolf search Mother's Box to accumulate his power to become unlimited.. but we should admitted that Marvel is more attractive than DC",6
"If you've not seen all the other films, it can be a bit confusing.",11 May 2018,"I think there's waaayyy too many 10/10s here. I saw it on the IMAX.

This film did not blow me away. A 10/10 film should be able to stand alone as a great film; this clearly wasn't that.

Due to the fact there were so many characters, you couldn't help but feel the rush to make sure everyone had screentime and that was at the expense of storytelling, which as you'll see below, it could have done with a bit more of.

As I hadn't watched all the other relevant marvel films, I didn't quite understand some of the character's strained relationships with each other - they could have at least done a flashback...but then I guess there'd be even less time for storytelling!

It was a 'good' film, but I regret going to see it at the cinema. Good Netflix fodder.",5
Infinity War The Most Intense Marvel Movie Yet,3 May 2018,"Marvel's Infinity War is the most complex and intense movie of the Marvel Universe. This film with its numerous heros may seem pretty challenging to follow if you're not a hardcore Marvel fan. However, even though there were 19 movies before this one, Infinity War did a fantastic job of bringing all the movies together into a plot that even a first time Marvel movie watcher could understand and enjoy. As said before Infinity War, movie number 19 of this connected movie franchise, has brought all of their heros and movies together seamlessly into an all out war against one very powerful super villain named Thanos. It's very entertaining to see how the groups of heros interact with one another. Black Panther and Captain America gives the viewers someone to look up to and respect. Dr. Strange and Tony Stark's egotistical outlook on themselves really make a good comedic relief between the many intense fight scenes. The biggest comedic relief however comes from the Guardians of the Galaxy ranging from their old music classics, to their funky way of running their operations really gives the audience something to laugh about amongst the chaos, the chaos of course being Thanos. There is so much background to this villain's rise for power so I'll sum it all up for you. Thanos is on a quest to find 6 gems. Each gem, even though they look like something out of a bedazzling kit you got when you were eight, hold very powerful and specific powers that ultimately will let him kill off half of the universe's population. This is the biggest, baddest, and scariest villain yet, not just because his goal is to wipe out half of the universe's populace, but because he is convinced that he is the good guy. He believes that he is doing the universe a favor by making the hard decisions for it. By killing half of the universe, it makes room for more people to have resources and food to go around ultimately leading to the survival of millions of different species. Obviously the Avengers and all the other heros don't agree with this, and tirelessly try to keep the stones away from Thanos. I will not spoil the movie for you but the ending is much more grim than you would expect and leaves you with more questions than answers. That fact may leave some people metaphorically with a bad taste in their mouth, but we must remember that this is the Marvel universe and not everything is as it seems. So in the meantime appreciate the fact the Marvel's Infinity War has the biggest wow factor in the Marvel Universe so far.",9
No reason to be underrated,18 November 2018,"Doesn't have to be underrated only because it's a unrealistix sci-fi super hero movie for kids (and adults as well). It's a good movie without prejudice. Hail Marvel, rip Stan Lee.",10
Good superhero movie,5 January 2023,"I enjoyed watching this movie, as Thanos was certainly a good villain as he provided a good motive in searching for the stones. The Marvel superheroes worked well together, and I enjoyed seeing Captain America, Doctor Strange, Spiderman, Black Panther, the Guardians of the Galaxy team, and. Falcon among others working together. Only criticism:too many lengthy and unnecessary battles, especially towards the end. I still liked it though. The battle scenes and other parts of the movie were still exciting, and the plot was good. I loved Doctor Strange and Thanos's scenes. This was a terrific entry in the Marvel Comics movie universe. I liked it and guarantee you will too.

Marvels peak,18 August 2022,Infinity war was one of the most entertaining hilarious films that exists. This is marvels best movie. Looking at films like Black widow or shows like ms. Marvel it is clear to see that marvel knew what they were doing but somewhere along the way they generated the idea that these movies are about flashy fights and rushed projects like eternal marvel needs to get their act together or thy are going to lose the interest of there most dedicated fans.,10
great,21 July 2020,,8
good,9 January 2021,"They did a wonderful job with the villain. Sound effects were good. A variety of characters. It felt like they were trying to mash a bunch of political views into the story though which felt forced and sort of ruined it because people are trying to enjoy the fantasy movie. Eg: girl power thing, the white and black thing. Very uncomfortable for some viewers. Would of been nice to focus on the story",6
Unbelievable.,28 August 2018,"It's not often I write reviews but I had to for this unbelievable masterpiece. It had me riveted from start to finish and made me forget all of the troubles I currently have in my life. I couldnt wait to see all the amazing characters one by one and for the next bit of amazing action, one after another and so relentless. I get bored very easily so when something can keep me so mesmerised for so long it has to be good. My only complaint is that I have to wait far too long to find out what happens. This is by far the best super hero film ever made and for me one of the best films I've ever seen. I'd give it 20 out of 10 if I could. Fantastic. It makes the DC films (which I like) (I'm a big superman fan) look like cheap made for TV rubbish.",10
Far more should have been left on the cutting room floor,22 September 2018,"Way too much i.e. endless fighting, CGI expressions take far longer to develop than human, barely any semblance of a plot, whether Save the Cat! or Hero's Journey it's weak and disorganized. And despite another reviewer claiming I'm ""not worth listening to,"" I have seen all other Marvel movies, many of them multiple times, and this one twice. The first and third Iron Man movies were far more enjoyable. If they'd left another hour's worth on the cutting room floor, this could have been a significantly better movie.",6

They acquire the rights of a universe with some superheroes en then they release 5 superhero movies a year that are complete and utter trash but its fanbase will love it no matter wat. now a cgi war movie (were we all now how of how it will end, it doesn't becouse Disney will keep spitting out these movies until marvel fanboys stop going to these trash movies.) Is considerd better than movies like Silence of the Lambs, Se7en, forrest gump and Leon??? Well if this is the case than i will leave this site and never come back becouse i use this site to see if a movie is worth seeing.

Avengers: Infinity War was a fantastic movie,27 November 2018,"The movie, Avengers: Infinity War, is one of the greatest Marvel movies ever made. The movie consisted of tons of action, perspective changes and plot twists. The movie also had a lot of Marvel superheroes. Secondly, there was 10 years and 18 movies building up to this movie. Lastly, Infinity Wars made a grand total of 2.048 billion dollars. I think we can all agree that a movie with plot twists and a lot of action can be extremely good. These additions can not only make the movie more enjoyable, but they also help contribute to the amount of movie it makes. Let's look at the 2.048 billion dollars Infinity Wars made.Movies are filled with different elements. Plot twists, perspective changes, action, they all contribute to making the movie a great film.Infinity Wars consists of all these attributes, and more. Also, a movie that has had 18 other Marvel movies building up to it, it's bound to be good. Lastly, a movie that has made over 2 BILLION dollars is undeniably worth watching.",9
Best Movie Ever!!!,12 August 2018,This movie is far better than Justice league. This Movie's storyline was awesome and the characters deaths were so emotional. I hope they return in Avengers 4,10
One of the Greatest Superhero Movies of All-Time,19 April 2021,"This movie is undoubtedly one of the best superhero movies of all-time. Everything about it is just unprecedented...before this movie, I didn't think a team up like this was even possible. And I am so surprised that an Avengers movie with the villain as the main character can be so entertaining. This is also the funniest Avengers movie, in my opinion, mostly due to the Guardians of the Galaxy meeting with Iron Man and friends. Overall, this was a great movie and one of the greatest movies of the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe.

After 10 years of slowly building a massive ensemble of unique characters, it all culminated into an action packed, fun, adventure with actual stakes and a fantastic ending.

Every franchise, Including Disney themselves, have been trying and failing to capture a glimpse of the success that Marvel's Avengers accomplished, and I think that says something to the immense difficulty of pulling something like this off.

No scene dragged, and everyone got the exact amount of screen time that they needed.

Even if we wanted something like this again, it would take years just to develop. Hopefully we see it again someday.",9

"""Avengers: Infinity War: An Overrated Marvel Movie with Cheap Thrills and Poor Editing""",25 April 2023,,7
Too much and not enough at the same time,11 May 2018,"I'm probably going against the general reception for this film but for me this film was just too much and not enough at the same time. Marvel fans will probably disagree with me. There is a star studded cast and clearly a lot of money has been spent to make this film a real spectacular.

However, for me there were too many obvious special effects, too many leading characters and far far far too much action. It just keeps coming at you relentlessly.

At the same time there's not enough real story and characterisation, not enough time to take in what's going on and definitely not enough warmth or comedy which is the hallmark of many Marvel films I've seen before.

I just wanted it to end but it kept dragging on for yet another battle... When it finally did end I felt cheated of the time.",4
Great movie!!!,14 August 2018,"I really lived Civil War, this was equal or better. The humor was back to were it should have gone, unlike Thor Ragnarok. Guardians Of The Galaxy actors were fun and great. Same for Iron Man. Great movie, thanks Hollywood!!!",8
Review,15 January 2023,"A deleated character 'Robin silos' (the cold bumb hellchild with no real extra capacity) was intended to be played by shane colby. Colby had grown up in the 1950's. Left in an abandoned house as an infint, and not allowed at the Grand Canyon anymore, Colby teaches himself how to be a wizerd at 14 years of age by a river everyday. %. And that's why he was going to play the role that eneded up going to Dr. Strange. He pretty much hated Costco though, and thats why his character (again, 'the cold bumb hellchild') was not used in Infinity War. Just so happends a costco was used as Thanos home base in the film. The whole avengers team drives up to costco in a van and Colby starts to shake. He says to director bill strip: ""i cant go into a costco because ill start feeling silenced and used like an 1800s women. They all had to head back to the studio (taylor swift included). She also got cut, as she insisted on singing a song in the film 3 times about a couple people who tryed to pick up a dime on the floor at the same time and nevere saw one another again for 88 lifespans. At any rate the finalized acting staff confronted thanos the next morning at costco. Thanos nonchalantly asking ""where's Colby today?"" to iron man (no one knowing that Colby was the uncle and boyfriend of Thanos). ""He's out of the film!"" Said ironman.",10
"Top Notch Action, Brilliant Climax!!!",29 December 2022,"Now this is what we are talking about! Mind boggling action sequences and a story line with a nerve wracking ending.

Brilliantly executed! I wanted to watch this in 2 sittings but just couldn't hold on, watched in one go.

One of the greatest villains of all time list got a new entry - Thanos. Viscious fellow.

So many super heroes all in one sitting, such a treat.

2 billion grosser worldwide and no wonder at that. This movie deserved all the accolades it got and more.

Watch it at the largest screen available to you with family and friends and you won't be disappointed.

Highly recommended!!!",9
Great movie,2 August 2020,That fact is that most of the bad ratings here are fake a..... Marvel fans and people who just watch movies in general not comic book or block buster films point this movie hypes you up and also breaks your heart at the sane time but it's to tell the porformance Thanos put and the actioned packed it was but overall a great one of marvel studios of not yet one of marvels greatest films of all time to be honest.,9

Are Marvel trying to make us HATE Tony Stark/Iron Man?,27 April 2018,,7
Ten years of storytelling culminates in one of the most satisfying conclusions in recent memory.,10 June 2018,"First off, I want to state that I am a massive fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. I have watched and loved every movie in the franchise, with the exceptions of Thor: The Dark World and The Incredible Hulk. I still liked them, but I didn't love them as much as the others.

Now, I will admit that I had my doubts heading into this movie. An event of this magnitude has never been attempted before this and I was worried that The Russo Brothers might not have been able to juggle the amount of characters and storylines that had been established up to this point. In the first ten minutes, those worries were put to rest. This movie is an incredible experience and you owe it to yourself to feel the same way every other person who has seen this movie has felt. You'll find yourself laughing, crying, throwing your fist into the air in excitement and then speechless by the end.

Josh Brolin gives an incredible performance as Thanos. Somehow, someway, despite him threatening to wipe out half of all life in the universe, you find yourself feeling for him as he has to make sacrifices that he knows have to be made for the greater good.

Every character we have come to know and love gets their time in the spotlight, even if it's just for a moment. The action in the movie is incredible and despite what some may say, every single joke lands. It doesn't slow down for a moment and by the end you'll be wishing for more.

Even a month after seeing the film, I have still yet to completely gather my thoughts. What I want to say is that this movie is a worthy culmination of ten years of hard work from Marvel. It is an experience that may never be replicated and I feel proud to have called myself a Marvel fan for many years.",10
DC v Marvel,30 April 2018,"I prefer DC because I grew up reading Batman, Superman, Justice League so I have a hard time understanding why they were not as popular as Marvel. I just come to realize why. Marvel is made for kids, younger adults, and then you have kids that have to taken to the movie by adults. Lots of money there. DC is darker and made for basically adults. Avengers: Infinity War is a good movie, but to me it is too much like a cartoon with too much CGI and too many superheros. One thing I don't understand, with the possibility of half of the people in the universe are going to die they tried to be too funny. In the end I viewed it once but have zero desire to see it again, but see it once for sure.",6
Won't watch avengers part 4,27 April 2018,,2
#FeigeWinsAgain,28 April 2018,Wow wow wow. Yes. I didn't think they would meet my expectations but they did. I just came from seeing it in theaters an hour ago but I'm definitely gonna re-watch this entire week. Marvel has knocked it out of the park with not only a legendary film that honestly lives up to its legend but also as the best Avengers film yet.,10
Action-packed popcorn fun,11 August 2018,"Almost everything just seems to work with the third Avengers installment, and it's a big improvement compared to Age of Ultron.

The various characters play their roles nicely throughout the movie, with ample screentime for almost all of them. A nice accomplishment, considering how many different characters are actually making an appearance.

The pacing felt exactly right to me and even though the movie speeds along rather quickly and there really isn't any character development to speak of beyond what we already know from previous movies, it never felt rushed. We are not working towards something anymore, we are nearing the end.

The action scenes are done very well, emphasizing each character's powers and abilities nicely and quite in detail, with plenty of originality in showing it to us. And the CGI? They outdid themselves; top notch and then some. No messy ""big CGI explosion showoff"" lazyness here.

With Thanos as a villain, we (finally) have a real villain. Well acted and far from one-dimensional.

I'm glad this time around there wasn't an overabundance of unfunny jokes being crammed into every possible scene. Still, not all the jokes/humor landed for me, which continues to turn certain characters into caricatures of themselves.

All in all, not flawless, but nitpicking at this point would be nitpicking for the sake of nitpicking. For what it's supposed to be, this movie did almost everything right. And most importantly: it was an entertaining ride from start to finish. 9/10",9
AVENGERS IS THE MUST SEE MOVIE OF THIS YEAR!,29 April 2018,,10
Avengers: Infinity War. BEST MOVIE OF THE DECADE,2 May 2018,"Avengers: Infinity War is the BEST Marvel movie of all time. ( My opinion, don't hate me ) The cgi was remarkable , the screen writing was INPECKABLE , the acting was amazing and the list goes on. But tbh I SPOILER WARNING I Thanos at some points doesn't seem like a bad guy , sure he wants to kill half the universe and succeeded. But he wanted to kill the bad half ( Don't ask me why Tom Holland, Chris Pat and Chadwick Boseman were killed) But he wanted to live in peace. But if you saw in the end credits that Nick Fury sends a message to Captain Marvel (Also getting her a stand alone film) meaning that Captain Marvel might be the super weapon. And if you read this far than I got treat for you. I looked online for Avengers 4 and saw the cast and I can tell you that The Black Panther will come back. Don't believe me? Link to full cast list. https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4154796/fullcredits Trust Me Tom Holland will return. Marvel can't kill Spiderman. But who knows",9
Infinity War,22 July 2020,"In fact, the main character isn't any one of our superheroes at all, but Thanos. But the movie isn't told from Thanos' point of view. Instead, Infinity War does an excellent job of explaining why thisbad guy wants to have all of the Infinity Stones. Make no mistake, he's still the enemy. However, Infinity War does such a good job that at a few parts you nod alongand say to yourself, ""OK Thanos, now I know why you want to do this."" The biggest surprise about Infinity War is how well the movie flows together. At no point is the film at all confusing. Weunderstand who is fighting whom, and what the risks and rewards are for each fight. It's not overcrowded, like one might believe, even with so many heroes involved. Science fiction author Douglas Adams's once wrote, ""Space is big. You just won't believe how vastly, hugely ... big itis. I mean, you may think it's a long way down the road to the chemist's , but that's just peanuts to space."" Replace the word""space"" with""Avengers: Infinity War"", and you have a reasonable idea of the scope of this movie -in terms of cast, complexity, and box office revenue. Indeed, it's both big and ambitious.",8
Incredible ensemble,5 August 2020,"This film is far better than the previous two Avengers films. It balances all its characters and settings with a deft hand. This time, the central thread is the villain Thanos who is portrayed by Josh Brolin. He is a brooding figure with a false sense of wisdom and he is the true star of this film. Everything else is amazing - the story, the action, the effects, the stakes. Before this, I was not very familiar with the Marvel Cinematic Universe so I didn't recognise half the characters and scenarios, but this film just pulls you along for the ride so you don't necessarily have to know everything beforehand.",8
What A Legend!,29 April 2018,"Alright, I'll put it straight, this is dope, the movie that I expect! Totally breaks the role of hero's journey. Actions are endless and shifting. Intense through the whole 2 and a half hours. Heartbreaking by such a tragedy in terms of some deaths are even unpredictable. The cliffhanger in the end really proves everything just gets started, and brings us curiosity and confusion. Love the way it focuses on Thanos's story line and how he kicks main characters' asses. It is still funny though, tons of hilarious dialogue and chilling among those characters still make me laugh a lot. Not gonna lie, however, this superhero movie really makes me feel the end of the world. Gun's a'blazin! Can't wait to see the next Avengers movie next year! Good job Marvel, and happy 10th birthday!",

EPIC Beyond Words - Someone identify the Rickenbacker At Avengers HQ Please,29 April 2018,"I fear that the theater box office might be slow as people who haven't seen the preceding films have to catch up before the film, or people who have only seen some of the films have to go watch the rest before returning for a second viewing.

Minimally one should have seen Ironman 2, all three Thor films, the GotG films, all Captaiin America films, and all the Avengers films along with Doctor Strange and Black Panther. If you these or read the comics it is a film that would be very difficult to follow ( you won't know the collector or why the Reality stone aka the Ether is there, etc.)

That said, if you've been all in since 2008 you're golden. And if you haven't read the comic arcs from which much of this is taken (five different books I think), you might be in for a shock. For me, all the speculation especially as it related to the comics and the actors contracts ends up being blown apart and I was relieved and shocked at the same time.

PS: The Real Question: In the scene at HQ when they discuss Vision and what to do, in the back on a stand next to Black Widow, is a Rickenbacker. Is it a 620 Fireglo DV247 and is it in homage to Tom Petty? It's not the Pete Townshend 360 and its not a bass. Someone find out which Rick is in the stand in the scene. Oh, and what happens to the Cloak of Levitation - does it 'make it'",10
Great!,29 April 2018,"10 years in the making and the Russo's knocked it out of the ballpark. I went it hoping all the heroes would get ample screen time without the movie feeling rushed or plot holes or things being unanswered and was not disappointed. The movie is balanced with bits of humor but also very serious. They really did a good job with Thanos' character, he is the perfect villain. Just a all around action packed, adrenaline ride!",10

so here it is...,25 April 2018,"Avengers: Infinity War (2018, Anthony Russo, Joe Russo)

This is a hard film to judge on its own merits with it being the conclusion of an 18 movie story arc. All the previous films good or bad had a solid story of their own with a traditional story telling format that sprinkled the connectivity and over reaching arc in towards the goal of The Avengers and the Guardians of the Galaxy facing Thanos. So this is the the film that concludes these sprinkles that were set in motion 10 years ago and is 100% not a film that can be watched by someone who has not seen all or at least most of the prior films. The MCU is basically a vert expensive tv show that way and also it mimics large cross over event comics which in my experience, the individual build up issues are better than the grand finale that brings everyone together and leaves little time for characters to shine as they are overstuffed. I think this is that overstuffed 'finale' but that is not to say that there is not plenty of other good and bad factors in this epic.

The Russo brothers started with Captain America: Winter Soldier (2014) which showed their shortcomings in the action sequences (in particular hand to hand combat), from their they moved to Captain America: Civil War (2016) which had a better story with a more emotional finale and better but still imperfect editing and filming of combat sequences but was saved in this vein with a great action set piece in the middle (the airport scene) and a strong final and more personal battle. Two years on they have now brought us this, the third Avengers film which its action/combat scenes are 'mostly' quite bad... I really can't tell what's really happening in a lot of them.

However despite being overstuffed and poorly made in some ways it is well paced with a great tone. It is not overly silly and jokey like some of the more recent Disney tentpoles (Thor: Ragnarok, The Last Jedi), instead it is more appropriately toned for the circumstances the characters find themselves with plenty of more natural humour between the more sombre moments. Another big plus is Josh Brolin as Thanos and the way the character is written. He is the only really fleshed out character in the film and he is a really great three dimensional foil who does not disappoint after such a huge build up. Another positive thing that surprised me was how the film was pretty much half Avengers and half Guardians of the Galaxy.

I think James Gunn would have been a better choice as director for this film but it could have been a lot worse. In the end we have a massive film with almost every character from past films in the series that despite its technical flaws has a great last few minutes that would serve as an even more amazing exclamation mark/ full stop if we all did not realise that due to the way the economics of a successful franchise works that much of it will be undone somehow in the future.",
Enjoyable movie.. but,7 August 2018,"In my opinion it's incredibly overhyped and overrated. It's just another one of those flashy 21st century marvel movies, but longer and with more emotional moments I guess. And more characters, which makes it quite messy to me. Maybe I'm just not a big fan of this genre.",6
Though A Heartbreaking ending The film was still Amazing!,26 July 2018,"Infinity war was something that The MCU has been building up to for 10 years now!! Trust me when I say it wasn't a let down, This third installment in the Avengers Series Is absolutely incredible, Now like every movie it wasn't a flawless film, with 1 or 2 dragged scenes, and Some huge Plot holes! But besides all that The film was Amazing and cant wait till it hits Blu Ray so I can watch it over and over!!!",8
Disappointing but not terrible,28 September 2021,"Avengers: Infinity War is not a terrible movie. Let me make this very clear. It is shot well, it has some very interesting set pieces and plot direction and it continues the Avengers storyline in a fairly compelling way. So why is it disappointing? Why am I dropping a 6/10 on this thing? Overload.

Avengers: Infinity War simply has too much going on. There is a persistent element of urgency to everything happening in the film but there are so many characters, plot pieces to connect, settings and motivations that it just gets to be a mess. You're never really given enough time to make emotional connections to any of the characters in the film (except a few but this is spoiler free) so the plot feels superficial even though the stakes are supposedly very high.

If you haven't kept up on all of the Marvel movies prior to watching Avengers: Infinity War you're going to end up sitting through a film constantly wondering why various characters aren't given any characterization whatsoever. There really is very little growth or development of any character in this film despite major events happening to quite a few of them. If this sounds paradoxical its because it is. You've got characters experiencing personal quests/journeys separate from everyone else, for which the outcomes are generally predictable. You've got major plot elements that are also predictable but designed to pull the emotional strings even though they're thrown at you rapid-fire.

It isn't a terrible movie. But it certainly isn't a great movie. Avengers: Infinity War is a solid 6/10. I enjoyed watching it but only really because, like many, I am very invested in the Marvel stories at this point and I want to see how it ends. I've seen it twice and I likely won't go out of my way to see it a third time.",6
Highly Overrated..!!,2 May 2018,"I mean I don't get it why this movie came in the top 250 movies in IMDb. I am not saying that this is a bad movie but the best super hero movie ever? People have just have just made up their minds that it's avengers so it must be a very good movie. The pervious avengers movie were better than this one. In this movie everything was scattered, the good thing was that they connected everything with the previous marvel movies that is why I gave it a 5 rating or else I wouldn't have given it that also. The end especially, people are left clueless as to what is about to happen. Only that person will know who has actually read the comics. I was shocked to see that this movie is above Fight Club!! I mean what on earth are people thinking? This is just my view on it though but I don't think this was a good movie, there was just a lot of hype created for this movie because which people actually started believing that this is the greatest movie ever made while in reality it was just an average movie.",5
The Best of the MCU,11 December 2022,"I've always been a big fan of Marvel movies, and it pains me to see how far the movies have fallen in the most recent films of Phase 4.

However, that brings me back to when the MCU was at its peak, which was here, in the Infinity Saga. After watching hours upon hours of movies leading up to this, all of your favorite superheroes are here, in one spectacular movie.

It's not different from other Marvel films - it still has the superhero action and the sly jokes - but for me, it didn't really need to be. However, it's refreshing in its own way, because it centers on Thanos. All of the MCU movies have not been leading up to one superhero; instead, they culminate in this movie about a supervillain. He is a finely crafted main character, and all you can do is root against him.

It's hard to imagine that anyone is watching this movie for the first time, because of just how (deservingly) hyped up it is. However, if you are, take it from a Marvel fan like me that this is the best of the MCU.",10
Best MCU film to date,29 November 2018,"The Russo brothers are just fantastic at directing these types of films. And for one I love this ending, this ending is better than any other MCU film. One of my top 5 favorite MCU film up to date. Loved it and I just can't wait for Avengers 4. 10/10",10

"Yeah, every bit as good as critics say and more.",30 April 2018,"Because my index for great epic adventure is dictated by Homer's Iliad and Odyssey, the Marvel heroic tales like Avengers: Infinity War supply my modern need to experience excellence but fall short of Homer's weighty themes and complex characters. However, with super-human visuals, contemporary heroic films do a credible job of taking the place of my imagination.

Not that that substitution is preferable to Homer's working my mind to create Cyclops and Sirens and assorted baddies as well as the original modern smart hero, Odysseus.

The Avengers and their buddies must come together to fight the mighty Thanos (Josh Brolin), whose goal as he decimates half the universe's population is to possess all six infinity stones. Because Vision (Paul Bettany) has the last one, you have an idea what the ending choreography will look like.

Yes, there will be the usual explosions and guns, which still strike me as incredulously outdated even though super-hero films abound with the munitions. I see in Infinity fewer explosions and fistfights than I have previously witnessed, a source of my abiding criticism of this genre. The Russo brothers directors have judiciously larded the film with these tropes while leaving plenty of room for wisecracks, a joy for me.

Nobody does them better than Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.), with his better-than-thou intelligence and impeccably caustic wit: ""I swore off dairy, then Ben and Jerry's named a flavor after me.""Peter Quill/Star Lord (Chris Pratt) has some good ones as well: ""Let's talk about this plan of yours. I think it's good, except it sucks. So let me do the plan, and that way, it might be really good."" I like the witty repartee much more than the explosions.

With as many major warriors as could be possible on one screen, Infinity rarely develops character as we should expect in any drama, Greek or otherwise. Yet, the writers and directors can then guarantee the action to be constant and no one fall asleep, except those hard-core comic-book fans that wait for the scene after the end credits.

The final conflict guarantees a financially-rich opening for part two, which will have to move some to match the record-breaking first weekend take for Infinity. Homer would be happy enough with the new epics but much happier that his adventurers are guaranteed infinity or at least immortality.",

Rewatching after five years,3 February 2023,,9
Overkill Kill Kill,28 April 2018,"At some point the question of what do these super-heroes do if there are no threats comes-up? One thinks they are just ordinary people going about ordinary lives. Is that what you should do with these powers? Then, the threat of threats come and they all join-up to take it on. I get it. However, what do we do next time? How many times can you save the world? With all these other life-forms, different worlds/planets etc. and different types of super-heroes and their powers why all the fighting all the time? Leaving that alone for now, I remember the days of Superman, Batman, Spider-Man, Green Lantern and the like who stopped burglars, armed robbers, rescued people and kept law and order. Boy things have changed and I am okay with all that too. However, how many dooms-day scenarios can we come with here? Take Thanos for instance. Okay, he's bad. He likes to kill and he goes after planet after planet. Why? Well in this case it is to find what he wants. Okay. What then? What if he gets it all? Now what? He can kill better, faster & cheaper? It doesn't compute. One other annoying thing that comes up in the dialog is the expression OMG or oh my God. If super-heroes are uttering this then there must be a God and if so HE is all powerful exceeding the whole movie premise. That phrase called me back to reality and these movies could do with out it because it doesn't work well in make-believe worlds. All this aside, the theaters were packed, people were rushing in, everyone had their snacks, drinks and pleasant company and apparently we the public like this stuff. It all works rather well if one considers it is all only in the Marvel Universe and the viewers must leave their real Universe behind to visit there. Same with the DC world too. Some of the stories are really far-out stretching it to the max. What do you get a billionaire for Xmas comes to mind? They got it all. Same with us viewers. What's next? Beware of....",7

They are stories involving a well-cast group of superheroes from the Marvel comic books. The first Avengers was a lot of fun, but disappointing because there were only a handful of the comic book characters fighting. Age of Ultron sucked and it was boring but this one, well, I admit that Guardians of the Galaxy got me excited for it, but it's great to see a bigger cast of superheroes.

Thanos, in pure Voldemort scheme, is out looking for the Infinity Stones to give him the ultimate power, and the heroes must stop him before he finds them all. That is pretty much the movie. However, everyone has a story, including Thanos this time, and I realized halfway through the film, that he is a good villain. It took several movies but they finally have a good supervillain to face! YES!

What makes this film great is that it has a perfect mix of action, comedy, and even backstory. The movie even takes time out to flesh out characters, and it does it in a way where it isn't boring. There is always something to look at, there are a ton of characters to cover, and the movie actually handles them quite well. I honestly don't have too much to gripe other than, if this is your first time seeing one of these Marvel movies, you might get lost.

What a way to kick off the summer! I was excited for this and even had goosebumps with the trailer, but this film definitely delivered. It saddens me because I really hope DC gets this kind of following. As it stands, Marvel is dominating and Disney is banking. The steam isn't running out yet with this franchise.",9
Simply fantastic,25 April 2018,"I rarely write reviews, but then I've rarely had such an extraordinary time at the cinema. 'Avengers: Infinity Wars' met and even ascended my expectations, and managed to balance a huge cast (my only doubt before the film) fantastically. My friend and I both left the film speechless, yet filled with so many theories and thoughts.

This truly is the first part of two, and it builds an unbelievably great foundation for the next film. Yet it somehow manages to tell it's own story without you feeling like this is a film cut off at the middle. You don't get a neatly wrapped ending, but I actually just don't care because the ending you do get is one of proper shock.

That being said, I am a full-on Marvel-fan and as such I do know the characters backstories and the references to previous films being thrown around. I am more emotionally invested than someone not as familiar with the MCU franchise, and I don't know how well the film works for a person like that. I do believe that to fully enjoy it, you have to take your time and at least familiarise yourself with at least some of the backstory.

But in the end, the target group is the fans, and this film surely delivers for us. I'd say it's on par, if not exceeding, with 'The Avengers'. It's sure gonna be a long wait for part two...",10

You need to have watched half of the marvel movies to appreciate this movie.,19 August 2018,"Infinite war is not a bad movie at all, but I feel like people are overrating this movie way to much telling how amazing the acting, story, and scenes were. Maybe it's because I haven't watched all of the previews movie, but to me this was just something to waste some time with, it had some good moments but overall I wouldn't say it deserves to be so high on list.",7
Please stop the Hype!,29 April 2018,"Suffering hype fatigue, over a year of industry talk about this movie in pre release. It takes away from viewing the movie. In the end it's just more of the same computer generated over the top smash and bash that appeals to 12 year olds or those that are stuck at that age. The first avengers was original. But now what Hollywood movie makers due best, take an original movie concept to cash in until death in franchising occurs. Sorry about raining on your Hollywood comic book Heroes block borer. But the only hero I can see is someone to say enough comic book sequels. They've become boring and predictable recycles. I spent more time thinking about how uncomfortable the theater seat was than being interested in the things blowing up in the movie. Seems Hollywood is addicted to CGI for making movies that shouldn't be made. If they keep going this way they could probably try selling a film of things just blowing up, no story, plot or actors acting just things blowing up.",2
Everything I wanted it to be.,1 May 2018,"As a grown man I am not ashamed to say that I think I had tears in my eyes more than not. Whether it was from sadness or pure joy. To not give any spoilers I will say that there is an entrance that Thor makes that for some reason made me cry and laugh at how amazing it felt to see. It was truly awe inspiring. When Thanos first appears on screen my heart skipped a beat as I realized that it is finally here. Though two guys behind me wouldn't shut up and I had to tell them to do so during the credits when they were the only ones talking. I at one point heard one of them crying while saying through the sobs ""I love this movie so much."" This movie experience made me feel connected, even to a person I would normally not care for, due to the commentary he and his friend provided before and after the movie, and the random laughs and comments throughout which were more than audible. I felt shear panic, sadness, and joy all at once the entire movie. I am a big movie lover, I comb IMDb constantly for trailers, trivia, and any news I can find. When everyone else opens Facebook, or Twitter every morning in the bathroom, I open IMDb. I am obsessed with movies and the experience of seeing one in theatres for the first time. I can truly say that this was the best movie experience of my life. It wasn't until a couple of days later that I realized that Avangers 4 HAS to top it. I cannot imagine. Any true Marvel fan or movie lover should love this movie!!!",10

Garbage Movie for Garbage People,27 April 2018,All I have to say is this: the Russo Brothers are not good film makers and I probably won't be seeing one of their films ever again.,6
Infinity War needs to be seen to be believed!,30 April 2018,"Avengers: Infinity War is finally here after much anticipation and it features an ensemble cast of nearly every single hero from the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It tells the story of how all of the heroes from the MCU must team up with the currently broken Avengers to take down Thanos, who has been searching for the Infinity Stones so he can use them for his own selfish purposes.

The events for this movie have been building up since The Avengers' post credits scene. We've gotten a few glimpses of Thanos and his plot, but we haven't had a good idea on his plans. That all comes together here, where we see almost all of the heroes split into small teams before coming together and forming one large one. There is a lot of fun, yet tense action here; the opening, for instance helps set the tone, showing that this is going to be a much darker film compared to most Marvel movies. There are some high stakes that are fought for that could end up shaking the status quo permanently.

Josh Brolin does a fantastic job as Thanos. Thanos gives off a very, very serious and dark vibe, which shows that he is not somebody that should be messed with. I feel as though Brolin did a perfect job doing so and is one of the best performances of the film, and that's saying something. You can tell that he had fun with his role, don't just take his word for it when he says that he had fun with it.

The humor's also there and thankfully isn't too jam packed into the film. Since this is a film that fits in an onslaught of characters in a 2 and a half hour runtime, it doesn't try to fit in too much humor. I find it to be a good thing considering that it mostly tries, and succeeds in trying to be very bleak. My main issue with the movie, however, is that there is often too much going on at the same time. In the first act, (Which is pretty long since there are many characters to establish) the movie tries to juggle around 4 or 5 different plots at once. That's where the film can get disorganized and hard to process.

It's hard not to spoil this film, but Avengers Infinity War is a fantastic addition to the MCU and definitely worth the hype that it's been given.

9/10",9
Predictable and overloaded,27 April 2018,"I knew almost all about this movie before I saw it: Superheroes disagree amongst themselves, but must stand together against some CGI villain, This CGI villain is off to destroy a city.... no wait, we've already done that, the World..... no wait, we've done that too, THE UNIVERSE, and the superheroes more less prevail in the end, leaving some sort of cliffhanger though to ensure further profits from the next instalment.

Please... a little more orginality next time, Marvel?",6
"OMG, but not in a good way",1 May 2018,"I'm not a great fan of Marvel, but I went to see this movie thinking it would be a bit of a romp. You know, something light-hearted and fun, with some great action sequences worthy of a big screen. Where the heroes win in the end.

The action sequences were epic. The plot had holes that were just as big.

Sure, some of those might be resolved in the next movie, and the heroes will probably win in the end, but the ending was an anti-climax, made worse because of the needlessly sappy and drawn out failures of all the different Avengers.

At the end of the movie, no one left the cinema. The audience sat there stunned, waiting for some glimmer of hope. It never came. There was defeat. There was death. There wasn't the satisfying victory to help ease the long set up and the forced attempts at humor. Even the post-credit teaser was depressing.

I won't write this movie off completely given there's more to come, but disappointing to have to wait until the next movie for some catharsis.",3
Something else!,30 April 2018,"The plot, the characters, the acting, the effects, everything was on point! Go see it!",10
Bold and beautiful,21 August 2018,"Comedy, sadness, strength, vulnerability - this film has all and more. It could have been twice as long but still kept the viewer in its grasp. I hope tempus fugit as we await the next installment!",10
Best Marvel movie yet? Probably,4 May 2018,"They really hit this one out of the park. I had some concerns, the trailers made it look like a typical save-the-world storyline, and Avengers 2 was terrible. But man I was completely wrong, this was great and mostly thanks to the villain Thanos, who is one of the better movie antagonists in recent memory and probably the best MCU villain (except perhaps Killmonger). He is cunning, ruthless, and physically very powerful.

Marvel villains are usually foils to the heroes, and only exist for the hero to defeat them and learn more about himself in the process. Here, Thanos is a fully fleshed out character who experiences a range of emotions and spends a large part of the movie on his own personal odyssey. He shares surprisingly little screentime with the Avengers (he sends his minions instead) and there is little gloating, cackling or lame quips. When they do clash, they are mere obstacles to be swatted away rather than his genuine rivals.

Taking the action away from Earth and into the cosmos allowed for very imaginative and psychedelic battles. There is a battle on an alien planet that could be ripped straight from the comic books.

I had some problems with the ending and the usual Marvel humour got a little tiresome at times, but other than that this was as close to a perfect comic book movie as you will likely get.",9

"An epic failure at script writing, kills a would be great film",2 May 2018,"Let me start by saying that no superhero movie is supposed to be realistic. We all know that. Still, script writers, and comic books writers too struggle, to make the story feel as if it was real, otherwise, none would relate to the story. In order to get this real feeling, the emotional base of the story is crucial, the character development must be first class, if these two work, we've got a film we can emphathize with, we might even forget the entire premise is unreal. But very often the writers don't trust their own ability. Sometimes they feel the whole story is so farfetched they have to go an extra mile to make it more real. That's when things start going wrong. That's where it went wrong for this movie. I never expected a real life drama, if that was what I wanted I wouldn't be watching this movie to begin with.

It's very hard to explain my point precisely without spoilers, and I don't do spoilers. So what can I say. I can say that by the movie's end we're left with two choices, both steming from a desire to make the story feel more real, maybe to surprise us more than we usually get surprised in movies we came to know so well. Any which way, the two options we're left with are either, the entire movie will be reversed in the next installment. Which means that the whole Infinity War was a teaser for the next MCU installment. Or the entire MCU is getting a reboot.

I hate both options. And it's a great shame, because otherwise we had a perfectly good installment in the MCU. With the great sense of humor we all know and love. With great acting performances (Josh Brolin is really superb, making Thanos one of the greatest villains we ever saw), wonderful cinematography and CGI and everything else we come to expect of the MCU. If everybody loves it so much, why do we need to reboot it, when it's still going so very well. Or else why would you waste an entire installment as a teaser for the next one. We already know all the installments are connected to each other, we all wait for the post credits scenes, no matter how long we have to sit in the dark. So why did we need this silly concoction. It didn't make it feel more real, it made me feel frustrated and even angry because whatever option will come into being in the future I'll still think this one was a waste of my time and everybody else's.",7

Heavy Indigestion,2 May 2018,"Sometimes when you cook a dish for your guests, you think that you'll make it more tasteful if you keep adding ingredients over ingredients; so, you have made this nice pizza, you have put your tomato sauce, your mozzarella cheese, maybe some ham, then you think why not some mushrooms, and well peppers will be just perfect on top it, and don't forget olives and cappers, hey we have some sausage in the fridge just slam it on top of it....etc. Most likely your guests will spend the night wrestling with your heavy-loaded pizza, trying to digest it. Well, that is how I feel after watching Avengers - Infinity War; it's not by cramming piles of different super-heroes into one single movie that you make a great movie. It just results in a huge loss of focus and in the inability to pull together a cohesive story as you have to make space for this crowd of stars. Note that I'm not even complaining about the ordeal of CGI: they have by now become a commodity in contemporary movies and not even only sci-fi, so their abuse in this case was in the expectations. But geeez, the plot....the plot is so thin that one might claim there is not one; just an infinite series of punches, hand-fights, bang-bang, etc... So I'll go now, I have some work to do tonight to try and digest this nuclear pizza....",2

A tasting menu,21 August 2018,"I do enjoy the Marvel films, I have loved every Avengers film and make no mistake this has the lot, most characters are here and maintain the comedy and pace. This is an amazing film and I am now on my second viewing and will continue to watch. It's almost like a tasting menu at a top restaurant, each section and every course whets the appetite for the next course, every course compliments the other and adds to the anticipation. The truth is that by the end of the film, it's almost as though I'm full to exhaustion. Don't get me wrong, I think this is an extroidinary film and a breathtaking feat, I just wonder what course comes next.",9
Incredible movie,29 April 2018,This is the most important movie in world it is incredible and amazing movie,10
Entertaining,1 May 2018,"Brilliant piece of direction. Each of the characters have been given proper attention and space in the movie. Thanos was brilliant. Probably the best part of the movie. Hulk was disappointing, almost reduced to a joker. Don't understand why. All other actors in the movie have done their part well. Hope Iron Man has more screen time in the next part.",9
Do believe the hype. This film will leave searching for more answers or clues.,25 April 2018,"I have never felt so emotionally exhausted after watching a Marvel movie, but Avengers: Infinity War had me experiencing all sorts of emotions. Sadness, hope, despair.

The Russo brothers have pulled it off,7 May 2018,After watching countless super hero movies and older avengers tv series's I was worried that the movie won't have any surprises left to give us. The writers did an amazing job giving us new material and a tremendous job bringing such a large and diverse set of superheroes together in an organic way that works well. Kudos to the whole Avengers team !,10
Let's make some things clear,17 May 2018,,6
Amazing! Amazing! AMAZING!,25 April 2018,"Was such a great film! Thanos was portrayed phenomanly by Josh Brolin. All the characters had ample screen time, which I thought would be a problem for the film having so many characters. I had my mouth wide open for the majority of this film. Will definitely see it again in cinemas.",10

One of Marvel's Best Adventures!!!,24 May 2018,,10
A freaking 10!,7 May 2018,"I don't give very many movies a 10 ... actually none at all, besides this one. The reason is, there is not really a dull moment in the movie. I actually cheered and clapped at one point in the movie. You'll know when it happens ;). The action is there, the comedy is where it should be. They did a great job in balancing out all the marvel characters into this amazing movie. If you haven't seen it yet and are reading these reviews to see whether or not "" it's the movie for you."" Do you self a favor to all of us. Don't see it. You my friend are not worthy. :). Just watch it ! Thank you for everyone who participated in making this movie possible. They don't get the credit they deserve. Hats off to you. Be proud. When sitting through the credit remember the people's names across the screens cause they contributed to movie history. I thank you.",10
As overwhelming as it is ambitious,27 April 2018,"I'd like to preface this review by clearly stating that this movie has prerequisites to a certain degree. If you've seen every Marvel movie since The Avengers, you will know all of the characters and understand why they do what they do.

But, on the other hand, even if you don't even know the first thing about Marvel, it'll at least keep you entertained.

Avengers: Infinity War goes to incredible lengths to make you feel that you got your money's worth. The action is constant, the CGI beautiful, and casting nothing short of legendary. I think Marvel, and by extension Disney, set out to give the fans what they wanted from a high-budget action movie.

Because of this high-octane approach to entertainment, the story is very simple, straightforward, and borders on cliche. Trying to layer more elements on top of their final product would have required more character interaction scenes, which to me, would have been welcome.

On top of this, if you have a favorite Marvel movie character, you might leave the theater wondering if he/she was what you wanted to see. The movie does an admirable job at giving the characters equal screen time and making sure everyone plays an important part, but on the other hand, a couple of my favorite characters didn't feel quite right. I attribute this to the fact that Avengers: Infinity War had a tremendous number of moving parts, and I think they just had to take certain liberties that were bound to make some fans shake their heads.

For my last point, Avengers: Infinity War took risks. It took big risks. In a certain sense, this stays true to Marvel comics, which do the same. After a long line of Marvel movies that have generally exercised caution and given the fans a simple good against evil story, Infinity War goes beyond and feels as if it's bringing the series back to its comic roots. Because of this, I'm adding one star onto my initial rating of 8/10.",9
I'm Left Speechless (in the Good Way),28 April 2018,"Avengers: Infinity War might just be the most insane movie I've ever seen. I'm literally left speechless coming out of this movie. The Russo Brothers have once again made a great Marvel film, this time on the biggest scale in MCU history. Basically every Avenger you've seen on screen is in this movie and it's pretty awesome.

There's a lot to love here. First, it was such a joy to see all the Avengers on screen together again. The comradery between all of them is great and the interaction between characters who meet for the first time is both hilarious and powerful. Second, Thanos is officially the best villain in the MCU. Killmonger was great but Thanos takes it to a while another level. This is by far the darkest Marvel movie and Thanos is the driving force behind it. Josh Brolin gives an amazing performance as Thanos, who is much more layered than I thought. Thanos made the stakes feel real, which is often a knock on the MCU, and he made the heroes feel a sense of real desperation that honestly seemed to lack in the other Avengers movies. The movie took great risks story-wise that will leave everyone thinking hard for a long, long time. What makes Infinity War stand out is the bold new directions it goes in, and it completely pays off. The way the movie wraps up will undoubtedly cause so much craze. I'm still flustered by what I saw. Even though the movie is so dark, the humor is great (again). As always, the action scenes and music are amazing.

However, no movie is perfect. There are so many characters in Infinity War and it easily succumbs to this throughout. The Russo's handled it as well as they could have I think, but the pacing and tone are really uneven at times, especially in the first hour. The movie jumps to so many different places and tones, and it felt way too fast. Also, some of the character decisions did not make sense and left me confused.

Overall, Avengers: Infinity War is another great addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The villain Thanos is the best and his impact on the heroes is ridiculously amazing. I really have no idea where Marvel goes from here going forward in all honesty, and that's a testament to how bold this movie is in its endeavors.

Avengers: Infinity War gets an A.",9
Stones R Us,25 April 2018,"The Intergalactic Dance Off begins! A spoiler free review will grant us the favor of the great hero Kevin Bacon from Footloose.

Thanos, The Mad Titan, wants to take care of business and collect the Infinity Stones on his cool golden glove. With these stones he will be able to decimate the Galaxy and bring forth a 'galactic reset' with a lot less people in it. Up to our Mightiest Heroes and friends to team up and stop him but do they succeed? This Part 1 of the conclusion picks up where the post-credit scène of Thor: Ragnarok(2017) left us. Thanos makes first contact and makes sure we know why he's the ultimate villain. As of this point we get the usual mix of action; humor and pretty scenery that are the trademark of a Marvel Universe-movie. Why should you see this? It's a thrill ride to see the conclusion of a decade worth of movies, your favorite neighborhood heroes and the best Marvel villain yet. Thanos' motives are explored so he's not just the 'superevil dude' but gets a 'likeable' background.

Why should you skip this? 2,5 hours without break is a brutal evening. I'm afraid a rewatch would lead to boring bits so they should have cut some stuff out. If you have not seen the other films, make sure you do so that you get all the characters and easter eggs. You could be growing tired of the Marvel Universe, one of us had this feeling with Black Panther(2018).

One of the best films I've ever seen,27 April 2018,It puts all of marvels other films to shame. This is truly incredible. I had my reserves because there was going to be so many people in it but it works. I need to see it again in the cinema.,10
"Buena, pero no excelente",16 September 2018,"Marvel / Disney nunca hará una película que pueda considerarse una obra maestra, esta fue la oportunidad, The Avengers también lo fue, y hay un par más que son claramente excepcionales (The Winter Soldier y Guardians of the Galaxy), pero a este ritmo, nunca lo harán. En este momento están en una zona de confort que aparentemente no planean dejar, con películas ni maravillosas ni pobres, sino un punto medio de Blockbusters que se ciernen entre lo bueno y lo entretenido, y lo predecible y lo poco original. Infinity War es solo eso, tiene momentos muy altos de brillantez absoluta, pero también otros llenos de mediocridad y creados exclusivamente para satisfacer a un público impresionable y conformista. Los momentos en que sacan a relucir las ventajas de pertenecer al mismo universo se desintegran cuanto más lo piensas, cuando te das cuenta de que habrá 5, 10, 15 películas más en el futuro que modificarán o ignorarán los eventos que sucedieron en el pasado. Películas, que no respetan las obras ni el público que las veneran y, por lo tanto, reducen el impacto de escenas supuestamente emotivas o que es muy probable que tengan mucho menos peso en el futuro. Básicamente, todos lo sabemos, pero no es raro ignorar y dar mayor potencial a algo como Infinity War, que no es una basura total, pero ni siquiera es lo mejor que Marvel ha hecho en su universo, ni mucho menos lo que el género de superhéroes tiene que entregar. Siendo justo, una calificación de 6 o 7 es lo correcto, quizás menos, pero más, no puedo asignarlo a algo que está vacío.",6
400 million and worth it!,13 May 2018,"Yes, it is too long, yes it has too many characters all vying for attention and yes the story is convoluted by bad blood, family matters and missing elements. Yet it is still a must see and you will.",9
Disappointed but amused,23 August 2018,"I'm a huge marvel fan , but in this movie I didn't feel the tension although it's a important war , firstly the acting of some actors wasn't on point , secondly I feel like some important heroes weren't given enough screen time as others, also the script was smart but made the characters more neglecting to the gravity of the threat facing them and just joking around by increasing the humor and decreasing the seriousness, last but not least the movie seemed in a hurry from my personal view . In the end I can't say I didn't enjoy it , it one of the best MCU movies out there , it gave us a great antagonist not like all the others , good in every way not just the CGI that made him look complete and great but also the acting of the actor and the reflections of the character, and it gave us the opportunity to see our heroes united for the same cause .(this was my personal opinion of the movie and I am exited to see what the second part has to show us !)",6

The Hype is Real.,27 April 2018,"Wow. I don't usually do movie reviews but this has got to be one of the greatest movies I have ever seen in my entire life. I have never been through so many emotions in a short span of time. Everything about this movie is Phenomenal.The soundtrack, the visual effects, the acting, the menacing characteristics of Thanos, EVERYTHING. I entered the movie with high hopes, and was not disappointed. I laughed, I cried, and I was drawn in by the action scenes. This movie entailed everything that a good movie possesses. I will be seeing it again. Do not waste your time, and GO TO THIS MOVIE. I didn't know it was possible, but now I am even more in love with the MCU.",10
Wow just wow!!!,29 April 2018,Simply blown away and still processing what I just watched. So many mixed emotions and questions!?! Marvel has outdone themselves!,10
Justifies All the Hype and Keeps the Marvel Blockbuster Train Rolling,29 April 2018,"Marvel's been at this so long that their success is no longer a surprise. They aren't just a part of Disney film making, they're a benchmark in big budget entertainment. So, expectations for the new Avengers installment were sky high. We've had smash hit after smash hit from the studio and I'm happy to report that they've got another winner. One reason for this is that Infinity War maintains the delicate balance of keep things light while keeping the stakes raised. There were more than a few times that the entire audience burst out laughing but with the added threat of Thanos (Josh Brolin), the threat he poses to the world is grave and you feel that tension. This is compounded by the fact that this doesn't follow a template, they take things on new tangents and although I was able to guess a few things, Infinity War never fell into a rut or felt too familiar.

Much like the Russo's previous work for Marvel (CA: The Winter Soldier and CA: Civil War) they somehow give everyone enough time to show what they can do, even with such a large ensemble. I was able to spend enough time with each major character to find out their motivation and how they planned to deal with the looming threat. They also split into smaller groups and they had such great chemistry together that there wasn't a stale moment. Everyone is humanized, and no one is just defined by their special abilities. This even includes the villains which is no mean feat. We see new sides of some of the characters, background players get some time in the spotlight and although these heroes boast superhuman abilites, we learn just how vulnerable they are in their moments of weakness.

You don't get much bigger than the names in this cast. That sounds hyperbolic, but you have to remember just how many people have been collecting checks as heroes or villains in this universe. There are too many members in the cast to go through 1 by 1 but I did have a couple of favourites. Chris Hemsworth builds off his strong performance in Thor: Ragnarok, Robert Downey Jr. was his typically excellent self and it was nice that Elizabeth Olsen got more to do as Scarlet Witch. Some of the relatively new cast members like Tom Holland and Chadwick Boseman were also exceptional. I also really liked Josh Brolin as Thanos, he's a worthwhile villain for our heroes and there was a lot of feeling in his performance despite it being performance capture.

With a movie housing so many wild and memorable characters with their own independent style and motivations, there was bound to be a couple of missteps. The biggest for me was Gamora's subplot with Thanos. Don't get me wrong, there's a lot of important work here where we see another side to Thanos that isn't a bloodthirsty lunatic. It makes him a more memorable Marvel antagonist instead of him just fading into the crowd. But Gamora loses strength as a character by how easily she bends to Thanos and it dampened parts of the story for me. They also make Dr. Strange even more arrogant and there were moments where his act was wearing a little thin. The movie doesn't completely skate around plot holes but none of them are egregious enough to wreck the movie. The other small issue is that there is so much buildup and hype for Infinity War that it was almost impossible to live up to that ideal.

The last thing I want to mention is that I want to credit the creative team for doing something bold with the ending. It would have been easy to just setup a sequel and slide into a happy ending but that's not the direction they chose to go with. They really caught me off guard and I think most people will have a similar reaction. It makes me just that more intrigued about where they will choose to go next (we know there's going to be another Avengers movie, that's not a spoiler).

Anyone who's been attending the local cineplex in the summer over the past 5-10 years has a passing familiarity with Iron Man, Captain America and the Marvel characters. The fans expected a lot and this movie delivered. Almost every character had their time to shine, the movie balances the action and the humour superbly and they tell a story that does all the buildup justice. They also take it a way that will open things up and stray from predictably just marketing for the next standalone. Keep your eyes open for some Easter eggs and a couple of surprise appearances. If you're a Marvel fan, I'd recommend this wholeheartedly but let's face it, you were going to go see it anyway.",9
We're in the endgame now,4 May 2018,"Expect the unexpected. As someone who tends to think the marvel films could use a more serious tone with graver consequences, this film fit it out of the park. The film is more of a thanos story and plays out as such, where he is the hero of his own tale. His goals, while extreme, are justifiable in his own mind. This, among other things you just have to see in the theater, make him one of, if not the best, comic book villain to date. I payed full price for my seat but I only used the edge.",10
Best Marvel movie yet,1 May 2018,"I don't usually write reviews but after I saw this I knew I had to. This movie had a great combination of action, story, and it's fair amount of tears throughout.

Too much going on,29 April 2018,Maybe my failure to follow MCU movies from the beginning is the reason why but I felt that there were way too many stories happening in this movie (they almost felt random) and they didn't make sense / didn't work for me. My husband actually fell asleep early on in the movie.,7

What a waste of time,29 April 2018,,2
I challenge you not to enjoy this movie,30 April 2018,"Although I doubt this movie will win any non editing awards it is a genuinely enjoyable movie. A movie not afraid to break off from superhero movie cliches, Marvel's Avengers: Infinity War is a movie that has something for everyone. Anyone who didn't enjoy this movie didn't want to enjoy it. Infinity War is easily the best Marvel movie to date with one of the all time greatest movie villains.",10
As close to a 10 as I've seen,27 April 2018,"I knew from past Marvel movies and the trailers that this would be a good movie, but it exceeded my expectations in every way.

One big problem with the excellent MCU is their weak villains and the lack of consequences for the good guys.

This movie brought us excellent and very strong villains, as well as plenty of consequences for the good guys.

There was lots of well-placed humor. Unlike the new Star Wars movies which can't place a good joke to save their lives, the MCU really gets that aspect of these movies.

I was wondering how they could make this movie without considerable violence...not our usual fights, but true violence. They didn't pull any punches. This movie is the most violent of the MCU by far. They didn't sugar coat this movie for the kiddies.

Thanos is amazing. Not just a mindless bad guy, but someone with a fleshed out character and clear motivation. Whether you agree with his reasoning or not, you can still relate to him because our own history has seen similar ideas from the Communists and Nazis. ""Genocide for the greater good"" as monsters from our past have declared it.

If you are a fan of the MCU, this movie has everything you love from the previous films and everything you have wanted but haven't seen.

I give this a 10/10 after two viewings (now five two weeks later). I find very few flaws.

Edit: A couple weeks later and I have to laugh at all the recent 1/10 reviews. The DC fangirls are waging a unified rating war from their Mom's basement in an attempt to drag the rating down to that of movies like Justice League. All the while, Infinity War races to 2 BILLION dollars and is already #5 top grossing of all time. Keep hoping for a good movie, DC fans. Nothing will touch this, though. Over half of the people who have seen this rate it 10/10 while 1/10 is less than 2%.",10

Even better than the Dark Knight,13 June 2018,"Haters can try and bring this film down but this is a breathtaking movie which has been perfectly executed...and the fans know it. Thanos is the greatest villain in superhero movies. The action was truly epic. The film had heart, emotional involvement and well timed humour.

The greatest superhero film yet made. Seriously, how did they pull this off?",10
An epic masterpiece,6 August 2018,I'm 100% sure that all those negative reviews are from people who didnt even watch the movie or even worse from DC fans who hate marvel!!! That's by far the best movie in the last couple of decades in terms of everything the movie industry could offer So please ignorant reviewers be fair or dont write anything better Thanks marvel for such an amazing 10 years,10
Lives up to the hype!,27 April 2018,"This was truly spectacular!! A lot more (excellent) humor than I perhaps expected, although it lessens when it goes down for some great emotional moments. And A LOT of shit goes down. the action set pieces are amazing and a lot of fun to watch.

Thanos is also easily up there as one of the best and most menacing villains seen so far. I loved what they did with Peter Dinklage!

That said, I can easily imagine the movie being hard to follow for those not well versed with the MCU, however, I think they do a pretty good job switching between the different groups.

I'll definitely be rewatching this in the near future.",10

The Russo Brothers Pulled It Off,27 April 2018,"No spoilers here - jut my reasons I enjoyed the film.

Story = 10 Acting = 10 CGI = 10 Plot = 10 Execution = 10

This was the best super hero movie to date. All of the individual story line movies deal with issues on a small scale. Avengers 1 was the first time we saw that scale stepped up a notch which is why is worked so well. Subsequently, that is where the issues lied in Avengers 2 (although it was still a ""good"" movie.)

The scale of this movie both excited and scared me. I felt nervous coming into this movie because I knew how hard this movie was going to be to pull off. The movie executed on all those metrics I listed above, but it was also funny and heartfelt without being cheesy. I have always felt that is the biggest challenge not only in superhero movies, but in all movies.",10
My first review,26 April 2018,"No spoilers.



From the first second to the very last, you will be on edge. Anticipating, scared, laughing, crying, excited. Credit to the writers, directors, actors, every single person who has worked on this film and every Marvel film before it. You have built a world that is simply incredible.

And Thanos? Well, he demands your silence.",10

For those who haven't watched yet, book your tickets right now and those who have already watched will know what i am talking about. The hype was more than Ever. The Excitement was more than ever. Infinity war was filled with Emotions, Comedy, drama and Action. I don't think there was any scene where i wasn't excited or drawn into. Goosebumps never left my body until the movie was Over. The fight Scenes were just Amazing to watch. We got a Villain, who held his own in front of our Heros. The level of Acting was just out of the world. The Comic timing got Everyone in the theater laughing out of their seats, the intense drama got everyone Emotional. It would be hard to wait for the next part but i guess it's worth it. Avengers - Infinity war was not an Experience, It was a Life Event.",10
It's all been leading to this...,27 April 2018,"Ten years ago, the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) was birthed with Iron Man, a supremely confident film which resurrected a career and started a shared universe of unprecedented proportions. Eighteen films later and an impressive number of superheroes introduced on the roster so far, we arrive at Avengers: Infinity War, a film so hugely anticipated that even hiding under a rock wouldn't let you escape it.

With relationships shattered after the events of Captain America: Civil War, the Avengers must team up with the Guardians of the Galaxy to put a stop to Thanos (Josh Brolin), a mad titan hell bent on collecting all the Infinity Stones and bringing balance to the universe.

The Russo brothers were the ones handed the unenviable task of bringing together pretty much every single superhero introduced so far in the MCU and having them share the screen without the film becoming a complete mess. Having achieved such great things with Captain America: Civil War, there was nobody I'd rather have take on the challenge. Now with Avengers: Infinity War, they've managed to deliver a non-stop thrill ride that is well and truly worth the ten years of character and story building it took to get to this point.

Due to the balancing act of reintroducing characters and the film's narrative, things do take a little amount of time to really get going however, it's very much a necessity and it makes for such a worthwhile second act as our heroes team up to take on Thanos. Thor coming across the Guardians of the Galaxy and Doctor Strange trying to tame Tony Stark's ego, both sets meeting for the first time, makes for an entertaining adventure and once again proves that these MCU films are at their best when these characters interactions are played out so well.

When it comes to the action side of things, driven by superior visual effects and such ferocious scale, Infinity War is one of the craziest films I've ever laid my eyes upon. The team-ups that play out in this film are exciting enough but then the moments that the Russo brothers deliver with them take them to the next level. It's really expected in today's cinema to see such grand visual effects, particularly in action sequences, but what really stunned me was how incredible Thanos looked, the detail in his features making him so much more of an intimidating figure. More on that guy later.

Infinity War features probably the most A-list cast of all time so you'd expect them all to get a major amount of screen time for this film to run smoothly. It's shared as equally as possible, some getting a bit more to do than others, and it's a tactic that pays off, both in terms of narrative and spectacle. Robert Downey Jr. has been synonymous with the role of Iron Man for the past ten years but it doesn't stop him from giving it his all here, the combination of his assurance and naivety as Iron Man making for a dangerous cog in the Avengers wheel as they suit up to take on Thanos. I could go through all the performances but Downey Jr.'s is the one out of the heroes that stood out for me.

I mentioned how Thanos is brought to life through amazing visual effects earlier but none of it would be possible without Josh Brolin's motion-capture performance in the role. Thanos takes no time in showing just how much trouble the Avengers are in, his physical presence obviously giving him a bit of an advantage however, Brolin's voice work and facial expressions bring a whole new dimension to the character. Furthermore, Thanos is given plenty of screen time to delve into a bit of his backstory, adding an emotional weight and gravitas which in turn leads to him becoming one helluva villain, the best in the MCU by a mile.

Avengers: Infinity War is event cinema at its finest, the balance of comedy and drama works wonders, as do these characters forced together to fight the true evil threatening the universe. There's plenty of crowd-pleasing moments as well as a fair share of crowd-shocking moments, the Russo brothers closing the film out rather brilliantly. Don't forget though, there's more to come when the Avengers return next year so, for now, it's time to take a deep breath and think about what you've just witnessed.",10
An entertaining parade,12 May 2019,"This movie is colorful, entertaining and sometimes funny but I really don't understand why it is getting so good reviews.

Firstly, the bad guy has no charisma since he's just another pile of polygons without true facial expression. His cruaulty is absurd and his true purpose is elusive. This is a really boring character.

The visual effects fills 98% of the movie but it's still just above average. For example, the iron Man and Spiderman bodies are fake and disturbing with their faces floating on it. Too much visual effects kills the visual effects. Finally, this outbidding of characters is really exhausting. They all fly like a pierced balloon and shoot ineffective missiles for 2 hours. This isn't a movie, this is a parade.",6
Exactly what I was hoping for and what I've been waiting for,2 July 2018,"I enjoy the whole Marvel comic universe thing they have going on now as to me having beloved characters I have seen in the comics and were a part of my childhood on the big screen is simply amazing. Then, like a comic book, I can be watching one characters film and another hero can appear. I loved crossover comics and I love crossover movies as well! This film features several comic book characters and Thanos, whom I have been anticipating in a Marvel movie since they teased him in the original Avengers film. I was disappointed a bit by the second Avengers film (still enjoyed it overall) as they went with Ultron as the villain and then later got more disappointed when I read somewhere that the Abomination was originally going to be in the film, but they scrapped the idea. That would have really given that film the kick it needed. This one though was not a disappointment at all as I got to see Thanos be as totally awesome as he is in the comics and I got to see many of my favorite superheros on the big screen at the same time!

The story has Thanos, the mad titan, collecting infinity stones as he makes quick work of both the Hulk and Thor! The Asgardian ship seen in the previous Thor film is decimated as Thanos collects yet another stone and soon sends his children to Earth to collect the stone within Vision's forehead and the one protected by Dr. Strange. Thanos, himself, goes to the collector to retrieve the stone left in the Collector's care. Tony Stark ends up getting a warning from old friend Bruce Banner who gets back to Earth thanks to Heimdall and soon the children of Thanos make their attack as Tony must once again don the Iron Man armor to fight off these attackers and try to protect Dr. Strange's time stone. He gets some help from his friendly neighborhood protege, but all three end up on the ship of this weird dude who has very powerful telekinetic powers. Bruce Banner is left on Earth and he makes the call to Captain America who has to try and hold off the hordes of creatures that come for Vision's stone and does so by going to Wakanda where he will get the aid of the Black Panther and his old friend. Meanwhile, the Guardians of the Galaxy recover Thor and soon Thor, Groot and Rocket go to a place where Thor can get a powerful weapon to fight Thanos, while the rest of the Guardians try to stop Thanos at the Collector's. The power Thanos wields though is truly terrifying and things keep becoming vastly more difficult for all the heroes!

The thing I enjoyed most was seeing all the different heroes interacting together. I was not expecting Dr. Strange, Spider-man or the Guardians to be in the film as much as they were. I was expecting more like extended cameos. I enjoyed watching Iron Man and the group on Titan fighting Thanos as they did a really amazing job of combating him. The only thing I wish there was more of is Captain America as he just did not really factor into the movie much at all being a bit ineffective. I also want him back with his regular shield too! Still, just a minor complaint in a movie that completely wowed me for the most part.

So yes, this was a very good comic book movie. I do believe I enjoyed it more than the first Avenger film which I also loved as this one was just so overwhelming and did so many cool things. This one also featured the best villain in Thanos, who they did really good with, making him almost sympathetic at times. The action was great in this one as all the battles were totally off the chain and as I said watching Dr. Strange, Iron Man and Starlord together on the same screen was simply great. I look forward to the next Avengers film coming thankfully next year. At first I thought it was not coming out until 2020, that would have been a very difficult wait!",10
Fun movie with no brains,26 September 2018,"Strengths -Every comic book reader's wet dream -Visually the movie is nice -Entertaining action sequences -Follows multiple characters along different paths so you don't get bored fast

Weaknesses -Like every other superhero movie, it caters to the younger audiences, which isn't a bad thing, but adults may find it too silly -Story is too simple -Too many jokes & comic relief characters -""Shocking"" ending",6
Just an awful waste of 2.5 hours,6 May 2018,"I don't typically write reviews; however, someone needed to balance out the over the top love for this bad plotted film with way too many stars. For me, it all comes down to this question: ""Can this movie stand alone without having seen at least 75% of the other Marvel movies?"" The answer is NO! I know I've seen most of Marvel's movies (loved Black Panther) but I think to enjoy this film you have to be a serious Marvel fan. Even with as many of the Marvel movies that I've seen, I still didn't have enough back story or character recognition to pull together this plot which seemed to me to just be an excuse to have CGI battles over and over. Then, to make matters worse, it's sooo looong. Add to that, that I need to see a sequel to see how this story ends and I hate it - 1 star out of 10 - done and done.",1

The culmination and greatest tragedy of MCU hitherto.,28 April 2018,,10
War for the Universe,6 May 2018,"The thing about conflict is it goes both ways, no matter how well trained we are to not lose, no matter how many battles triumphed, death and loss are never far away.

This is one of my favorite sequels of all time up there with ""The Empire Strikes Back"" in my book, it's also believe it or not my favorite Avengers film (at least for now, till the next one comes out). This film really is something not just is it a big event but it's also the darkest entry in the franchise and MCU, as it is the most epic but also the most tragic. Though the film is fitting as it's takes place in the MSU's 10th Anniversary and through the years it has build itself of to this, and I'll just say it's one hell of a pay off.

Characters are good each have good moments: Thor and Peter Quill/Star lord stand out for me I really felt both were at their best on an emotional basis, from what both have to endure it's interesting seeing both of them really pissed, it really drives both of them to do what must be done and you really route for them doing it.

Though who also stand out are Scarlet Witch and The Vision, both characters I honestly felt we're really at their best. I really like that you get a little depth on their relationship as we see how far they have can for themselves and each other. It's really touching which is also what makes what they endure all the sadder; I honestly wanted both to somehow find a way to survive but there were no guarantees.

However, the one character that stands out in the whole film and that we're all really here for is Thanos. Josh Brolin is just fantastic as Thanos, this is probably my favorite role from him; it just fit like a glove for him (no pun intended). I really love the physicality as well as emotionality of his performance, let alone voice which is spot on I actually did imagine that is what Thanos would sound like. Strangely this film is sort of his movie, he truly is the main character throughout the film. Which is cool, Thanos is one of my favorite fictional villians of all time not just is he terrifying but he's the most complex as he is three dimensional.

The most interesting thing about him is he doesn't perceive himself as a villain, he honestly feels what he is doing is right, that it's for the universe's own good as he feels by destroying a certain number of worlds that are heading toward failure, he can save several other worlds in the universe so there would be an harmonious balance. He's actually aware his actions breach ethical boundaries but to him they are necessary evils to accomplish what he sets himself out to do.

I even like seeing the emotionality to him as you see from his eyes and voice a lot of anger but also a lot of sadness, as if this guy carries an emotional weight that is as heavy and large as his size as you see this is a person that has endure more than his share of loss. Which fuels his rage as it seems he despises it more than any enemy he fights. I also like that there is a bit of this unpredictability about him, you're not always sure what he's about to do until he does it which can kind of catch you off guard.

And of course, his trademark weapon The Infinity Gauntlet is just awesome, it's one of my favorite fictional weapons as that gauntlet with all the stones in place lets you weld God Like Powers. With all six stones intact, you could do just about anything you want, I won't say what you have to see for yourself to believe.

I really like the story format and the pace in it is great as it's really fast, despite how long the film actually is I honestly didn't notice the time which is a good sign. At first, it's sort of an adventure as we see things taking place in both space and earth, and it's practically a race for the stones. There is kind of a double layer suspense where on one hand your hoping the Avengers will find the stones before Thanos, but on another hand your kind of are quietly routing for Thanos to find those stones because let's face it we deep down really want to see what each of them can do. And once we see Thanos utilize those stones it doesn't disappoint, it's kind of a payoff for each and every plight.

And then the film turns into you could say a war movie, in the final half it gets into one of my favorite battles of all time let alone one of the longest as it clocks in about 30-40 mins. It is just absolute pandemonium as we see left, right up and down there are actually two different battles taking place. One in space with Thanos and a group of Avengers and another on earth against Thanos's forces and the secondary group of Avengers. It's almost like seeing a live action ""Where Waldo"" art illustration as there are just things happening all around the characters and you've got just most of the character from the Marvel Verse involved.

In the battles there are some really cool moments from Thor getting his new hammer which I'm glad, I know that in the last film ""Thor Ragnorok"" he's fully harnessed his power of lightening but it's just not the same, that hammer is his trademark and is just really cool seeing him kick ass with it. Which he does in this film and you can see from the ferocity of his actions he's really mad now. Or even Bruce Banner in that Hulk Buster, I thought it was really cool for once seeing Bruce doing the ass kicking and not relying on the Hulk all the time, it just shows he's no wimp Bruce truly can hold his own against danger.

But I like that you see the battle isn't one sided, it really looks like things can go either way. We see the Avengers kicking ass as usual but also, we see Thanos and his forces at times get the upper hand and turn things around. Times like that really made me worried for the lives of the characters, despite the Avengers abilities they're not bullet or knife proof. You really get that wavering feeling you have where at times you feel a glimmer of hope but then gets crushed, you can say by Thanos fist.

The score by one of my favorite composers Alvin Sivelstri is good, though it's really the end theme song that is the most memorable and is probably one of my favorite end themes ever. I won't say what kind of theme it is, but I'll just say just like what happens at the end it will hit you really hard.

From here I've said enough, and I'll just say one last thing, a battle may be won but the war is far from over.

But I love the idea of every MCU superhero coming together to fight the battles that they never could.

The culmination of 10 years of Marvel films to this absolute blockbuster smash hit of a film. Marvel is in top form in this film and the Russo brothers knocked it out of the park.

But it is not completely perfect nor without it's faults, nonetheless it is one of the best in the MCU. Also that ending probably one of the satisfyingly shocking endings in the MCU, I will never forget the stunned silence of the packed auditorium I was in during the conclusion of this film.

But my worries has come true. would it be enough to put twenty something superheroes including bring together some of them for the first time, telling a lot of jokes (some of them REALLY unfunny and appeared at a bad timing), intorducing the three dimesional character that Thanos possess, some great battle sequence, and then finding the stones, and actually a lot more. well, somehow they managed to push them into 2 and a half hours film, but it felt rushed. the relationship between Thanos and his daughter Gamora felt so plastic even though that is one of the tools for the audience to get to know Thanos better. and a lot more issues. but it;s still a cool and very risky film to make, dozens of stars, more than 3 complex plots filled with different characters that contrast to each others, i still have to give it a props. and the ending is worth waiting btw, really breathtaking.",6

AMAZING,13 August 2018,"This movie is absolutly amazing. The history proves that once you try to make more than few heroes an more than one storyline, the movie become mess. But brothers russo created an amazing movie with deep, emotional story that the last 10 has led to, with over 30 characters they created a stable running plot that does not stop for a secound. Thanos is one of cinema best bad guys ever with a real agenda and complex conflicts that make it very complicated to not agree and the deep of the character made Thanos-the villain to movie main character and he is the one who gives the tune for the movie. Visually, the movie is avsoulotly georges. The visual effects and characters customs look just real and i have no complain for it I have no bad word to say about the movie so go and see it.",10

The plot is expertly crafted, weaving together various storylines and characters in a seamless and satisfying way.

Thanos made this movie one of the greatest ever.,4 August 2018,"Since I have watched a lot of films & anime, I rarely am excited at the movies. But the great Titan Thanos has blown my jaded mind to pieces. A must watch masterpiece, not just for the story or action or direction, but for how well balanced & entertaining it was.",10
Why?,13 June 2018,,10
Amazeballs,5 August 2018,"Going to keep this short. Probably the best action movie of the year, if not ever. Has all of the Marvel Superheroes mashed up just like the comics do when massive scale events happen. This last statement takes me to all the negative reviews. Why oh why?? You guys do realise it is Part 1 of 2 right??

Before you give it a 1 star because, oh well you have no idea about the actual MU and MCU. I suggest you at least google ""Infinity Gauntlet"" which is the original story of Thanos, also the actual Infinity War from the comics.

I am not providing any spoilers here since what I have mentioned can be seen in the trailers and synopsis, what I did mention was based on Marvel Universe knowledge. No idea which route the directors will take but please bear with the 2nd part before you tell people not to ""waste"" their time, that this is the last marvel movie or by giving it a score under 5 stars.

Here are the main reason why this movie doesn't deserve the under 7 reviews it got:

1) It is a 2 part movie so bear with it until you actually watch the second part? 2.a) Huge, massive scale event in the Marvel Universe. Due to Thano's goal every being in the known/unknown Universe WILL come to take him down. Frankly the movie didn't have every Superhero Character in existence, for example the X-Men and Fantastic 4. 2.b) The supreme beings of the Marvel Universe; an all-star lineup including Galactus, Kronos, Epoch, the Living Tribunal, and a bunch of others like the personifications of concepts like Chaos and Order come after him. 3) Many many people and superheroes would have not realised what Thanos did until after he snapped his fingers. So don't go crying that it is the end of the world. 4) Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.2 - End Credits - Hint hint Adam Warlock. Even though he may not make an appearance in the 2nd part. 5) One of the most powerful superheroes in existence and not quite as known should make an appearance in the 2nd part to help out. End credits, Carol Danvers. 6) Following point 3 (for all the whiners), anyone can put the gauntlet on and snap their fingers one more time... and... wait for it, wait for it... undo what has been done.

I hope you enjoy this amazing movie.",10
This is a great movie,4 August 2018,"It's a great time to see the movie in theaters, even if you didnt go, go buy the digital copy or blu ray and use surround sound if have a speaker system. About the film this is very entertaining, I recommend to anybody who saw the last 3 movies",9

Great fun!,24 May 2018,"This was a great movie for the fact that you forgot your troubles for 2.5 hours and could watch some awesome heroes and villains clash in an epic war! I'll break it down as follows!

Reasons it was cool: Visually pleasing and smooth CGI (minus Bruce Banner's head in the hulk iron man suit [WTF?]) Thanos looked good though!

Great mesh of the different characters (Thor and Guardians of the Galaxy).

I enjoyed the emphasis on Thanos as his story is quite interesting; naturally a stand-alone movie would be nice.

This movie raised the stakes! Maybe our heroes AREN'T as immortal as we thought?

Reasons it was not cool:

Criminal underuse and screen time for some of the cooler Marvel characters like Dr. Strange, Captain America, and Black Panther. I get that it is an ensemble film on steroids, but felt shortchanged with regards to them in particular.

Thanos seemed overpowered at times, not allowing for enough actual war or conflict

The ending (will not spoil) loses some of its impact when you realize the other Marvel movies coming out.",7

Infinity War Provides Infinite Disappointment,28 April 2018,"After ten years of epic waiting, we just got a chance to clarify that The Russo Brothers were an awful choice for Marvel Cinametic Universe. Infinity War, including over 30 main characters, starts with a quick plot without losing time to introduce our heroes. The movie goes on with funny bits popping out of nowhere during non-stop action sequences and sends us back home with a terrible ending. Suprisingly, it is not only bad because of lack of drama, but also the glorious fight between Avengers and Thanos brings out nothing original. The movie may serve as a great entertainment for early teens and comic-book fans, but surely not beyond that.",1

Absolutely exquisite and mind blowing,27 April 2018,"This truly Blew me away, I honestly expected to be disappointed but... that couldn't be further from the truth. The direction that they took was so well executed. I will need to see it again and again. I truly love this movie!",10
"Whatever you're expecting, it's not that.",27 April 2018,"Wow.

I just got out of a Thursday night premier, and i have to say... I haven't had a pit of dread in my stomach leaving a Marvel movie before. Ever.

The rest of the movie is great, meaningful action and development happens, it's all great.

But the final stretch... It's a doozy. Like I said in the title, whatever theories you have about the end... Just throw them away. Walk into this movie with an open mind and try and prepare yourself.

This is the darkest Marvel movie so far. I'm anxious to see what the Russo brothers do with Part II next year because I don't know what they're doing at all. It's great, but you will leave this film feeling emotionally ripped to shreds. And it happens like a punch in the gut.

I've already said too much. Go into it without any spoilers, if you can, and just prepare yourself for Thanos.",9
Ten years all lead to this cinematic masterpiece,13 August 2018,"Before I review the film, a disclaimer might be needed. To fully appreciate this movie, you'll need to have seen at least one of the other avengers films or solo films to be somewhat familiar with the characters, otherwise you'll just end up very confused and not invested.

The anticipation for this movie was through the roof. Not often do you see people that hyped for a movie - especially a superhero themed flick. Avengers: infinity war had a lot to live up to. The film revolves around Thanos, not the avengers, but Thanos is the main character. He definitely is a well created 'villain'. Though I am not sure villain is the right word to describe him. His intentions essentially are good, his method is just a tad morbid. It will make you question your morals, and it makes you think about the state of the earth, which is indeed overpopulated You'll find fans rooting for either Thanos or our heroes

The actors delivered a splendid performance, with heartfelt and realistic reactions to the events around them. The producers may have gone a bit overboard with the CGI, but it's done in such a beautiful and realistic way that you won't even notice.

One of the best things about this movie is that for once, you can't expect a good ending. Anything can happen. Usually with superhero movies you know that the heroes will survive, which takes away the tension. With Infinity War you truly don't know who will survive or not, so that makes every fighting scene very intense.

The soundtrack was exhilarating as well. Marvel is well known for its forgettable soundtracks, but this one was definitely recognisable. The avengers theme blasted through the cinema speakers and it was amazing. The cinematography is gorgeous as well.

The film is amazing, but you do need to be familiar with the characters. There's a lot of things going on in this movie, and there obviously isn't any time to introduce every character. Marvel has spend ten years to set up this epic, so every past film is essential to fully appreciate the grand epic that Infinity War truly is.",10

A culmination of 10 years that (mostly) lives up to the hype,11 August 2018,"Avengers: Infinity War is something that, on the first watch, you're absolutely blown away by. You walk out of the theater satisfied. It acts as a reward for sticking with the MCU and it does deliver.

What I appreciate most is the fact that while this is certainly the avengers' movie, it's also the main villain Thanos' story.

One thing that this may seem is overstuffed. It's a lot to take in, certainly, and with so many characters to fit in, of course it's going to seem that way. There certainly could have been some improvements to the story, but overall the plot was well done.

The direction is what stands out. The Russo brothers have crafted an addition that truly serves as a fantastic piece of blockbuster action while remaining faithful to the previous MCU directors.

One last thing I don't normally compliment: the CGI and visual affects were on point. Marvel has never had a real problem with it in the past, but this was just plain amazing. One of the most visually dazzling films of this last year.

Avengers: Infinity War is a culmination of 10 years of good films that mostly lives up to the hype. (8/10)",8
"6.5/10 - Cool Premise, Many Flaws",23 November 2021,"Vengers: Infinity War. To call the thing that surrounded this film ""hype"" would be an understatement. The world went nuts. Marvel have built this huge cinematic universe, and Infinity War was the climax (or maybe the beginning of it, considering Endgame), but anyway, yeah. It was a huge success, people love it, everybody talked about it, even people who haven't seen all the previous Marvel movies have tried to watch it (btw, this is a good time to say: DON'T DO IT. IT DOESN'T MATTER IF IT'S CONSIDERED TO BE THE BEST MCU FILM BY MANY, DON'T WATCH IT FIRST.) It was everywhere. I, myself, have seen it on cinema, which was a pretty cool experience.

But though I used to really love this film, I'm gonna be straightforward here - I find now many flaws in it that I haven't noticed in 2018. Maybe because then I was just really hyped, maybe because watching some true masterpieces made me more sensitive to this stuff, but still - I like it way less than I used to. It's still a nice film though, and an important one for sure, but it's far from being a masterpiece in my eyes. I'd also like to state before the review that I'm not LOOKING for flaws, but rather...I point out the things that truly bothered me. I don't say it ofter, but this time I feel like I should before people will say that I'm nitpicking and not writing what I truly feel about it.

I usually like to start my review with a quick summary of the plot, but here I feel like I can't do it in an efficient way, maybe because all of the context needed. Let's try amyway, something like this: Infinity War tells the story of how all Earth's heroes combine their forces to fight the ""final boss"" of the MCU - Thanos, the mad titan. As he gatheres more and more power, infinity stone after infinity stone, the threat on the universe grows bigger and bigger. Will the Avengers stop him, or will half the universe perish?

Let's start with what I like, shall we?

I think that the dark moments and the generally darker, hopeless vibe that the film has at points is really refreshing in the MCU. I like how the risk is truly felt and emphasized here.

The soundtrack is fitting, I guess? A bit over dramatic from time to time, but there are a lot of overdramatic points in the film so whatever, it's fitting.

Thanos is quite a good villain, and I do like the way that his character was discovered in Infinity War.

And I mean, the general idea, bringing everything together in a big way, is still an idea that I can appreciate a lot. There are also a lot of cool moments, whether funny or simply epic, but they are scattered across the film and I don't wanna spoil anything so I'll say that stating it as it is is enough.

Oh, and some monologues here are quite well written. There are many cool one-liners, and I especially like the opening scene, actually.

Now, the things that bothered me - I'll start with criticizing just the general tone that this film takes from time to time, the general careless, goofy and a little awkward Marvel-humor tone. You know what I'm talking about. And I don't think that every Marvel joke is bad, or that it can't work, but in the context of Infinity War it just feels kinda like atmosphere-breakers, like Marvel don't wanna risk in being serious for too long. Most jokes here aren't that funny, and are quite out of place imo.

Besides of growing tired of the MCU humor during moments in which it's unnecessary, I also find myself picking on more plot holes, more ""oh, how convenient that this character was here"" type of things, and it just doesn't work that well when you overuse it, like here.

Also, the cinematography feels a little to shaky, chaotic, confusing. There are some good shots here and there, but for me, at least, the camera handling and the general way that each shot was filmed was pretty off, for most of the runtime.

I also feel like the pacing was a bit off, and there where point when it was too fast or dragging, but this is not like a horrible flaw here, just another thing that bothered me. And that's about it for the things that bothered me, the flaws.

So, yeah, let's sum it up. Even though it has many, many flaws, I do generally enjoy this film. The premise, the epicness and cool, memorable moments (+the dark atmosphere that was cut WAY too often) make it an enoyable film for me, but I can't say that it's a good one or that I truly love it. It's just a fine, nice movie for me, and that's all. I'm feeling a 6.5/10 on this one.",6

I love both of them to death and if you are a real fan then you will love this movie. now the review: I felt the same amazement when i watched the Avengers 1, you wont realise where your time went. It is entertaining, engaging, has a good story and actually makes you feel for the villain. Thanos is a worthy villain who actually has a motive which even you will agree at some point. the cgi is amazing, it feels so real. the movie is less funny than other marvel movies and i thank the russo brothers for that.

OVER RATED,28 April 2018,"Avengers infinity wars is by far the most over rated movie I have ever seen I don't understand how it could possibly be the 9th highest rated movie above classics like goodfellas Star Wars a new hope fight club and lord of the rings firstly it's a marvel film which means the plot is very basic a bad guy tries to ""put an end to the universe"" there's been over 67 marvel films with the same plot marvel simply tricks people yong and old to spend money on the same movie 67 times with the only difference being the costume the movie it's self had to many characters and not enough time With some characters such as black panther being seen for probably just over 20 minutes in the 2 and a half hours this film went for being mostly focused on the guardians of the galaxy characters and not the original avengers Thor hulk captain America and iron man overall it was an alright movie thats abit rushed and slightly repetitive (((mild spoiler below))) most people would know from spoilers on Facebook that certain characters might die but I would just like to say that the characters that everyone assumes dies don't actually since one of the characters that appear to die have a sequel of their movie coming out next year",6
Below average movie,8 May 2018,,2
Don't get your hopes down yet,30 April 2018,,9
Unprecedented,29 April 2018,"The two things that Marvel movies have always been under criticism for are their villains and lack of stakes. Not only does Infinity War put those criticisms away, it takes full advantage of the gravitas of the comic book it's based on. I can't really imagine a better way that the MCU could have closed out a 19 movie arc, while also perfectly setting up the final (for now) installment next May.

In one of the gutsiest and deadliest superhero films to date, The Russo Brothers have once again delivered a meaningful and thought provoking entry into the MCU. I don't know how they did it, but they managed to give all 30 something characters time to shine while also giving several of the big Avengers or Guardian related characters an impactful arc of their own. There are very minute pacing issues that perhaps some casual fans may take issue with, but for someone who has been with this universe from the beginning, I ate it all up. I'm not sure there are any directors who could have possibly executed this story as well as The Russo brothers did.

As with Age of Ultron, I worried that the tone of the trailers (dark and serious) wouldn't really translate to the movie, as the MCU is known for its humor. Ultron was a very funny movie but it still felt like a missed opportunity to not have a little more emotional weight to that story. Luckily, Infinity War brilliantly balances humor, heart, and some serious sh*t that goes down in this adventure-heist-thriller.

Much like its comic-book counterpart, Infinity War follows Thanos (and it's largely his story) and his quest for the 6 Infinity stones which gives him the power to wipe out half the universe. How can you possibly give someone like that shades of humanity and an understandable motivation? Well somehow they did it, and when Thanos or someone else does things that bring the emotion out of him, it's some of the best sequences of the film.

Most impressively, the Russo's and the writers figured out a way to pick up where we left each character while also making it fit into an Avengers story that needed them to more specific things related to a bigger threat. In other words, this film is driven by characters and not plot. As much as I love Age of Ultron, it feels more like a film that had their characters act based on where the filmmakers wanted the plot to go (i.e. Thor's quest in the middle of the film). Infinity War is far from that, and is clearly structured by filmmakers who still have stories left to tell in this universe.

I could go on and on about specific plot elements, scene stealers, surprises, and the bold direction the film takes, but I decided to take a more vague approach to this review to not spread the spoilery thoughts that the internet has been filled with the past few days. In short, Infinity War is the most balls to the wall film Marvel has ever done, but still fills it with brilliantly quiet moments that made Civil War and Winter Soldier so groundbreaking.

An uncomfortable review of a great movie,4 May 2018,"Let me start by saying I am your average viewer who kinda likes super hero movies and doesn't like crap super hero movies. I thought the first Avengers was ok whatever, Avengers: Age of Ultron was super boring. The first Iron man was good, all the others super sucked. Dr Strange was pretty good, and Batman vs Superman was pretty crap, just saying.

Now that you have a sense of what I like, please listen.

I was expecting another Avengers movie where I come out thinking ya whatever it was an ok movie, and I don't know what I watch these movies, knowing they usually suck. I am stupid but hey its a movie

But after watching this, I very uncomfortable have to say, this is one of the best Avengers, nay best Super Hero movies I have ever seen, Yup I said it, I just cringe saying these words, but I must. Everything in this movie is great, so great that I will say it is the benchmark by which all super hero movie should be made now.

Its just soooooooo good, I never thought I would say this about a Super Hero Movie, what have I become, what have you made me into Marvel, what is this feeling

WATCH THIS MOVIE, thats it",9
Quite over hyped,13 August 2020,"It's ok but people calling it a ""masterpiece"" is just wrong. A saying that I completely agree with is that less like a film but more like an event. I think the hype is elevating it to an unfair status.",6
I cried so much,28 April 2018,"Obviously since this is Thanos we're talking about here I knew the first part wouldn't be as much of a happy ending, but I never expected this. There was of course plenty of action packed scenes, comedic relief, and I was surprised with how well they were able to keep the story going while it was surrounded with SO many different characters. So yes, it was one of the most tragic things I've watched (because I grew up in marvel stuff) but it was such a good movie and I'm so ready for the finale!!!!",10
Too much in one film,3 May 2019,"I'm not a Marvel fan, but the films before I did like because of the humor and nice storyline. But this film started like I missed out on a movie, but I found out I didn't. There's too much going on, it's an overkill on action. Ok, the action is actually very good, but it is way too much. So my tolerance for Marcel ends here. But ok, I will watch the last one. Only to see how it ends...",6
A passable film but still needs more...I can't put my finger on it,1 May 2018,"Not to be cerebral because this movie is not that. I had to put my input as well and agree that this film does not deserve a high rating as IMDb's users are placing it to be. This movie is tiring in both a good and bad way. Too much action crammed in a 2.5 hour movie. This story should have been serialized or someplace like Netflix where they can hash out a story in an episodic format, like a comic book. I agree with others with plot holes, but we must remember that this is a comic book movie and you have to expect that. I see where certain Hollywood producers are criticizing the comic book film genre and the constant release of these films. I feel that the genre has peaked with this movie.",5
Superb - Intense - Expectations exceeded,30 April 2018,"Having been a recent convert to the MCU, I had only watched five or so of the more than dozen movies over the past few years. With the advent of Movies Anywhere, I collected all of them and watched them in the past month.

I went into Avengers: Infinity War with pretty high expectations. Thanos had to be the ultimate villain that was not only calculating, but immensely powerful. The different heroes had to play off each other's abilities well. And the stakes had to be high. Very high.

Well, the Russo brothers and Kevin Feige more than delivered. This film not only met all those expectations, but delivered more, giving us a complex character in Thanos, and not pulling ANY punches on the way to the 'end game', and having an ending that left me completely stunned.

It literally took me an evening and the next morning to process everything I had watched... something that is a hallmark of a good film. Totally 11/10.",10
Good fun but ultimately one big Deus ex machina,26 April 2018,,8
"Not perfect, but Breath-taking!",26 April 2018,"Avengers Infinity War isn't perfect, but it sure is one hell of a ride! This is a spoiler free review. I'll start off with elements that did not work for me (or at least, I thought, could've been better). There are a few VFX shots (such as fully-CGI characters, noticeable green screens, etc.) in the film that looked quite unpolished, but mostly very small aspects. But then again, the scope of the film is so huge that it seems impossible to fully render every element on every frame. Another element that felt quite lacking, for me, was the character development (especially for newcomers such as the Children of Thanos, and some heroes). No spoilers, but the purpose of the Black Order in the film is ultimately to serve as a physical threat for the heroes. Most of our beloved heroes have very little screen-time in this installment, both for the best and worse. However, there are some characters who get to shine more in this one.

Now, let's talk about what's great about the film! Surprise, surprise, surprise. There are tons of awesome surprises for the audience in this film, especially for die-hard MCU fans such as myself. Since 2012, fans have been anticipating to watch the Mad Titan, Thanos, wreak havoc and become a fully-realized, compelling villain. Let me say this: Thanos is easily one of the best MCU villains yet, ranking with the likes of Loki, Vulture and Killmonger. I would even say he's one of the best villains in a superhero movie ever. There's some emotional depth to the character, reinforced by Josh Brolin's amazing motion-capture performance and intricate details to his expressions and movements. Thanos truly dominates every frame he's in. Now, I want to give tons of credit to the writers (McFeely and Markus) and directors (the Russo Brothers) for giving Thanos such great care and purpose. Infinity War is ultimately Thanos' story, without questions. That is why, perhaps, some may feel that their favorite characters were under-used in the film. Ten years of build-up, and the Mad Titan gets the justice he deserves. While some characters take a back seat for the duration of the film, there are some who really get to shine (Iron Man's new suit is sick, Dr. Strange is more powerful than ever, Gamora plays quite a crucial role, and Thor!!!) Great character interactions (especially Dr. Stange, Spider-Man and Iron Man). The action sequences were fantastic - some work better than others. The final act of the film, in particular, was breath-taking. It genuinely felt like the MCU was at its peak. A couple of gut-wrenching moments scattered throughout the film. Tom Holland delivers one of the most heart-breaking performances in the MCU. Avengers: Infinity War truly felt like an action-packed, emotional and thrilling epic that will leave fans stunned and wanting more.",9
Exceeds Expectations,28 April 2018,"It's a blast when a film not only meets expectations, but exceeds them. This uses the whole toolkit that the Marvel films have accumulated over the years, and finds exactly the right mix of familiar and new, humor and drama. It's like a runaway freight train but it knows that and does nothing to take away from the rush of being on board. Great stuff.

As far as specifics, the new combinations of characters are a joy, it's confident and intrepid visually and the rationale of why the villain is doing what he does comes across better than one would expect. There are a couple of scenes that seem contrived to push a lever for the story, but in such a grand scheme, hardly worth mentioning. This is far better than Age of Ultron, a real return to form for the Avengers.",9
Best. Movie. Of. The. Year!!!!!,4 May 2018,Wooooow. Loved it!!!! Was disappointed that I was left hanging at the endbecause I Didn't realize there would be a part 2. But this movie kept me on the edge of my seat throughout the whole viewing.,10
A must watch MCU,1 May 2018,The movie lives up to all the created hype and it destroys all the fan theories and predictions. Its a continuation of 18 movies and 10 years so if you havn't watched all the previous movie. Then THANOS WANTS YOU TO STAY HOME.,10

Best Marvel Movie Yet!,1 May 2018,,9
Sorry not 8.5,23 February 2019,To be honest a lot of what I want to say is already said by other but one thing i like to add . I loved thanos he has reasons and motivation so few villains do but so much wrong in this story so many characters dead without any good reason so many stories not told because they want to fit 20 characters in one movie i think it would have been good movie if the movie is 5 hours long but i didn't enjoy this at all . And stop the pathos (cheap comedy),6
Overrated,6 July 2018,,1
Brilliant!!!!,30 April 2018,"This movie has been worked towards for 10 years. Many, were afraid that it would not live up to expectations. However, I am proud to say that it exceeded every expectation. This movie is brilliant. The acting, the storyline, it all came it all came together in a MARVELous movie. What makes this movie so good is that it surprises. It breaks away from the traditional superhero ways. All in all, it's tremendous",9
"Epic, exciting, and Loaded",13 May 2018,,9
Nothing Can Prepare You For This Cinematic Event of A Life Time,26 April 2018,"Nothing can prepare you for this cinematic event of a life time. With 10 years of ambitious story telling and a teased villain, it's finally here!

It's time to assemble the team! We have Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Black Widow, Hulk, Doctor Strange, Spider-Man, Scarlet Witch, Vision, the Guardians of the Galaxy, Falcon, War Machine and more because I'm running out of breath!

After 160 minutes of this crazy rollercoaster the only words you'll be saying is ""Woah"", then you'll go straight back to the queue to buy another ticket. Yes infinity War does pay off.

Everyone gets their moments in the limelight. Tony Stark and Peter Parker, there's a fun nod to the movie Aliens and a squid ward joke too! Vision and Scarlet Romance, Bruce Banner talking to Hulk, Guardians meeting Thor and finally Captain and Black Widow, these pairs are a treat to watch. But this isn't all about the avengers, it's more about Thanos and his journey on hunting all 6 Infinity Stones to keep the universe in balance so that he can re-create all of creation in his monstrous image. We get a brief of his past, his lovely Gamora and what he will do to complete his destiny. Let's just say Thanos ""Throws"" away this relationship which has left Gamora feeling ""flat"" hehehehe.

You don't have to view all 18 MCU films, but they do help you keep track on what's going on like where the stones are, who this person is etc. It will make the experience much better and clearer.

This is an impressive achievement that they have accomplish, there's a lot going on this film and it's hard to even do a spoiler free review. There are so many glorious moments in this film, from the jokes and banter to the insane action sequences in Wakanda and Thanos himself. I love how he starts off with armour then every time he collects a stone, a piece is fallen off. I even like the different abilities the gunlet has, it's nothing like you have ever seen before. But by far my favourite scene is the ending, it just ends. It may feel unfinished or feel like a half film, but it's more of a emotional punch that you'll never get over with.",9
So in the end: Was it worth it?,1 May 2018,"""Avengers: Infinity War"" is awesome. Surprisingly, much beauty arises in its imperfection. ""Infinity War"" embodies the catharsis of the superhero tale of The Avengers. The visuals are dazzling; the battles have never been more spectacular or more costly. Despite having way too many superheroes in this 2 hour 40 minute experience, what makes ""Infinity War"" so compelling is the villain Thanos.

Charismatic and sad Josh Brolin gifts the amazing motion capture performance of galactic warrior Thanos, the hulking man-like creature Son of Saturn's Moon Titan. I agree with my buddy Marc: I get who Thanos is. As a child he watched his vibrant Titan die, due to over population; thus exhausting its resources. That was his epiphany. Thanos ""adopts"" daughters Gamora, played by Zoe Saldana, and Nebula, played by Karen Gillan, on his merciless conquests across the universe.

Now the feared warrior Thanos possesses the Infinity Gauntlet, the golden mechanical glove with the Infinity Stones. When he possesses all six stones, he will have the power to wipe out half of all humanity with the snap of his finger. In his own enlightened twist way, he believes that he is benevolent. That is he for the greater good.

At the narrative arc of ""Infinity War"" Thanos tells Doctor Strange, master of the Mystic Arts and Earth's defender, played by understated and powerful Benedict Cumberbatch, of killing off half of the known universe with the snap of his finger, ""I call that mercy."" Doctor Strange asks, ""And then what?"" Thanos replies, ""I finally rest...""

Directors Anthony Russo and Joe Russo string a cohesive narrative thread with the inspired screenplay by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, wisely focusing our attention on Thanos. Thus, humanizing him before our eyes. ""Infinity War"" is great, yet not greater than ""Black Panther"". Where ""Black Panther"" was the self-sustained tale of becoming greater, ""Infinity War"" is more the Act 2 of the Avenger's hero morality play.

Even amidst the often tangled story lines of the rift between Robert Downey Jr.' s Iron Man and Chris Evans's Captain America, and Chris Hemsworth's Thor's displacement from his home World Asgaard, ""Infinity War"" is surprisingly and poignantly about the cost of being right; however justified we might be.

In that the Russo Brothers do the little things humanely: child Gamora asks her father Thanos, ""What did it cost?"" Thanos replies, ""Everything."" So was it worth it?

Chris Hemsworth, Benedict Cumberbatch, Zoe Saldana, and Chris Evans rock as Thor, Doc Strange, Gamora, and Captain America - Steve Rogers are amazing. Hemsworth is refreshingly badass as Thor, fueled by his vengeance upon Thanos. Cumberbatch is quiet confidence and wisdom as Doctor Strange, who may possess the key to the actual ""endgame"". Evans always embodies such conviction and earnestness in idealist Captain America. Saldana is so powerful stealing the movie displaying authentic humanity in her love - despise relationship with her father Thanos.

Their personal story resonates above the sometimes distracting number of heroes and splintering narrative threads. So in the end was it worth it for Thanos? Does he get what he really wants? At least for me, I was surprised in ""Avenger: Infinity War"" in a great way. So it was worth it. Even with the totally WTF conclusion, I still have hope. I can't wait to see what happens in May 2019.",9
Best avengers film so far,1 May 2018,The culmination of all that came before. Can't wait for the next one!,10
Everything a summer blockbuster should be,26 April 2018,"This is quite simply phonomenal, unique and stands out to all other marvel movies. I would recommend this to almost anyone.",10
A must watch for all MARVEL Superhero movie buffs ...,4 May 2018,"A must watch for all MARVEL Superhero movie buffs, rest if you cannot resist give a try, you may like it. The movie is funny, has a story (does that matter) and carries one of the best Superhero movie villain in the history of movies (probably). He grabs more screen time than most of the SUPERHEROES in the movie. Moreover, Thanos is a villain who also 'cries'. Surprisingly, the story does not end here, i.e, after over 2 hrs. Yes it has a sequel! I would not be surprised if Thanos is made a SUPERHERO. He has the moves, the voice , the power.",7
Nice movie,20 August 2018,A nice movie to watch. Probably the best marvels movie yet.,9
Good but overpriced,3 May 2018,"So I just got out of cinema. That ending was huge disappointment. Unpredictable yes but disappointing. Even more disappointing- lack of Steve Rogers / Captain America fights. I mean , COME ON, He deserves more than this!!! Thor had the spotlight. I do understand he is god but I like Cap more and I think he deserved another killer fight choreography as in his own movies. This was about the team yes- but I simply like his character the most of all avengers. Thor scene gave me goosebumps I admit. Humor is amazing through all movie. Especially The Guardians. All in all, this movie was entertaining, much better than the first Avengers (which I didn't like) but it's still not perfect. Most characters still look over cartoonised , or simply look like a psp game. The Lord of the rings convinced me long time ago that a fantasy/sci fi movie it doesn't have to look animated. I am not saying it should be 'DC dark' but Marvel must grow up. It's time!! Teenagers will have the most fun of all while watching this, it fits their age in maturity.",7
Can Disney Studios Depart Into The Porn Industry Already?,13 June 2018,"Because guess what, ""Avengers: Infinity War"" is a straight up porn for any fan of cinématography. The plot is as simple, formulaic and stupid as it can get. There is a huge amount of holes, henny. The chemistry between actors (hence acting) is non-existent. All that we get - is a portion of idiotic choices just to excuse the upcoming ""ACTION"". Ye, baby, gimme more... These sweet fireworks and a talking piece of purple CGI is all I need.

These ""Avengers"" might be mentally disabled: can't think OR use abilities OR communicate with each other. Well, at least they succeeded at jabbing one another with some jokes (a benevolent 1 star for this).",1
Marvel's masterpiece,24 January 2019,"Just WOW! One of the best movies of 2019. The Infinity War is thrilling from start to end. The cast, effects, soundtrack, design, camera just everything is spot on .I expected to be disappointed, but this movie delivers on all fronts. Thanos is the best villain ever introduced and thankfully not only feels completely real in the CGI but also capture every last detail of Brolin's performance. The Russo brothers did great job. And that ending blew my mind straight to the universe, AMAZING Marvel's masterpiece.",10

Thanos,6 August 2018,A charismatic soldier and a villain that you can't hate.,10
A bit of a let down,1 May 2018,"I'd waited years for this film, perhaps that's why I felt a bit let down. Over all the acting was great, and the action better, but with dozens of characters struggling for screen time, the movie was rused and hurried from one scene to the next.

The space scenes were excellent, but the plot back on Earth involving the Earth bound heroes could have been handled much better. Perhaps when the second half of this story comes out, I'll change my tune, but I enjoyed the previous two Avengers films much more.",7

all these super hero films...,12 May 2018,"All the hype made me go to a theater to watch this. Well... what can I say, it is just like 200 other super hero films. Iron-man firing missiles, spider-man jumping around, etc. There is a villain, very strong villain... and what it is that he wants......? He wants to kill half of the population. Why? Because he thinks there is too much people! What!? A villain that is worried about the environment..... he must be from the green party, maybe he is vegan. Anyway... No story whatsoever, but 2 hours of action scenes and good effects (my wife was sleeping after 1 hour)... maybe good for teenagers.",1
A Crowd-Pleasing and Shocking Entry,28 April 2018,"With many people speaking about superhero fatigue when it comes to watching movies on the big screen, you'd think that we'd be in a box office drought by now. Obviously, that isn't coming anytime soon, because as long as this Marvel Cinematic Universe continues to surprise its fans and become one of the longest-running franchises in film history, I can't see myself ever losing interest. The hype surrounding this film is massive and arguably the largest ever, due to the sheer notion that people have been watching this series for the last ten years.

Nobody could've expected them to make it this far and be this grand, but have they ever done it with this one. Avengers: Infinity War marks the 19th film in this franchise and easily has the most storylines happening at the same time, but if I said I didn't have an absolute blast watching this movie, then I would be lying. From an emotional end to some very funny and exciting action sequences, here's why I loved my experience of this film.

This is the type of movie that will be ruined for those who choose to know more about the core premise than they are given at first. Honestly, every ten minutes brings a surprise that leads into the next scene, so it's very difficult to discuss this movie in depth. That being said, Thanks has finally arrived and plans on wiping out half of humanity in order to bring balance to the universe. Pretty much at random, he will select the half that he wishes to live or die. To do this, his mission is to track down six infinity stones that will allow him to accomplish this with the snap f his fingers. Any other information would ruin this experience for you, so I'll leave it at that.

As far as the characters go, that's probably consecutively the biggest positive and negative that this film has to offer. Yes, seeing everyone is amazing and some of the interactions were the most welcomed portions of the film, but there are times when the movie does seem a little overly ambitious in including everyone that it possibly can. There are a few members left out of the movie, and I personally feel they did that in order to leave room to breathe during this installment. With that said, I personally just enjoyed seeing everyone and didn't let the overload of characters bother me.

Throughout the years, whether it was starting fresh with a movie like Guardians of the Galaxy or jumping into Iron Man 3 without having seen the rest of the movies, newcomers could've easily figured out the missing pieces. Avengers: Infinity War doesn't quite game that same effect, solely due to the fact that there are callbacks and blatant references to films at the very beginning of the franchise. So yes, my recommendation would be to see every movie in the series in order to be fully connected to the events of this movie. For fans of this universe, I don't believe they could've received a more satisfying climax.

From Robert Downey Jr. to Tom Holland, Elizabeth Olsen to Benedict Cumberbatch, the spectrum of performances is on another level here. Everyone is devoted to these characters, but the true standout is easily the performance of Josh Brolin as Thanos. I have a feeling that everyone will be talking about him as the most fleshed out villain this franchise will ever see. His backstory and motivation definitely bring a needed layer to this movie and everyone else gets their time to shine as well. This is a crowd-pleasing movie that also takes risks that I don't think people will be expecting.

In the end, Avengers: Infinity War is one of the most satisfying theatrical experiences I've had in quite some time. From the running time being the longest one yet and feeling pretty fast, to the climax of the movie leaving me quite emotional, to wondering about where they could possibly go next, to the sheer notion of seeing this many characters on-screen at the same time and it not feeling too bloated, I loved my entire experience of this film. Aside from it feeling a little overstuffed at times, Joe and Anthony Russo have crafted yet another fantastic entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It was also a joy to hear the score from The Avengers making a comeback as well. For fans of the franchise, I can't recommend this movie enough. For newcomers, make sure you've at least seen most of the movies. This is a wonderful blockbuster.",9

4DX Seat To Infinity!,3 May 2018,"Sometimes in this life there are things beyond criticism, the Mona Liza for example or Turners rain steam and speed or Chaplin in The Kid. Masterpieces all, no debate right? Then there are products is one soap powder really better than this other, or a $1000 perfume can it really be better say than one at a mere $10, beauty they say is in the eye of the beholder! So they say. Then there is this new mega movie Avengers Infinity War, now i would take issue with anyone that this is actually a movie at all, it is a consumer product the must see/ have accessory for the moment, Pre-sold, Pre-packaged to a ready made audience desperate to spend their money, it is just another fashionable element in today's throw away age. Telephones i believe are sold this way, at least this is how i see the commercial world of now. Now, i know my views are in total opposition to the frankly ridiculous high score's on this web site, and please don't think i am not grateful, my local multiplex needs big profit films to survive and hopefully prosper so the likes of me can see proper films that are real cinematic experiences but make next to no money, usually that's the fate of most superior films these day's! Can i be positive in any way about this Marvel, well i saw it in 4DX & 3D, the chair swam and jolted, there were lights, flashes, and sprays or did i imagine the last one, oh yes, the sound was loud, very very loud. and Oh yes do not forget, it is extremely long, very very long, like a bad flight across the Atlantic but without the benefits of a helpful service attendant's tray. Did i enjoy it? in any way, well no, just too much of a good thing, i like sugar in my tea, but 32 spoons is to much! This i will call it for ease, a film, it just had too much of everything. Now, i can just imagine steam boiling over from most readers that i am clearly to old and out of touch, but i argue not so, the trailer for Deadpool 2 was so funny and inventive that i am eagerly awaiting this release. As for all these many many super hero's to numerous to remember and to numerous to mention, i do have a question for superhero's obviously adoring public the question is, are the comic books any better?",3
The superheroes' movie that will make history.,26 April 2018,"There is a dilemma of not being able to say much after you watch this movie when you follow the directors' request of keeping the hype free of spoilers. Also, I would hate to spoil it for fans as much as I might have killed who do it to me. It also happens that I cannot contain my reaction so here what you should know. So this is a review about nothing. First, let me tell you the other possible tag lines that describe this movie the best: 1. The Greatest Superheroes' movie of All time. 2. NO MATTER HOW MUCH YOU THINK YOU'RE PREPARED, WELL, YOU ARE NOT AND YOU CAN NEVER BE. Second, let's talk about the movie itself. Avengers might be in the title but you will certainly feel it's like the ones before. It is like four whole movies merged into a big one. First you will visit the worlds you know, and then those worlds will come together and get divided into whole new worlds, which will again get together in the most unexpected way. You will find yourself switch from one world to another the way you switch channels, feeling confused before you remember this is infinity War and that it's supposed to happen. It's not the way this movie summed up a whole universe of 18 movies before it that it's considered genius, it's how you find yourself get transitioned from one world to another, how to get from one point to a very far way one so simply and naturally only to leave you not feeling anything but stunned. Third, what to expect? Well, there is actually no point cause no matter how you watched and rewatched every single work marvel had produced, you will still be left thunderstruck. You will laugh, cry, sometimes both at the same time. You will be hit by surprise that you find nothing to do except to stare at the screen with wide eyes and a jaw dropped to the floor. You will be scared, shocked and lot of the times will catch yourself sitting on the edge of your seat, literally, raising your hand to your mouth in the most unexpected moments. The most important thing though that all of this will be in a good way. Request: Please go watch it. Whether you are a Marvel fan or not , whether you are a superheroes' movies fan or not. You might regret that you didn't experience it in the time when it's still fresh and no one had spoiled it for you, but what's even more important, is that you will find whatever you wish for in it. If not, watch it to witness an example of how passion and dedication take works of art to excellence.",10
Maddd,4 May 2018,Don't have the words to describe how amazing this movie is. Great job marvel. It's just what I was waiting for for 10 years.,10
Speechless,23 June 2018,Honestly what can I say? Marvel continues to nail each and every movie one after another leaving us fans speechless. This movie is Marvel at its bloody best! The most interesting thing about this movie is that everyone has a balanced role unlike some movies where one superhero dominates while the others have a blink & miss role. All the characters manage to make themselves visible and noticed and the movie was very well organized! Hats off to the director duo.,10
One of the Best Marvel Movies,28 April 2018,"Went in seeing the high ratings, but didn't put too much credence in that because Black Panther got 9+ reviews and I thought it was mediocre at best.

I want to keep this review simple so that people who have not seen the film will not get any spoilers.

This film is not perfect, but it did a very nice job of blending so many characters and giving each one a moment in the lead. Plus the script was pretty good, with some laugh out loud moments.

Thanos is by far one of the best villains in the MCU. He expresses himself well, you get to know his history and actually shows some feelings. Not many films do that very well.

Bottom line - if you liked the first Ironman, the first Guardians, Avengers, and Thor: Ragnarok, then you will like this film. I would recommend that you need to have seen many of the previous MCU films to get a good sense of the interactions between the characters.

This is the pure definition of a great popcorn movie. Not an Oscar winning film for acting, but it is immensely entertaining.",9
WOW.,29 April 2018,"Absolutely amazing. From start to finish action packed, never a dull moment, truly amazing achievement from everyone who worked on this.",10
A Masterpiece... Marvel's Own Empire Strikes Back!,29 April 2018,"Wow... paying off ten years of excellence was mostly worthwhile and genuinely shocking. This movie assumes you are a fan and know these characters. It jumps right in to the action with no set up or exposition. You are IN this movie right from the start.

The development and ground work from the other 18 films pave the way for a truly emotional drama and mind-blowing experience. And that's just what this movie is... an experience. It's a thrill ride start to finish including genuine ""white knuckle"" fear for some favorite characters. A valid complaint would have to be that this is without a doubt a part 1. It's an incomplete adventure. Yet, having to sit an entire year contemplating what we saw and what's going to happen now only adds to the fun. The after credits scenes is probably the best of any Marvel film. Also, some characters really do get very little screen time. Surprised at how little Cap, Hulk and Black Panther had to do.

Overall, Infinity War is every bit as epic as advertised and a year can't fly by fast enough.",
Great Movie,27 April 2018,"The movie was great and they manage to give screen time to almost all the characters, eventhough it is not an easy task. However, I don't understand why marvel use such crappy background music? Infinity war has horrible background score as if you are watching an 80s sci fi movie!",7
Great movie,30 April 2018,"The best Series avengers all of time, i'm very enjoyed at i wacht it.",10
"FX galore, plastic script",30 April 2018,"This movie has thousands of visual effects shots - and except for a few tiny moments, they are all designed, rendered and composited very professionally. You can't get much better.

But now for the bad part - I always had reservations that Disney corp. Would make superhero films neutered of real menace, too franchise-ey and too polished/bland and that, in effect, is what's wrong with the film.

The script is frequently tone-deaf, as in totally unrelated to the onscreen action or dramatic conflict, which was an issue with previous entries, and the overstuffed ""Civil War"" (this film's ending is ripped from Birth of a Nation, but so are hundreds of titles in the action/adventure/fantasy genre).

Basically, the best parts of the film are supposed to be balls-out breathless action sequences between the Marvel heroes cast and Thanos, a demon-like intergalactic warrior, except Disney, in all it's marketing ""wisdom"", rob ALL the action scenes of drama with inappropriate, flat ""quips"" to carefully telegraph to parents that this is just a 'fun movie' with nothing more at stake than a bit of fun and some wiz-bang VFX. That, in a nutshell, is what's wrong with the film - in an attempt to please an audience who are increasingly exhausted from forty-five previous sequels in the tights-and-CGI genre, they put EVERYTHING into the movie from the Marvel comics canon, but then rob the movie of any real charm or menace with an awful script. Isolated scenes throughout play really well, but whenever the movie's supposed to hit overdrive and turn into a real ""ride"", the dialogue is annoyingly lame. I rate the film at a ""six"" instead of a ""three"" because of the artful VFX, backdrops, sci-fi props and digital camera moves.

Oh - I forgot to mention; the bad guys plan is super-lame also! Great animation, great costume, great backdrop. Lame dramatic goal, therefore the entire film is tainted with an undying lameness that you can't quite shake off, no matter how much key scenes impress. Worth pirating, if you can push a few buttons and it's raining outside . . .",6
Save your time and your money; it's a real downer,21 May 2018,"I wish I could have my 2.5 hours back. The film was over-long and packed with way too much violence for what it delivered as entertainment. It also spent too much time focusing on the villain and his rationalizations for genocide. I found myself wondering if such indulgences would seem inappropriate to dwell on for a real mass murderer like Rudolf Hoess, why is it appropriate dramatically for Thanos? Answer: It's not.

This film was easily the worst Marvel film I've seen.",1
AVENGERS INFINITY WAR HAS LOTS OF FUN,30 April 2018,"Seeing Infinity War was one of the most interesting and most enjoyable experiences a person can have true they probably might have pulled a RWBY(a Rooster Teeth show which I do recommend) after ten years of marvel movies this pulls all increases into a big bowl of fun .after seeing this movie there were kids and probably adults crying a little bit.but I know that this is a part 1 of 2 so I felt hope that all heroes will come back in the sequel. And no I'm just a comic book reader/video gamer who likes action and for those people, who Don't get the story see all the Marvel movies to understand the plot.",10
Unreal,13 June 2018,"Best marvel movie of all marvel movies. This movie does not disappoint. I had really high expectations going in and when I left the theater, this movie blew way past my expectations. Absolutely amazing how they pieced everything together. A little bit of suspense, comedy, drama. Overall this is just an amazing movie. When I said the best marvel movie, it is literally the best marvel movie out there even if you included the fox family. I gave it a 10 because it was very well deserved. I really wished the mutants played roles on this movie just like the comics but unfortunately fox is in the way. Even though the lack of mutants divided the MCU I still feel obligated to give it a 10 because it most certainly deserved it. great job to all who worked on this movie. This is probably not part of the review but I saw a very old couple watching this movie, like I mean 80 years old old and this just shows how marvel comics and the characters created transcends generations after generations which is great because it brings everyone together.",10

The beginning of the end,7 August 2018,,9
"Great as a sequel, but can't stand alone",31 May 2018,"SPOILER: These is many things what can be said about this movie, and most of them are good, so why not talk about obvious stuff everybody keep forgetting. 1) This movie demands you to see all previous marvel movies since 2008. If you missed at least one of them, then you will enjoy this movies quite less. This movie only spends time on developing only one single character (the bad guy), because all previous characters were developed on previous movies. 2) ""Fans"" kept demanding quality villains and actual reasons behind their motivation. The last villain these ""fans"" were satisfied with was Loki back from 2012. So, Marvel just done that - they worked on creating a villain with actual personality, story and motivations. Yet, these same ""fans"" are now complaining about Marvel doing what they demanded Marvel to do. 3) Marvel is subscribing to left wing (cancer) ideologies of diversity (code for anti-white anti-male bigotry) and progressive stacking of victimhood (the biggest ""victim"" is always right). For this reason alone you can bet your life on the fact that Marvel will never ever kill off female or black super hero in one of their movies. Even if one of these character ""dies"", then it will be brought back to life in the next movie. 4) Ending of this movie (it being the first part of two parts) left a opening for the next avenger movie which will follow events directly after this one. However, keeping in mind points 2 and 3 in mind, the next movie most likely will be extremely predictable (lets face, this one was extremely predictable as well).

Overall, i have seen all previous Marvel movies, so i enjoyed this one as well (even after the dumpster fire of Black Panther). But i only enjoyed this one because i have seen all previous movies. If you have seen all previous movies and you also wanted actually quality villain, then you most likely enjoy this movie as well.",6
A movie is supposed to be ...,11 July 2018,"I think a movie is suppose to give you ideas, make you think, pay a better attention on what's going on around you and show some of precious things in life that we miss on these days, not just a movie about comics with zero quality of being a movie ! Despite the war and all those useless speeches in the movie what else has the movie told you ? The mindset of people nowadays is going crazy and mad, this movie does not worth that rating and I don't know why I wasted my time on this useless movie .",1
The Vidiot Reviews....,13 August 2018,"Avengers: Infinity War

When uniting a team of 1960s superheroes in 2018 it's important to first weed out all of the racist characters.

Fortunately, the antagonist in the epic sci-fi/fantasy happens to be purple and powerful.

In his endless pursuit to amass all infinity stones and bring balance to the universe, omnipotent extraterrestrial Thanos (Josh Brolin) invades earth to obtain to the final gem.

Standing in his way, however, are not only the Avengers (Robert Downey Jr., Scarlett Johansson, Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth) but also their intergalactic counterparts Guardians of the Galaxy (Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Bradley Cooper).

Striking a perfect balance between action and emotion, this third entry in the franchise is the culmination of Marvel Studios first decade of filmmaking and it offers up a myriad of shocks and surprises, including an earthshattering ending.

Incidentally, now that his bejeweled gauntlet is complete, Thanos is going to be hawking shoddy replicas on QVC. Green Light

MUST SEE!,19 July 2018,"I love it. Everything in the movie, except for a visual effect shot with Bruce Banner in the Hulkbuster suit near Avengers: Infinity War's ending, is perfect. The stakes are higher and, for me, Thanos is the MCU's best and most compelling villain than Killmonger and Hela.",10
Only one word describes this movie - WOW !!!,21 August 2018,"I don't even know where to begin to describe how much I enjoyed this film.

Let's start by saying that if you read reviews, please do not take the criticisms that say this film is without a plot, and those who did not understand what was going on in the film. Because it's really not true.

The film makes you feel so many things: from pain, laughter, sadness, a little more laughter and more sadness. Of all the movies of Marvel it is definitely the best one. And to see the variety of characters in the film - absolutely amazing. Pure pleasure.

The film leaves us with a lot of questions, especially about Marvel's future.

This film is highly recommended for viewing with the whole family, and only with those who know the stories of Marvel - That they will not tell you later: ""I did not understand"" or ""There is no plot here"" And I very much hope that you will enjoy and be filled with emotions like me.",10
Marvel does it again... much better than DC...,19 May 2018,"The difference between Marvel and DC seems to be the lighthearted, tongue-in-cheek, clever and entertaining writing, directing and acting that Marvel has vs the dark, gloomy, pretentious plots, writing, directing and acting of the latest DC movies. I love the Marvel characters (intelligent, quick and witty) and how the movies seamlessly weave the characters/stories together to come to this huge climatic ""war"", with a cliffhanger ending that makes us eager for more. Can't wait for the next one. (Admittedly, I reviewed the wrong movie here first and it wouldn't let me delete my review, only edit it, so this is short and sweet.) Clever, exciting addition to the Marvel saga In My Humble Opinion!",8
"Wow, 2 1/2 hours of fun.",6 May 2018,"SPOILER: Saw it Friday night with my son.

Gotta say, never a dull moment in this one and I never felt overwhelmed which surprised me with about a thousand cast members in this one.

Great job introducing the bad guy as a real imposing fella. Then an interesting kind of twist making him seem not so bad as they revealed his story.

Some seriously funny lines in this one. Had me laughing out loud at the theater.

My son says he wants to buy it.

It will be interesting to see where they go from here. Can't wait for part II.

We (and EVERYONE at the theater) stayed throughout the credits to get our Marvel tidbit. Not worth the LONG wait...

Really enjoyed this one. All characters seemed to have a significant role. Even Groot got a shining moment.

A couple surprisingly moving moments among all the whizzbang stuff.

D.C. really has an uphill battle now.

I still don't know who that gal with the power to destroy an infinity stone is.

But Spiderman can't remember names either :D

I really don't like Zoe as Garmora; the only chink in the Marvel armor here IMO. But I still give it a 10. I don't know what more you could have asked for.

Well done.",10

Avengers infinity war,7 November 2020,There are too many characters in the film and it confuses the audience The dependence of the film on the next part is another weakness.,6
Avengers: Infinity War,27 April 2018,"Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadger

After 10 years of character and plot building, we finally get what we have been waiting for. Infinity War is a film of epic proportion that makes first Avengers film look like a small feat. Infinity War has a complex story filled with exquisite fight sequences, humor, and amazing characters. The biggest hurdle for this film was fitting in a lot of characters in only two and a half hours. Anthony and Joe Russo successfully give all the characters a fair amount of screen time and introduces use to the amazingly effective Thanos. The story is filled with emotional moments and has some power when it comes to the reality of Thanos' power.

The acting is very good. Robert Downey Jr., Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Don Cheadle, Benedict Cumberbatch, Tom Holland, Zoe Saldana, Chadwick Boseman, Karen Gillan, Tom Hiddleston, Paul Bettany, Elizabeth Olsen, Anthony Mackie, Sebastian Stan, Chris Pratt, and many others perform very well. Josh Brolin performs the best in my eyes. He plays Thanos who is extremely complex and is the second-best superhero villain I have ever witnessed behind The Joker. Thanos truly is the best part of the film in my eyes.

The pacing is perfect. Infinity War throws us into the action immediately and doesn't let up. The runtime is also perfect.

There are a couple of things I didn't like in the film. Peter Dinklage's character looked rather foolish. His accent and the way his character looked made him seem fake. I also didn't like the Wakanda scenes. Their accents are extremely annoying, in my eyes, and some the characters in Wakanda are kinda cringy.

All in all, Avengers: Infinity War is a masterclass superhero film. It is the second-best superhero film ever made right behind Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight. I truly loved it and I am really excited for part two.

Pros: Intense, emotional, and heartbreaking story, good humor, amazing characters, very good acting, Josh Brolin as Thanos, Thanos being one of the greatest movie villains ever, great pacing, a good runtime, and how Thanos is a really effective villain throughout the entire film

Cons: Peter Dinklage's character is and looks bad and most of the Wakanda scenes and characters are kinda cringy

Overall Rating: 9.5

P.S. I would recommend watching all the MCU's movies before watching this film. If you don't want to watch them all just watch these: Iron Man, Thor, Captain America: The First Avenger, The Avengers, Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Thor: The Dark World, Guardians of the Galaxy, Avengers: Age of Ultron, Captain America: Civil War, Doctor Strange, and Thor: Ragnarok. This list leaves out seven Marvel films that should be watched but could be skipped. Enjoy!",9
The end but probably not the end,4 August 2018,"This is a big movie, a really big movie. Pretty much every Marvel character in the universe pulled in to a giant, drawn out fight for the fate of the universe. The production values are of course excellent but somehow I just felt it was a bit overwhelming, another fight, another explosion, another Marvel character, by the time it finally finished I was a bit beyond caring. It would have made a clever final chapter for the avengers but suprise, suprise I see there is another Avengers movie coming next year so I guess it is really just another super-hero movie.",6
Who rate this 9?,1 May 2018,"This was an awful movie! pretentious and trying too hard.. no plot, no story developement.. mediocre acting performances!!!

One of the leading actresses used to work for website videforex.tk as a model and account manager, how can she end up in a A-list movie?

The first avengers was quite original. But this one!!! I was excpecting it to be way better. I spent more time thinking about how cold the theater was than being interested in the things blowing up in the movie LOL.

Seems Hollywood is now a CGI puppet for making superheros movies that shouldn't be made in the first place. If they keep making movies like this one people will start watching the 50' titles again.

Just my cents.",1

Just Amazing!,4 August 2018,"I dont have words for describe it, the best super hero movie of the all the times! Just it ^^",10
Amazing but with some inaccuracies,21 October 2020,"This is a very good movie but it has some incongruity, with some things that leaves you with a bad taste.",8
the crew at Marvel prove that it was worth the wait,21 May 2018,"The world is on fire...the stakes have never been higher...it all comes down to this; ten years in the making, the stage has been set for Marvel's gritty, somber, epic-scale collaboration, as a powerful intergalactic despot sets his sights on collecting all six Infinity Stones in order to ""fulfill his destiny"" and rebalance the universe as he sees fit. Old grudges will have to be put aside, egos will have to be kept in check, and unlikely alliances will have to be formed as all of the world's heroes (Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, Star Lord, Doctor Strange, Black Panther, et al) must band together to take on an adversary unlike any they've ever encountered before. This intense, sprawling, multi-character saga has the requisite amount of witty humor and relentless, edge of your seat action, but pushes far beyond the boundaries of the comic book world and emerges as an ambitious, allegorical, and often heartbreaking spectacle of heroism and sacrifice that will resonate with viewers long after the film is over. Goes on for a long time, but seeing ten years' worth of MCU characters united for a colossal front is more than enough to compensate. Brolin makes Thanos a compelling, multilayered, and somewhat tragic villain who is sure to be remembered for years to come; a solid outing for non-fans, and a sure-fire hit for dedicated followers. ***½",
I don't get it! sorry.,10 October 2018,"This movie was an experience full of adrenaline rush! for the sake of all the great fights, all our heroes stuck under the same roof. However even if it was fun and pretty much enjoyable I didn't really get into it and the problem here is the fact I am not that into the Marvel universe and this movie felt like a sequel to every standalone Marvel film that came out last year so I felt like I was missing on something, and couldn't fully connect to the story it was like starting to harry potters saga with the 4th movie, you'll enjoy the action but you won't feel passion and compassion to the characters. and this is the case with every Marvel movie I've seen so far.",6
Crying all the way!,27 April 2018,"I'll try not to spoil anything, but let me say that this is by far the best marvel film, if not just the best film, I have ever seen!

The story was great, the acting was great. You could see everyone's emotions just by looking into their eyes.

I will say, you need to be prepared for some extremely emotional sections, especially the ending.

I'll also say that there is only ONE post credit scene. It comes after the long credits, so be sure to wait through the whole thing!

This was an AMAZING film. Go see it now!",10
half a great movie,27 April 2018,"Avengers started off REALLY great, gets a LITTLE long in the tooth after an hour and a half and wraps up with a HEAVY but at the same time rather anti-climactic ending that feels incomplete as a movie... pretty good but not GREAT. First hour was dynamite though.",7
10 years of insipid,6 May 2018,"Keep in mind that just because s movie makes billions, that does not make it a good movie. Like most of Marvel movies this is an insipid mess. The entire plot took 10 years to develop and is summed up in this latest entry in 4 or 5 sentences. Acting isn't necessary or required, just grimace and look sweaty and vacant. Meanwhile we'll fill the screen with 50,000 CGI lights and explosions and convince you what is happening matters. Well it doesn't.",1

Just see and enjoy this movie !!,5 August 2018,,9
Epic.,24 May 2018,"I don't know how a superhero sci-fi action film can be any more entertaining than this. It was such a well-paced, well-scripted film which was filled to the brim with excitement and had just a dash of humor. The story never once seemed too big for the directors to convey or the characters to portray considering the end of the universe was at stake. Credit the Russo brothers for their vision and the cast for an incredible delivery. Marvel set the bar so extremely high here that its hard to expect anything more than disappointment when Part 2 rolls out in 2019. Maybe I'm wrong. Hopefully I'm wrong. Because I sure can't wait to conclude this epic tale of triumph and destruction come next year. Once again Marvel, your hold on the cinematic universe has just become stronger than Thanos's grip inside the Infinity Gauntlet.",10
People miss the point,25 April 2018,"The movie is actually 9/10+ Shawshank redemption and godfather/dark knight all of which are amazing movies due to the plot and storyline progression. Infinity War has so much more than that,AMAZING CGI,GREAT story/character progression,fast paced sequences,epic dialogue,funny moments,incredibly believeable fight sequences,the camera angles/quality everything is written and executed perfectly,this film is actually reached its potential and so much more. The movie could not have been done better and thats why it deserves a solid 8.7/9.2 IMO.",10
Sets a new standard,29 April 2018,"Again Marvel has done it again. There's no denying it, it's a must watch. Better and bigger than the first two Avengers. Can't wait for the 4th installment.",10
"Too many storylines, slightly unrealistic even for Marvel, Thanos is weak, 4DX was amazing",28 April 2018,,
It doesn't make sence: see reason below,4 August 2018,,6
Purple enemy is enemy number one,20 July 2022,"""Losing is always bitter... Consider yourself right and lose..."". These words always come to mind when it comes to ""Avengers 3"" or Thanos. Powerful, painfully truthful and devastating.

Infinity War wasn't just an expected movie. He was mega-expected. The whole history of the Infinity Stones, all the storylines led to this final point of action. The intensity of expectation has reached unprecedented peaks. Therefore, the film had to be two or even three heads higher than its predecessors, so that the viewer was really stunned. And it was quite possible for the creators.

What did you remember about the film? Yes to everyone. There are so many emotions at once, but you need to put them on the shelves. The obvious thing that probably delighted me and everyone was the masterfully staged development of the plot. Almost all the characters from past films are here. So much was not even in the ""Citizen"". A couple dozen, if not more. And that's cool. The directors perfectly show each character, their experiences and difficult decisions, dedication and striving for their goal. Of course, when watching the viewer looks back at the previous films, he already has an opinion about each character. Therefore, in ""War"" all the attention is on the action, which, by the way, is insanely much.

The film starts, immediately setting up a serious and uncompromising mood. The first scenes are gloomy, the music presses, and the henchman of the villain literally sentences with his monologue. And it was strong. Let the film then change its tone from gloomy to cheerful and back several times, still the general mood remains not at all comical.

The main antagonist is remembered. Thanos, in my opinion, stands above all the villains who were in the film universe. He is diverse, his thoughts, clothed in words, are well understood. Sometimes it doesn't leave the feeling that his plan is a bit childish, and the decision to deal with everyone is a bit silly, especially with artifacts such as Infinity Stones, but in his reality this is the best decision, he came to it, and he defends it.

The film is gorgeous in its visual component. In 2.5 hours, the viewer gets just a lot of impressions, sees the maximum possibilities of the cinematic universe, every frame, every scene is full of events and a magnificent visual component. The pictures are diverse. There are cities on Earth, and Wakanda, and Titan, and space. And everything has its own unique colors and shades. There is also sound and music. Oppressive, and somewhere victorious, brutal or sentencing - all the sounds absolutely organically fit into the concept of the film.

And of course the finale was simply stunning. I remember how the whole hall fell silent, observing the metamorphoses that were unclear at that time.

The movie came out great. Marvel has shown its true trump cards, including emotional clashes, unpredictable deaths in the best traditions of the ""Game of Thrones"", and the viewer suddenly realizes that it turns out that even here the heroes do not have absolute invulnerability, and they are mortal. And that's right. Let the stereotypes be broken.

""Infinity War"" demonstrated an excellent result, rose above all previous works within the film universe, broke off suddenly, forcing the audience to guess for another year what would happen next and thereby making the interest in the next picture even greater.

10 out of 10.",10

I can't think of another series of movies with such an assortment of complex characters that has done this so flawlessly. George Lucas could learn a thing or two from Marvel.

10/10 and echoing the comments of another review ""The Best Super Hero Movie Ever Made!"" Perhaps the best Action/Sci-Fi movie ever made at that...

It's annoying how people can be blinded from plot holes, cheap character deaths and frankly some cheesy acting for the most part just because of the hype.

Masterpiece,28 April 2018,Flawless film hands down!!! 10/10 rating doesn't do Avengers Infinity War justice. It is BY FAR the best of the MCU films. Just from an acting perspective alone it's one of the best films ever! I will probably see this at least 2 more times before it leaves the theater ... in IMAX and in 3D.,10
Masterpiece,30 April 2018,"Went to see this in 3D IMAX, unfortunately we had some kids behind us that would not shut up and kept kicking our chairs.

Depsite this, we still thought the movie was amazing, but had a nagging feeling we had missed parts somehow.

So, we went back the next day, this time in regular movie theater (though the biggest screen in the area).

Firstly, have to say, 3D IMAX gave nothing to this movie, or any other movie i have seen in 3D IMAX for a while now. Done with 3D.

Secondly, after watching it a second time, i believe this is a masterpiece of cinematic entertainment.

How everything comes together, how the characters are injected into the storyline at perfect moments of introduction, interactions and fight scenes, even the Thanos character development. All just brilliant.

The crowd, was like being at a highly competitive soccer match, everyone screaming and applauding.

EDIT: coming back after watching Endgame, comparing the two movies. Whilst Endgame is a fantastic movie on its own, it definately has its problems. Comparatively, Infinity War wins supreme across not just Marvel, but all super hero movies.",10

Incredible Movie That Will Beat Your Expectations!,29 April 2018,"Avengers: Infinity War does an incredible job of melding together many storylines and characters into a beautifully intertwined story that's not even hard to follow. It does everything previous MCU movies have done, but on a much grander scale. The villain Thanos is especially compelling and has really done justice to all the times he's been hinted at since Avengers Assemble. This movie has it all - sci-fi, drama, fantasy, comedy, and action, so I'm sure all audiences will like something about it. The acting was pretty good across the board but since everyone had limited screen time (even in such a long movie!), what really stood out to me was the amazing visuals, and of course, the very long story arch finally coming near an end. The ending is also exceptional, but I won't speak much about that. Overall, I can't wait for the next ensemble movie and can't recommend this one enough.",10

Excellent version!,16 August 2020,"I read the original Infinity Gauntlet series many years ago, and while the storyline isn't exactly the same, they did an incredible job bringing it to the big screen!

The action and portrayal of the superheroes was very well done and I was excited to see Thanos in the ending credits of so many of the Marvel movies. I knew what was coming. However, I was disappointed that Death wasn't Thanos' love interest, it still came off as exciting and fun to watch. Head and shoulders above Endgame for sure!",9
Good popcorn film,26 April 2018,"This was a good movie. Marvel and Disney did a good one here. The comeback from boringly predictable flicks with forced jokes of phase 3 (I am looking at you Ragnarok) is good. It still had more jokes that I would like in a movie that is about destroying half the universe but then again you cannot have a Disney movie without jokes. Every character is sometimes comedic relief. As a standard Marvel/Disney movie. But it's not too overdone.

Now for the story, don't forget it's Part 1. I will not spoil the story for anyone here. Now do not go in this one expecting Godfather or (as a superhero movie) Dark Knight or any top 20 IMDB movies quality acting and story (although probably the fan boys will send this one up there). But it is one of the best MCU movies to date (not the best super hero movie or the best Marvel superhero movie, but specifically to MCU)",7
Did not like this.,4 May 2018,"This film was literally 2 and a half hours of non stop roller coaster action. This may sound like the perfect movie. But just think of this for a moment.

The film was literally;

Villian comes on the scene, whichever avengers is around flies or runs at them. Gets bounced back. Flies again, gets bounced back, flies again gets bounced back, flies again gets bounced back.

Then an escape happens, as the villian always gets what he come for as even his minions are way too powerful for every single avenger in the film. Cue literally 2mins of wisecracking and jokes. Next scene cuts eslewhere, villian comes on the scene, avenger flies or runs at them, gets bounced back, then 2 more mins of wisecracking and jokes..... for 2 and a half hours.

The diaglogue is minimal in the extreme. Possibly only 200 or so words get said in total throughout the whole 2 and a half hour movie. Almost all of it is just filler wisecracking jokes.

Watching this movie honestly felt like watching someone else play a video game, with the 2min cut scenes kept in.

I don't know if I am getting old, or if it was just this film but I did not enjoy this. I loved black panther that I seen a month ago. But also hated Justice Leage so am not sure. I get the feeling kids will love this and think it the most epic thing they have ever seen. But parents will be bored. A movie needs to be more than just this.",5
The best movie,24 March 2022,Avengers infinity war is a best action and emotional movie .we can see many characters in it but the movie is well balanced and the movie is super awesome .I will call it a masterpiece .action sequences were top notch well balanced .best Marvel movie 🎥🍿 .that's what I can say.,10
That feeling when you can't stop thinking about what you've just experienced.,29 April 2018,"Seen it twice in a weekend. To say it's a game changer would be an understatement. Perfectly crafted, perfectly directed, perfect interactions (Thor and the Guardians were just made for each other) and the perfect Thanos.

Have you ever had that emotion which has a ton of this and loads of that, with little amounts of this and a pinch of that and overall it's something you can't describe? Exhilaration, perfect and pure joy, heartbreaking sadness and anger with an overarching excitement that's more than you've ever felt before. That's what I felt in more than a word.

It's an unparalleled achievement that more than surpasses its hype. It's more than you want and it leaves you wanting more. It's not the best Marvel movie because it can't be compared to the rest of them. It's more than that. It's an experience. You need to see it!",10

"Good action, but...",8 June 2018,"Marvel never fails at creating action-packed films. I was never bored throughout the movie. I am a sucker for good superhero action, so I found this very enjoyable. However, this is only nice if you don't over think it. Once you start analyzing the film and each individual character, things get confusing. You can see for yourself, but as a fan of many Marvel superheroes, I was kind of disappointed at how some of them were portrayed (you'll see what I mean). I feel like Marvel made this film plot only regarding the end goal, hence they manipulated and portrayed many characters oddly (and incorrectly) just to reach that end goal. This whole film felt like the set up for the sequel. The film had an overly simple plot and seemed set up just to give background for the upcoming sequel. MY RECOMMENDATION is to wait until the sequel is out, and then watch the two movies successively. I think that would be the most satisfying. Nonetheless, I enjoyed the action. Viewing this film without overanalysing it would leave you pretty satisfied.",6
Intergalactic Masterpiece,29 April 2018,"The movie was fantastic, within the first 5 minutes the audience knew they were in for the long haul, it was spectacular. Usually, we expect credits that are comical but this one we just get a black screen with white credits. It was simply amazing from the fight scenes which were pretty much the whole time, but it also showed the dynamic ranges of the characters.",10
"Works if you just try and enjoy it as one long visual spectacle, without looking at anything else",6 May 2018,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning

The mighty, evil Thanos (Josh Brolin) is in need of one more 'infinity stone' to place on his giant glove in order to control the universe. In New York, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is approached by Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) and his ally Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) in order that they reunite to battle him, and gets treated to a big demonstration of his powers in a massive city battle, during which young buck Peter Parker (Tom Holland) makes his presence known as his Spider-Man alter ego. As the old gang reunite, they cross paths with Skylord (Chris Pratt) and his gang...

After an endless stream of singular Marvel universe entries where individual characters have faced their battles and revealed their back stories, directors The Russo Brothers have here decided the next logical step is to create a big, all out spectacle of a film, where the stand alone characters meet up with the Guardians of the Galaxy characters, and combine their powers to take down an epic super villain. It's no doubt something the die hard fans of the series will have been looking forward to, and will have been on the cards for a while given the huge box office takings. But, while it's as big a visual splendour as all the others, in the end it sadly works best only on a superficial level.

The central plot is paper thin, and not nearly strong enough to sustain a movie of its length and scope. Not only that, it's also overly reliant on the viewer having an extensive knowledge of all the previous films, rendering it a benign mystery to anyone who's casually chosen to see it. The original Avengers Assemble film (now unbelievably over five years old!) managed to get all the featured characters to gel together well, but this seems over eager to examine all the characters back story and relationships with others, and all together here, there's too much to take in, in a plot that goes nowhere and drags on for far too long.

Overlong, overblown and over-ambitious, this will end up over-whelming even the most ardent Marvel fan. It just about manages to succeed by being as colourful and visually exciting as all the rest, with dazzling special effects and thrill a minute action sequences. But this, sadly, is pretty much the best it has to offer. ***",7

The most fun of experiences you can have in a cinema.,29 April 2018,,10
Absolutely Amazing!,28 April 2018,,10
THE BEST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN,29 April 2018,Clearly it is the best movie i have ever seen. And please don't wait for the pirated version or see it in a cam version just go into a theater and watch this movie and believe me when i say this you will not be disappointed. Thanos is not like the other 'destroy universe and rule the world' type of a villain we have seen before (excluding Killmonger and Vulture) in the previous marvel movies. We will feel a connection to him and sometimes we may even feel that his motivation to wipe out half the the population of universe to save it not that bad.,10
I genuinely cannot fathom how someone could not love this film.,27 April 2018,"I have to admit, Marvel is just full of geniuses.

So we're in a setting where we have roughly a dozen superheroes so maybe you fear the lack of character development, insufficient movement on the plot, or perhaps you just suspect a very thin plot. Free yourselves from those perceptions and rest assured that Marvel knows what it is doing:

Instead of trying to significantly build on their massive number of heroes, it almost seems to focus more on the villain, Thanos, who I believe gets the most amount of screen time in this movie. I personally found this brilliant because it doesn't over-complicate the story of any one single hero and eliminates some sense of superficiality we would often otherwise get. Each relationship between the protagonists seems believable and too much time isn't spent on a single particular protagonist. Shifting the balance to the development of the antagonist enables a great flow to the movie, both in terms of character and plot development, and it does this so seamlessly.

So prepare yourself for there is humble and perfect amount of comedy; there is action so spectacularly executed that it supersedes my imagination; there's love, loss, and even just a little heartbreak. It's truly one of the greatest roller coaster's I've been in my life.

Don't go into it being overly critical and keep in open mind. Also yes, they will always continue to encourage you to spend more money with this franchise; but, you know what? - I will be more than happy to keep spending it and I think you will be too. :)

Congrats on another fantastic addition to the franchise! (y)",10

Civil War was better,29 April 2018,,6
Better without so much CGI,16 August 2018,,8
"Good film, better than I had expected",26 April 2018,"I enjoyed Avengers: Infinity War much more than I had expected and was impressed that the film was as good as it was considering all the characters Marvel were including from all the other MCU films.

Generally the film is well paced and the story is ok. A lot of what happened in Civil War seems to have been ignored and whilst the story is pretty simple it works ok, though if you think about it for a few minutes the plot holes do start to show but for the most part the film doesn't give you a huge amount of time to dwindle on what happened 5 minutes before, so it isn't a big problem.

The film is quite dark but does have Marvels normal amount of humour, particularly in the first half of the film. The action is handled generally very well and but like most Marvel films, it does become a bit of a CGI fest at times.

The big thing with the film is getting the characterisation right. Thanos is given much more of an character arc than I expected, not just the normal evil villian we have grown used to with most of the MCU films. The other bad guys in the film feel much more throw away though and they don't really hold the threat that they really should.

As for the good guys, it is really very much the norm, with each character conforming to their normal stereo type, not that this is always a bad thing.

The score is pretty forgettable but does a decent job. The effects are very good and the cinematography looks pretty nice.

Overall I gave it a 7 but it is probably work a 7.5. I does everything pretty well and is well worth having a watch, particularly if you are a MCU fan.",7
My thoughts.,13 May 2018,,4
"Personally, my favorite marvel movie yet.",29 April 2018,"There was never a dull moment in this movie. It grabs your attention from the very beginning and leaves you begging for the next movie. It swirls you through every emotion, plenty of sad moments but finally the right amount of comedy in a marvel movie. The only down might be the predictability, yet it was that desired predictability. I don't think this movie could have improved in any way.",10
Outstanding...,21 January 2022,"""Avengers: Infinity War"" is an Action - Sci-Fi movie in which we watch the Avengers trying to defeat the powerful Thanos with the help of their allies. They have to try hard in order to defeat him and they have also to work together to succeed.

Since I had already watched the previous Marvel movies, I have to admit that I was expecting this movie and I had high expectations by it, and I was not disappointed. It had an amazing plot that contained some plot twists that made it very interesting and also plenty of action and suspense. The direction which was made by Anthony Russo and Joe Russo was simply amazing and they succeeded on making the audience follow their characters and be with them through the whole duration of the movie. Regarding the interpretations of the cast each and every one of them was also very good and did their best to have this beautiful result. Finally, I have to say that ""Avengers: Infinity War"" is the ultimate action science fiction movie and I strongly recommend everyone to watch it.",9
Through this movie I became a Marvel fan,28 April 2019,I haven't ever watched any Marvel movies before this.. my friend told me that this movie is awesome so I bought tickets for it.. after watching it I couldn't understand what happened.. then I started watching all the movies chronologically... And today I watched Endgame.. thank you Marvel,10
Incredible,29 April 2018,Just massive and breathtaking and so good. Little tiny knit-picking problems here and there but they just took 18 movies to lead up to one big one and it's as epic as it should be.,10
Everything I wanted,29 April 2018,"One of the best, if not, the best MCU film to date. I wanted to see as much of thanos as possible and get to know this character more and they delivered 10 times over. The visuals and conceptual art in this film is utterly incredible. Weta of course.

This film nailed everything I wanted in this first instalment.",10
MCU's 18 film mash up masterpiece,29 April 2018,Infinity war was all the hype and then some. Must see if you're a comic book fan and mcu fan.,10
It was good but why all the hate?!?!?,19 September 2018,"My problem here is with the people that give bad ratings. I am a bit of a hard-core marvel fan myself and didnt consider this film as great as people claim.

Yes loads and i mean LOADS of stuff could've been better but the movie still came out just as i expected it will. Not that much dialogue, thanos underrated powers, that he will win and many characters were gonna die.

I think this is the first movie in this industry to make an attempt at doing something this big, i think they did an ""OK"" job that will get improved later on. The movie received lots of unnecessary hype from lots of marvel fans that claim its the best comic book movie ever made, only because they got to see some of their favourite characters onscreen together.

Some people claim its really bad because of whats wrong in it which i think they did their best as whay was expected was delivered. Others claim they didnt enjoy thw movie because they didnt get what was going on, that movie is simply not for you, watch the previous ones, read comics do anything just dont go and watch a movie that you have to build yourself up to without doing so and blame that on the movie",7
The Movie of the Year.. Breathtaking and Beautiful...,29 April 2018,"Making things clear this is a no spoler review.. Really don't wanna spoil the movie coz it is definately a movie to be experienced... In 3D or in IMAX if thats available... The movie is a visual treat...

After being pushed to end credit scenes and Cameos the Mad Titan comes in the limelight.... And boy he does not dissapoint.. He is the meanest creature in the Universe.. Hell bent on wiping half the population of the universe he embarks on the mission to collect all 6 infinity stones.. Josh Brolin as the Mad Titan Thanos nails it and even though he is CGI bt the motion capture nails it and bring out the emotions perfectly..

If I start writing individually about all the characters then this review will go for pages and pages coz there are a lot nd by lot i mean hell lotta characters...

So to cut it short.. Everyone played their part nicely and got decent screen time..

The Russo Brothers (Joe and Anthony) deserve special mention because handling so many characters is not easy and other people might have failed miserably. But the Russos nail it. Giving each character ample screen time and push the storyline and character arc of every character forward..

It was the penultimate episode of 10 years of the MCU. And trust me this is not your run of the mill Marvel movie. This movie will evoke emotions in you which you never thought existed... Its a roller-coaster ride and it is worth taking...

So go to a theater near you and catch this brilliant piece of movie which will stay with you evern after you leave the theatre...

A cinema experience like no other.,27 April 2018,"The most amazing thing about this film isn't the acting or the actors or the story line (even though they were all fantastic) it was the balance. The ability to balance that many main characters, the ability to manage the serious and funny moments and the ability to manage the time. All these factors will make this movie an all time great.

This movie deserves to be inside the top 50 films ever (although it won't because superhero movies not named ""The Dark Knight"" don't get the same ""street cred"" rating wise)

This is a beautiful watch, for the best experience see this in iMax 3D.",10

Defied expectations,29 April 2018,,8
A Once In A Lifetime Experience,30 April 2018,"This film may not be an oscar contender or even that good but it was a historical event that will be remembered by generations after generations

So let's get into it

The biggest and most anticipated blockbuster film is finally here and I saw it two days ago on 28th. How well does it hold up?

First I want to give my thoughts on my initial experience. The audience was amazing, they were already familiar with the characters, which really added to the experience as the crowd popped on some pretty applaud worthy moments, which are present in an overwhelming amount in this movie. That being said, this was a roller coaster of emotions too. So many moments that made us laugh, gasp and hold our breathe. We were on the edge of our seats. I mean, this was not a film, this was a SAGA, a big EVENT that I am very proud to witness in my life time. This may be the most fun I've ever had in the theater.

Now that I've gotten my initial thoughts out of the way, let's dissect the movie and go under the surface

This film has sort of a negative which usually wouldn't work for a film that stands on it's own. It doesn't take time to set up or make you care about all the core characters which is a bit problematic for anyone who is seeing this movie and isn't familiar with previous installments. I have been following MCU since the start so thankfully I was fine. But this negative sort of turns into a positive for this movie because the film didn't need to set the characters up. Instead they were able to go one action scene to another, and they were able to go the pay offs a bit more quickly than they otherwise would in a standalone film. However important scene after another can be a bit exhausting and considering the runtime of this movie, some may feel exhausted AFTER watching it because this movie has so much you need to take in and process.

The writing is fine. There are convenient plot devices and plot point you would expect from it and how things go from A and B but don't underestimate this movie because it does have surprises and twists you may not see coming. Some of the characters they focus on have a really good arc, I'm not gonna spoil which characters. But one character I would talk about without spoiling is the antagonist Thanos. Wow, he was done right. I mean, he had a reasonable goal and you could see where he was coming from and why he was doing what he was doing. He was imposing, threatening. You could feel the threat he posed right from early on. He brought a sense of hopelessness that is usually missing from MCU. He is a good addition to the list of good MCU villains such as Killmonger, Zemo and etc.

Character interactions between some of our heroes were really good. All these years we were wondering how certain characters would interact with others and the film does not disappoint. Interactions, whichever ones happened, were so satisfying.

The film also balances humor really well. Yeah there's a little bit of forced humor but most of it is on point. Especially Drax, who is one of the funniest characters of MCU. Comedy scenes with Guardians are awesome as always.

The visuals. This movie is an eye candy lover's wet dream. WOW. Everybody and everything looks great. Especially Thanos. The CGI on him is done very well. Except one member of Black Order, all others look good. The costumes of heroes, especially Spider Man looks AMAZING. This movie will give you one nerd gasm after another because of how good it looks and FEELS.

The performances were really good. All actors got their moment to shine, especially Josh brolin. He was the biggest surprise as Thanos. He did so well. I applaud his performance. I did not expect him to be as good as he was in the role.

The scope and scale of this film is something I really appreciated. Unlike many other MCU films, the stakes felt real and the world felt lived in and real and you could sense the danger and worry about it. You could feel the consequences of actions of characters. This was a very tense film. And very dark too. I did not expect this to be THIS dark, which works really well in this film's favor. This movie BRINGS THE WAR. I mean if you were disappointed that Civil War wasn't extreme enough( i don't think so though, I love Civil War) , Infinity War was BRUTAL and HARD HITTING, you will not be disappointed.

There is a very good and intriguing set up for the future of MCU. I mean this one will leave you salivating for more and wondering what happens next. I mean, Marvel Studios has my money for next movie, I will be there to see it next year. And yes, to all those who leave before post credits, don't! THERE IS ONE IMPORTANT POST CREDIT SCENE YOU HAVE TO SEE.

It's mind blowing what MCU has done here. Especially Russo brothers with this film, this was a difficult job but they nailed it. This is a dream come true for anyone who has been reading comics since they were little and at times when superhero films weren't a thing. I am not one of them, I was a marvel fan when I was little but I didn't read any comics. But I have been following MCU since the start and I'm so grateful because they are still doing a good job of keeping us invested in this universe and showing us why we still give a damn about some of the characters. Certain scenes made me teary eyed with happiness knowing I'm part of the audience who has been following this thing for 10 YEARS! This is something i can't wait to tell my grand kids or kids of later generations :')

Congrats to Marvel Studios, Kevin Feige, and all the directors, writers, producers and people who worked in MCU and made it happen. They have done a brilliant job of creating such a cohesive, consistent and expansive universe. I salute them.

Rating 7.8/10

It came close to an 8 which is what I gave Avengers 1. I highly recommend this movie. especially if you are a fan of MCU but even if you're not, you won't be disappointed. In fact, you will be overwhelmed by how good it is.",7
Best movie ever,29 April 2018,,10
Overstuffed; should've cut out Team Cap,19 May 2018,,6
"Solid Jokes, Solid Heroes, Good Aesthetic, Stupid story and villian",8 May 2018,"I like the stand alone Marvel Movies more, but it almost feels like an obligation to see all of them if you want to see the ones you like, or else, you'll have no idea what's going on when the ones you like continue. I'm prefacing with that so readers understand that I'm not just a hater.

First off, I want to address the villain. My opinions I've heard/read asserted Thanos is a strength to this film. I found that to be the opposite.

I found his motivation more convincing than the Justice League villains, who were so bad, I can't even really remember their motivation, and a bit less stupid than Ultron who was the AI thing that might have seemed like a real issue in the 80s or early 90s. But today it seems clear that the misuse of technology to our demise is going to be gradual rather than sudden.

The vulture from Spider Man Homecoming, or the villain from Black Panther were much more compelling In my Opinion. Thanos felt like a cartoonish version of the villain Samuel Jackson played in the first Kingsmen movie. Except that Thanos didn't work like how the similar villain in Kingsmen worked.

They're both trying to save everything by killing off a sizable chunk of people before people kill their planet or planets. The difference is that Thanos wants to randomly and painlessly kill half of everyone everywhere, and Valentine wants to save a few chosen wealthy friends. Overpopulation and idiocy is a real issue on earth. But in the Marvel Universe, it's a planet to planet issue, and it seems stupid to just kill off half of everyone on some planets which might not have any actual problems. And this issue is never even questioned by any of the characters. They just try to play the card that Thanos should try to save people, not kill them. Not a bad point. But it didn't seem like any of the Avengers seemed even remotely interesting in addressing Thanos' concerns. Not even Gamora.

Plus, if someone gets two or three of these infinity stones, let alone all of them, can't they use that person yield that power to do good rather than evil? It just didn't settle very well with me. Loki was a much better villain because he's like the Joker. Destruction and chaos is his high. That's a real thing in people that an audience should be able to understand.

The strength of this movie is the humor. I laughed repeatedly and was certainly entertained in that regard. It also, no surprise, looked really good and had great music. I was surprised how well the Guardians characters fit in with the other Marvel characters. But to me a feature length movie, even a short one, can't be good if the story isn't compelling. And this movie is long.

If the villain's story was halfway decent it would have stood a good shot, but just getting characters together that one likes and making a spectacle, won't make up for giant flaws in the story.

I didn't expect everything to be concluded, because these movie all set up more to come. But with an ending like this film has, it should have been advertised as the 1st part of 2 movies from the start. I really don't get how the next Ant-Man movie is going to work after what happened here in Inifinity Wars. Unless it takes place prior to the events of Infinity Wars, I don't see it working. But if that's the case, why not have Ant Man 2 come out first?

I'm not a comic book reader. I open them up, look at the picture and think:

""I'm supposed to take these silly-looking overdramatic characters and pictures seriously? Do other people see how goofy these images are? What am I, 10?

But I've heard from friends who like the comics that much of the events of this film unfolded as they did to stay loyal to the events in the comics. My response to this is that every form of entertainment's first goal should be to work within its own form. To me Infinity Wars' narrative doesn't work for a feature movie. I was upset with how it ended. And I know I wasn't the only one in the theater upset. And I find it disgraceful that, at the moment, this movie has 8.9 stars out of 10. Black Panther doesn't have 8 and it's actually good. What's wrong with people? This movie is currently ranked ahead of movies like 12 Angry Men, Casablanca, Dr. Strangelove, It's a Wonder life, American History X, The Prestige or Every Single Pixar Movie. What is wrong with people?",4

Marvel fanservice,2 May 2018,"I've been a Marvel fan ever since the Avengers came out. I watched it on the first Saturday the Firday came out. And the movie was epic. Ever since then, I've watched all of them in the theaters. And the shows. Then this movie came out and I was pleased with the overall story and all the heroes together to fight the villain we'd all been waiting for.

It's true this had a lot of movie to be considered a good ""summer film"", but this had some flaws in cgi and (maybe) audio i general. The cgi on Thanos was great, but sometimes the movement of characters in the movie was just stiff with a low range of movement. In the first Avengers, we had Hulk flying and flexible, here he is with stiff fighting against Thanos. There's many examples.

The music has been overused plenty of times, and tracks from previous movies has been recycled. This can be both good and bad. Pro, it has an epic compilation of music. Con, the music has no creativity as it's just reused.

Also another one audio. Two times in the theater, the audio of the characters talking sounded like it was from an 80s film. It sounded so scuffed and muffled. Then when I watched it at home, it was a little more clear. This was the first movie for me to have been bad in the theater, but good at home. So, this movie will get a 7. The real fanservice made this great for a marvel movie, but there was some issues scattered throughout the movie.",7

"Very good and solid movie, with some noteworthy flaws",3 August 2018,"So it's finnally here, and was really worth the wait. So let's dive into it. All the acting was pretty solid and good but was never weak. The main reason I gave this movie a 7 instead of a 6 is because of how well it handeled it's sub plots so well. I looked at how little each character actually got on screen. It really didn't feel like that in movie. That put aside let's talk about the plot overall. The plot was pretty good and I felt it was well paced. There really felt like there was a reason to worry for these characters and I felt true suspense. Thanos motivations are pretty good until you think about it to much. It really tears the movie down when you do, so it was a bit forgiving to let it slide and keep this a 7/10 instead of a 6/10. Overall it was a really good time and I really enjoyed myself watching it. I suggest it to any McU fan and anyone looking for good natured action and suspense.

I hope you enjoyed my review and have a great day",6
What the hell,20 June 2018,"I mean this was a decent movie, but come on. Ranking above "" It's a Wonderful Life "" and ""The Usual Suspects "" is bullshit. Marvel doesn't make cinematic classics, they make action filled blockbusters with no substance and 8 year old could understand. Take notes from Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight, because that is a real tale of humanity, and human vulnerability in the face of action. Quit with this bull crap and give it a ranking it deserves.",1
The best Marvel movie ever,5 April 2023,"This film tells us the story of the Avengers, to close a chapter.... It surprised me.... I loved it...

The timeline of films, from Hulk, Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Doctor Strange, Spider-Man, Ant-Man, Guardians of the Galaxy, Black Panther, Captain Marvel, Black Widow, and the other parallel films, led us to that last movie Avengers: Infinity War... I'm waiting for the next Marvel movie to send us to another universe, again.... Soon Marvel will release the new movies.... I can't wait to watch the movie where RDJ returns as Iron Man.",10
Just because I love avengers I'll give it 9....,29 April 2018,"Well it's an avengers' movie so the rate base has to be start at an 8 and all those superheroes are here with their coolest skills all in one movie, this is exciting. The images are great, the acting part is great, all the jokes from every marvel movies all comes together just make audience can't stop laughing. BUT. Admit it the logic of it is crap. I mean all avengers swore to protect lives in the whole universe that's why they are fighting the weird chin guy but somehow for the bad guy to win is simply threading their teammates? WHAT? Then what's all the efforts about?! I'm genuinely furious and speechless when they fought so hard after battle and battle then just cave 'alright mate I'll give you what you want but let him live'. They can come up with a better script than this ok? But after all it's a mind blowing film. I loved it, definitely gonna watch it agagin for all the fight scenes.",9
A great movie,29 April 2018,"It's agreat movie from marvel with unexpected end and the graphics was very good , but there is alot of comedy in some scenes require darkness",10
Thanos Is Coming,25 April 2019,"I have not seen all 21 films in the story arc that serves as the background for this penultimate episode in the MCU series that will soon culminate in ""Avengers: Endgame"". Seeing those films could only help, but it is not necessary. A general knowledge of the Marvel characters is probably enough to enjoy this wonderful spectacle.

A complex villain named Thanos is determined to collect all six of the infinity stones, which would give him nearly infinite power. An extraordinarily large cast of Marvel superheroes combines forces to stop him. CGI is used in abundance to create a non-stop display of environments and conflicts.

Like other Marvel films, the production relies on three major cornerstones to create an enjoyable experience:

1. Comedy is used to offset the heavy emotional elements of the film. Sometimes this is achieved by juxtaposing grandiose speech with commonplace speech, often employing pop culture references.

2. Suspension of disbelief is required in large doses to allow the writers to manipulate the epic elements of the story for conflict and dramatic effect.

3. Larger-than-life environments are used for their wow factor.

""Infinity War"" has these three elements in spades. The plot requires our heroes to overcome nearly impossible odds, say 1 in 14,000,605. Disparate factions of the Marvel superheroes collection are introduced to each other in an all out battle. The film ends with the ultimate cliffhanger, especially considering that Marvel promises a grand conclusion that will reset Marvel's future forever.",9

cool scenes but couldve been better thanos is weaker than he is in comics. black order is way worse!

for character strengths, whos ever stronger than another?! one character looks weak at a time OBVIOUSLY to pave way for ""heroic"" scene or entry of another and later the same character does a move proving to be the strongest in the battle zone. screw this logic.

also, if infinity stones are from before the universe, blah blah blah, how do they only affect a mile long lmao? so either thanos is weak or the stones (or both) in mcu",1

One of the best comic books movies ever!,30 July 2018,"This movie is a reward for everyone who follows the mcu movies since the first iron man. This movie can be a one big mess for people that never watch the previos movies of marvel, but if you do you will enjoy every second of this film it has great action and great story and one of the best villans every put in a comics book movie, and the ending is very brave and I never saw a film that end the way infinity war ended and I just can't wait for the second part.

This is finale of decade long and exhausting of marvel journey. Everyone in my country (Indonesia) sure had a lot expectations comes from this franchise. To sums it up it is the most ambitious not only for hero movie but whole movie industry with huge cast, mesmerizing cgi, which lead to the huge budget pour to the project. And ladies and gentlemen, avengers infinity wars lies upon you. I'm enjoying every moment Russo has to offer, and find my self drowning in the plot. Unfortunately, too many heroes need to shines, cast away the spotlight of main event. Everyone's plot felt rushed into one and another. This is the failure you can find in Batman vs superman. One time focus on captain America, ok it's done move your way to iron man, go go go to guys of guardian of galaxy, enough back to captain. And it goes over and over again until ending credit rolls. It ruins the great moment that has been built, and you can guess the epic Part fail to show up. Too many plot holes in the movie, and Russo can't cover it, because 2 hours wasn't enough. Don't believe everything I've wrote, go see for your self. It's not only I want you to see why I give 8 out 10, but also I want to give credit to this movie. It's worthy to your hard earns money",8

If it takes 35 minutes for Cinema Wins to get through a movie it must be something special.

Infinity War is 2h29m of perfect pacing, wonderful action, funny interplay, jaw-dropping set-pieces, perfectly pitched character arcs, an amazing balance of the huge cast, acting that never puts a foot wrong....

Endlessly rewatchable, it could be said that Infinity War was under more pressure than any sequel ever to deliver, but that baton is now passed to 2019's Avengers film, as how do you follow something this....infinitely great.

Best Movie Of MCU... Incredible from start to finish,17 August 2021,"One of the best movie I've ever watch. This is probably the most popular superhero movie. This time the Avengers have to face the most powerful and dangerous villain Thanos, who collecting the infinity stones to kill half of the population of universe.

This movie is perfect in every category. Acting, Visual effects, BGM, direction, carecter development everything is outstanding. And each and every actor done their best performance. There are so many seens that gives me goosebumps, specially Thor's entry seen in Wakanda. I can watch this film millions of time.",10
if your not a fan of the mcu your not going to like it,31 July 2018,"Infinity war is more of a event then a movie because you can't make a three act structure with that many characters it's just them fighting but the movie still works because i know all them from the previous mcu movies, the visual effects look really good especially thanos he will hold up for a while but the cgi on the humans looked little bad, the only character who has any character development is thanos if anything he's the protagonist, you get his motivation you don't agree with him but you understand it what his trying to do, there are some subtle lines that remind you about some of that characters backstory but there are some bad lines in the movie, i was little disappointed because one of the main characters didn't have a lot screen time especially concerning how big of a character he is, there too many jokes in this movie even in the emotional moments which is kind annoying, overall if your a fan of the mcu you'll like it if your not then you not going to like.",
"Great as a part of the MCU, fails as a stand-alone movie.",12 June 2018,"While ""Infinity War"" is beyond impressive as a cinematic experience & the culmination of at least 6 years of planning it fails to stand alone as a movie. For fans of the MCU ,I belive this film is as close to perfect as marvel can get but (and there is a big but) if you have not watced the relatively recent marvel movies (""Thor: Ragnarok"", ""Captain America: Civil War"" etc.) the new Avengers movie is going to be an epic mess.

The fights are incredible, the emotions are intense & the villan is great for once but juggling that many characters is not simple in the lest. Some characters get epic arcs (Thor & Iron Man), other are dissapointing (Vision & Black Panther) & some are missing (Hawkeye & Ant Man).

At the end of the day ""Avengers: Infinity War"" is an epic adventure for marvel fans, it is a good movie & impressive in scope but if it were to be asked to stand alone it would crumble.",6
It's been almost one year,15 August 2021,"It's been nearly one year since I watched this movie. And I still haven't touched the End Game. Because no mater what Hollywood-ish happy ending the End Game has to offer, I don't want it. I want it to stay the way it ended in the Infinity War. Some of you may think this is weird, for someone to want a movie franchise like MCU to end this way. But I don't want to ruin the amazing cinema experience this movie offered to me. I don't think any Marvel movie ever made have offered this much entertainment, action and emotion at the same time.

"""In time... you will know what it's like to lose"". An Unbelievable Achievement.",30 April 2018,"I am absolutely floored. Disney and Marvel deserve the highest praise for what is undoubtedly the finest superhero movie ever made; both in its execution as a film, and its faithfulness to the original comicbook stories.

The Russo Brothers have gracefully culminated a decade of stories and characters toward what is without a doubt the MCU's magnum opus. We are once again awestruck by a collection of heroes so vast that it seems nearly impossible for them all to get their shining moments in a relatively short 160 minutes. Surely at least a few must be passed over or shuffled along? No. Everyone, and I MEAN everyone (including a shocking return for a character long thought dead) is here. They are all given the time they so rightfully deserve, and it is achieved without the story feeling disjointed or rushed.

I would not be at all surprised if there is a portion of the audience that is outraged at the ending (which I won't spoil for you here). It is, in the simplest terms possible, emotionally exhausting, especially if you have been a die hard MCU fan since 2008. Whereas other superhero stories have experimented with ""bittersweet"" endings, this one is simply bitter. But this is good. It means that Disney and Marvel respect the fans and the source materiel they are drawing upon. It means that they are willing to take risks, HUGE risks, for the sake of the saga they are in the midst of telling. They have enough regard for their fans that they are willing to allow them to feel sadness, simply because it is vital to the experience. This kind of integrity in storytelling is nothing short of admirable.

Bravo, Disney/Marvel, bravo.",10

All the buzz of Infinity Saga! THANOS and infinity stones,30 March 2020,"After the Thor ragnarok ending. Thanos is on his hunt for Infinity stones. Avengers are split up and without plan. Thanos has a plan, and a great one. Thanos is ready to sacrifice, but the Avengers arenot. Thanos snaps completing his destiny and removing half the life. This movie is about Thanos and all the setup that was set for him in Infinity Saga. Thanos is right in his conscious and is just watching the sunrise at his Garden!. He justifies the role of character.

Black order is weak. They couldve been more fierce. You have to deal with emotions and the deaths. This shows if you have a plan, execution and will you can do anything. and also when to strike the enemy (at their weakest) and till now they havent lost and when they lost, they lose big time.!",9

It was a good Movie,24 May 2019,"This Movie was good because it was all the movies from the last few years leading up to this,the final one was endgame but this was the cause for why they are desperate to kill thanos and not let him take all the stones . They're all in seperate places,some on earth others in a different planet trying to fight him but they weren't able to take all the stones and at the end most of the people disappear into dust. All the actors played their rolls really well. The theme of the film was really good because Iron man fought the man who who has kept sending people his way to attack him and the city.",9
"Decent, but overlong",7 January 2019,"The movie can be described as ""decent"" at its best. The movie fails in its length and use of CGI. I don't think there was a single camera shot that didn't include some kind of CGI. The acting was okay, but the humor was misplaced. It's time for the avenger movies to end.",

"10 years of waiting, payed off, BIG TIME!",27 April 2018,"Where to start... this is funny, action-packed, hold-your-breath epic blockbuster movie, and i can't wait to see it a few more times, cause it's so hard to process everything that happens in it. Russos did it again, i like that they dialed down the shaky cam to a minimum. the special effects are for sure the best i've ever seen in any movie, and that tells a lot for a movie that relies so much on them. Thanos...oh man... Josh Brolin NAILED IT! he's the best comic book villain to date, period! if i had to nitpick this movie, the only thing it would be is run-time (and it's the longest marvel movie to date), and that's just cause i wanted to see more of it, but don't worry everything that's important is there, every major character gets it's deserved screen time, some more than others, but don't forget that there's a sequel coming in a year, and it's gonna a be a longer wait than the previous 10

i don't want to call this movie a best marvel movie to date, cause it relies so much on previous ones, but man, this movie is really something.

stop reading now, and go watch it, see it for yourselves",10
Is this deserved ?,14 June 2018,"Look, the movie was really really good. I had fun watching it and it probably is one of the best MCU movies. HOWEVER. Can we consider Avengers 3 one of the greatest movie of all time ? Specially when it is just the first part of the thanos storyline !",7

A cinematic triumph 10 years in the making.,30 April 2018,"Reflecting back on the over dozen previous entries into the Marvel Cinematic Universe, it's clear that this is what we've been building toward for about a decade and it certainly pays off. From the first time Nick Fury showed up in an end credits scene and let us know that an MCU was about to takeoff, to the first time Thanos showed up in an end credit scene and told us that he was a threat to be afraid of, all the anticipation built to Avengers: Infinity War and the Russo brothers tell an awe inspiring story that makes the 10 year wait well worth it.

What may be a setback of the film for some more casual movie-goers, is that the film certainly doesn't hold your hand or spend anytime introducing you to the heroes of the MCU. You're expected to be familiar with large scale events that took place previously in the universe and the characters who are involved in it. I for one, am thankful they went this route as I don't possibly see any way that this story could have been told in it's time constraint with character reintroductions at every turn. The movie is fast paced chaos and the tone as set right off the bat.

The CGI is near perfection. Thanos, a near full CGI villain with motion capture done by Josh Brolin, is truly brought to life. It's always good to be wary with CGI villains since we so often see them fail miserably, but Thanos was pulled into our reality by the animators with every minute facial expression, squint, and wince. The brilliant voiceover work by Josh Brolin certainly helped establish the villain as well.

The performances by the massive, wonderful cast are all done to near perfection. No one misses a beat and they all stay true to their characters, which is also a testament to how well the Russo brothers worked with the task of bringing MCU characters into their film who were previously established by other minds in their own standalone films.

That's all I want to get into to spare spoiling anything, but I can't recommend this enough. If you haven't seen an MCU film prior to this one, I highly suggest checking out at least the previous two Avengers films if not the entire MCU before arriving to this film.",9
Worth the hype!!,28 April 2018,"I loved it and after Watching it I wanted to see it again. However after reading some of the reviews on IMDb it didn't felt like I watched the same movie as everybody else! Some people said it had plot holes, characters where out their character and complained about the ending...

For starters the people who gave this movie a low rating could not have possibly seen all marvel movies that comes before infinity war. Yeah you get plot holes if you miss a movie or two or all! You can't just watch the avengers movies to get this one, it ain't possible!

And characters has changed. From the latest avengers movie because there are a lot of other movies between this one! character change but it's not like we haven't seen the development...

If you come and see the movie you know this one is in two parts... if you didn't know that then where have you been? You can't complain about something we all knew before seeing the movie. Of course there is a cliffhanger and we want to know what happens but that's the point... you can't fit so much in a movie

Overall if you haven't watched all the marvel movies before watching this one don't watch it! You ruins it for everyone else. I've watched all the other movies and I loved this one. It has action, emotion, humour and suspense! This was a hit!!",10

Without the celestrials there is no way in hell to fix the problem....

For a director(s) to take a work they themselves never created and change not only the characters but entire storyline is absolute rubbish.... Leave the characters the way they are and the storyline the way it was written or don't make the bloody movie....~,6
Long and Boring: Worst movie of 2018 so far,18 May 2018,"I'm not a fan of Marvel or DC or basically anything that Disney creates. Unfortunately, my friend wanted to see it and I figured: 1) There's a chance it could be good, considering there were other movies I thought were going to be bad, such as(Blockers, The Purge, Keanu, and even Wonder Woman) that turned out to be good, so I shouldn't pass this off right away just because it's Disney 2) I figured it couldn't be worse than Red Sparrow.

Anyway, I was wrong to both of those. This movie is 2 and a half hours of weak plot, little script, visually unappealing CGI, bad acting, and continuous violence.

The only person in this movie who had acting skills was Robert Downy Junior. Benedict Cumberbatch was so insufferable that it's shocking that he's the same person who starred in The Imitation Game, which is one of the best movies I've seen this decade.

The entire last hour was nothing but fighting, killing, and brutal violence. I honestly don't understand how they can get away with rating movies with this much murder PG-13, when movies with significantly less violence and murder, like John Wick and The Hitman's Bodyguard, are rated R. Apparently our backwards society has deemed that killing and violence is an acceptable thing for children to be exposed to, but hearing the word Fvck will traumatize them for life.

With the exception of Robert Downey Junior, the way the people talked reminded me of 11th grade English class when we would read Shakespeare aloud in class. Also, as someone who was forced to go to Catholic Church as a kid, if you've ever gone to the Good Friday or Palm Sunday mass where they all read that dialogue in monotonous voices that's so insufferable you're in pain? That's how I felt in this movie. I would've rather been a child at Good Friday mass again, because at least then there was prospect of a Cream Egg for sitting through that drawl.",1

Waiting for next Avernger,26 June 2018,"The Avenger and their allies must use all the power they have got in an attempt to defeat the powerful Thanos who tries to wipe out half of the life in the galaxy.

This is a long-awaited movie to be released by Marvel after they released many movies to introduce many characters associated with the film. Avenger Infinity War has over 20 main characters in total. They can do this because the background of each character has been described in their own movie, so when the movie starts, they can suddenly jump into the conflict without an introduction of the characters.

The production of this movie is absolutely fantastic, all stunts, actions, audios, and computer graphics are the best. There are a lot of things going on during 2 and a half hours period, the screen time distribution probably the most difficult part to deal with in my opinion. It came out OK but can be improved.

Moreover, this is one of the hero movies that the storyline is very hard to predict, making it recognizable and hard to forget. Although the movie answered the main question, it also makes up more questions at the end, make the audience demand for the next Avenger movie.",8

I've read the comics, so I knew what to expect, though I don't recall Guardians of the Galaxy characters in the original story. A lot of great action and surprisingly a lot of comedy still too! Spiderman had the best lines! A very good villain and overall super fun, yet darker movie. Not quite DC level dark, but emotionally I suppose. I did feel close to tears at one point actually, but it's because I've grown very attached to these characters. Of course it ended with a big cliff hanger to be continued next year, but I knew that going in.",9

Avengers IW - CGI Fest But Great,1 July 2018,"You have to give Marvel studios some credit. They have the job of making it the most hyped/ best marvel movie ever. The CGI was ok it wasn't the best, but there was so much pressure on Marvel. This movie was great, sad, but great. The story was well thought up and resembled the comics a ton. The character combinations went very well telling us they are in the same universe which makes the future way more exciting. Making the best movies puts a huge reliability on Marvel, every year people are excited for a new movie and they usual don't disappoint. Watch this movie you won't regret it.",10

Watching the sunset, he lamented the uncertainty of life and perhaps had time to raise chickens and other vegetables.

A fantastic addition to the MCU,29 April 2018,"This is a spoiler free review.

The film starts where Thor Ragnarok left off with the heroes confronting Thanos et al in a brief but well balanced scene setting the tone for the entire movie.

There is great action throughout with the main plot of the film being extremely simple, the collection of the Infinity Stones to conclude Thanos's vision of the universe based on his warped interpretation - kill a few to save a lot, mentality.

The pacing is great from start to finish and there are many wonderful moments to get your head around including some sadness which are all we placed. The humour is similar in tone to Thor Ragnarok but seem toned down when balanced out by the sad parts of the film.

Infinity War ends, as one would expect from a two part film on a shocking cliff hanger and I for one can't wait for part two!",9
"Moving ending, but the least of the Avengers movies IMHO",2 July 2018,"RELEASED IN 2018 and directed by Anthony & Joe Russo, ""Avengers: Infinity War"" chronicles events when the Avengers team-up with several allies to defeat the cosmic despot Thanos, whose goal is to collect all six Infinity Stones to attain unimaginable power and radically solve one of the Universe's most challenging problems.

The story focuses on Thanos, Thor and the Guardians of the Galaxy, especially Gamora, as well as Iron Man, Doctor Strange and Spider-Man. The rest of the cast members are more peripheral, e.g. Black Widow, Captain America, Black Panther, Vision and Scarlet Witch.

This is easily the least of the Avengers trilogy. Not to mention ""Captain America: Civil War"" (2016) and ""Thor: Ragnarok"" (2017) are significantly more compelling and all-around entertaining. Actually, all three Thor flicks are palpably superior, as is ""Iron Man 2"" (2010). If you haven't already, I encourage you to watch these movies prior to viewing ""Infinity War,"" as well as ""Black Panther"" (2018) and the two ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" flicks (2014/2017); otherwise you'll likely be lost because all these movies lead up to this one.

""Infinity War"" is certainly an ambitious comic book movie in that it notably juggles so many super-beings, but this lack of focus isn't conducive to suspense or great drama. It's merely decent with overkill CGI. The big battle in the closing act with the easily slaughtered four-armed dog-creatures is curiously dull; moreover, the attempts at humor sometimes feel forced and fall flat, but several jokes are laugh-out-loud funny, e.g. ""Rabbit."" Thankfully, the film adds moving drama and gets extra points for a bold, poignant climax, which sets up the 2019 sequel ""Endgame.""

THE MOVIE RUNS 2 hours, 29 minute and was shot in New York City, Scotland and Philippines with studio work done in Pinewood Atlanta Studios in Fayetteville, Georgia. WRITERS: Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely.

"Visually magnificent, technically state-of-the-art, dumber than a box of hammers",1 May 2018,,2
Avengers: Infinity War,29 June 2022,"What you will be getting when you walk into an inevitably overstuffed movie theater is something singular that reflects our age in a way that none of the MCU films that preceded it have-indeed, very few Hollywood spectacles ever have.",10
One hell of a first part,1 May 2018,"Let me start by saying that I am an avid MCU fan and have seen all the previous entries, however I can acknowledge when the franchise goes wrong (the sequels to Iron Man, Thor, and Avengers comes to mind). Infinity War did an utterly incredible job of tying together 10 years of storytelling. For what this movie was meant to be, I don't think they could have changed a thing to make it any better (save a few lines that didn't land or jokes that ran a bit too long). The acting and dialogue is on par with the past few movies, with good performances all around, but some really stand out ones from Chris Hemsworth, Zoe Saldana, and of course Josh Brolin. The action is great, there's good close cut hand to hand scenes that the Russos are famous for and more impressive sprawling epic battle scenes as well. The CGI is mostly good, especially on Thanos and the alien planets, however a few of the children of Thanos did look like 4 year old video game characters to me. The biggest criticism I've heard of this movie is that it's inaccessible to non-MCU fans, which I think is perfectly valid. If you've only seen a scattered few of the movies, you could very likely get lost as they don't spend time re-introducing characters and previous plot lines. I will say however, that at this point, 19 movies in, you should probably have developed an opinion on the MCU by now. Those who thoroughly enjoy the stories and characters will be caught up and this movie will blow them away. For people who are more casual fans who just go for the action and jokes and aren't wrapped up in the overarching plots and character arcs, Infinity War can still deliver exactly what they want. Lastly, for people who just flat out dislike the franchise, this movie won't change their mind. It's more of what we've gotten in the previous 18 entries but on a more epic scale. As a hard-core fan, this movie had me wanting to jump out of my seat and cheer at some moments, and cry at others. Infinity War is truly the reward fans of the franchise are getting after 10 years. I will say however, that it is hard to rank it compared to the rest of the MCU. Since this movie ends on such a large cliff hanger that must be resolved in the follow up, it's very hard to look at it as a complete story. My guess is that people will lump Infinity War and Avengers 4 together as one large movie, much like people do with Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows part 1 and 2. If the follow up sticks the landing and completes this story in a compelling way, then this movie would probably land in my top 5 just above the first Avengers, but conversely it could get dragged down if the sequel doesn't hold up. I cannot wait to see how this story is wrapped up next year, and strongly encourage fans of the franchise to check this one out in theaters. If you haven't yet discovered the joys of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, certainly don't start with this one, but make sure you come back to it 18 movies later. It's worth the wait.",9

Just wow,29 April 2018,"This is the first review I've ever written, and I think this is the perfect movie to take that spot. This is one of the best movies I've seen in a very long time and my favorite MCU film to date. I'm a particularly big fan of how they took the character arc of Thor, I thought it was very well done. The humor felt natural to the characters, and not shoehorned in as I felt some of the jokes were in Ragnarok (also an enjoyable film, though). There were some moments of humor that didn't quite land with me, but that's okay. I also very much liked how the handled Thanos and the movie, to me, is more of a Thanos film than an Avengers film. Josh Brolin does an excellent job. There is one particularly emotional scene and I almost began to sympathize with him. Those who have seen the film will know what I'm referring to. There are many surprises and things you won't see coming. I went in only having seen one or two of the trailers, and I'm glad I did. See it as soon as you can and avoid spoilers as much as possible. It is, to me, a truly excellent film. 10/10 would recommend and 10/10 would watch again.",10

The delivery of the movie was better than a marvel fan expections. You just can't put your eyes from the movie for 2:30 hours. Infinity war is not only a complete package of actions, but also a mixture of fun, joy, emotions and heart breaking incidents.

Entertaining & Blockbuster stuff but why such incomplete and complicated end,27 April 2018,"AVENGERS INFINITY WAR REVIEW :

A wait of so many years, an anticipation built through so many superhero movies and wait for Super Villain finally comes to the end with Large scale visual spectacular called Infinity War. I was so excited but kept expectations low as such superhero flicks entertain you but usually lacks the content. Infinity War is Super Entertaining, it has all the elements what one expect from Marvel's Biggest Film ever but why such Incomplete, complicated and negative end? Film starts on the good note, doesn't take too much time to set unlike other Superhero films. Thanos looks so powerful and we don't wanna see our Avengers looking so weak for the first time. We expect them to smash Thanos but we'll have to wait for Infinity War 2 for that and that's where film looks slightly incomplete at the end. Watch out for the post end credit scene, that might increase your excitement for the sequel. When film ended i felt like it's Interval and i want to see more, but have to wait 1 year more for that. Poor me. Film has so many pluses but has got some minuses too. Let's take a look at them. Pluses- Visually spectacular, goosebumps while seeing so many superheroes together and their strong come-Backs, Strong Villain, pacy screenplay, Comedy, Explosion etc. Minuses- Heroes looking Weak in front of Villain, unnecessary love making scenes between few avengers, useless emotional scenes between Thanos & Gamora, Lose climax, so many unanswered questions. Overall, Avengers Infinity War is just another Entertaining film from Marvel, nothing Extraordinary despite gathering 20+ superheroes in a single film. Film worths the long wait of viewers but nothing memorable to be left with. Film left viewers with more questions than answers. The excitement for the film was so high that some fans even went on to predict that this film will beat Box office records of Avatar, Sorry to say this, forget Avatar but even $2 Billion can't happen with this Product. I will not say you should skip the film but i can't even strongly recommend you. I'm going with 7/10* which is same as almost every superhero film from Marvel has got from me. Last but not the least, there are No such things called spoilers like who dies in the end, so many disappears but only to come back in a style with Infinity War 2.",7

A masterpiece,16 June 2018,"Please don't take into consideration these low iq 1/10 reviews, as no matter how the movie was most of these people would still rate it that. Their points are usually vague 'bad storytelling' I see a lot, but I can guarantee you these same people couldn't formulate a comprehensive complaint of why they didn't like the story. All and all a great movie, don't let these butt hurt imbeciles with a predetermined hatred of the MCU dissuade you, because at the end of the day it's one of the highest grossing films of all time and has an 8.9 here for a reason :).",10
My fav: The Almighty Thanos,12 July 2022,"It was a fabulous movie much better than the Endgame one. Fighting the villain and trying to win is the goal of the Avengers.

"Wonderful, Superb, Marvelous, Awesome...etc.,",29 April 2018,"I would like to thank Kevin Feige, Russo Bro's, Screenplay writers and all the cast along with everyone involved in the movie. It's worth a long wait for the fans. Well, I had more and more expectations from the movie, but this movie exceeded my expectations. I watched it in IMAX and it's a worth movie watching in IMAX screen. Although the movie runs for 2 and half hours odd, but the screenplay is done so nicely that you'll feel the movie is fast. Thanks @Marvel Studios for giving us the awesome entertainment from the last 10 years and I'm sure you'll keep giving the same in future.",10
A nice movie with a bad ending,26 April 2018,,7
One of Marvels best movies!,7 July 2022,"Marvel has done it again! This Avengers movie brings in one of the biggest cast and mangers to to use every character and tell their story's without over doing it and without under using any of the characters but one I'd say. They manage to tell the story with several side plots that make sense throughout the movie and keeps you engaged the hole time though.

Now for the character that I think didn't get any character development was Black Widow she is hardly seen in this movie and every time she is on screen she is under use and gets no character Development.

The rest of the cast are used to their best of the ability.

Robert Downey Jr, Chris Evens and Chris Hemsworth are the best out of the cast in this one they bring the best performances and they bring really funny moments. I also got to mention Josh Brolin he gives one of the most terrifying and menacing villains yet.

Overall a great Avengers movie!",10

Dichotomy of the characters,28 April 2018,"This is not just a movie. It is an intricate symbiosis of strong emotions which were lost somewhere in time till now. It is no doubt by far the most heart quenching, questioning piece of superhero franchise movie who has made me go to a state of no-judgmental state of a fan. This movie is not about wow factor or box office or fan club. It is realisation.",10
What I want in a MCU,29 April 2018,"As a Marvel comics and movies fan, I found this film to be quite enjoyable and what I want to see in a MCU film. It has that feel of taking your Marvel action figures out of the toy box and creating your own story. It has the feel of a hash up of multiple characters tossed together fighting against pure evil which works well for this type of film. It has the feel of exactly what I would expect a super hero film to be, and what I would want it to be. With this in mind, I want to examine four aspects I enjoyed and some which I didn't.

There are many aspects to like about this film, in my opinion, from the separate stories to the humor to the emotional roller coaster to the development of its main antagonist, this film hits on many marks. To start, I enjoyed the portrayal of different groups pursuing their missions because I really think the multiple stories emboldens what you would find occurring in actual comic story lines. Bringing the MCU a realistic comic book feel. Each group is on a path to prevent/protect something, and given the multitude of characters in the film, this is the best way to handle them - by giving them all individual goals to achieve. These goals is what sets up the plot, while admittedly a simple plot (This is a super hero movie after all), their is still a purpose, a pursuit, and a journey that our heroes travel on which keeps the movie progressing forward. This also works for the movie because it mix and matches different heroes in uniquely pleasant ways, providing the opportunity for humor.

This brings me to the second and third aspects I enjoyed about this film. The humor, for me, landed well and increased my enjoyment of the film. Humor is a everyday part of our lives, even when we are faced with challenging situations. This movie does well to keep this aspect of humanity alive in a world where threat of danger isn't only probable, its a reality. Keeping up a lighter air at moments provides a roller coaster ride of sorts,producing a variety of emotions throughout the film. We, the viewer, is taken through this emotional journey just like how the characters themselves experience. This leaves me with strong feelings about events that occur in the film, and any film that can do that gets a high grade from me.

Lastly, the development of the main antagonist was one of the greatest aspects of this film. They took a villain and gave him a down to earth persona. They gave him viable and believable motivations. They gave him emotions. All of this results in the need for him to make sacrifices in the pursuit of his purpose. While his intentions may be rooted in good intentions, they still amount to an evil plan that will result in a colossal amount of lost lives. This makes for a completely evil and menacing villain, which is necessarily for a film that has been ten years in the making.

Keeping in mind that this is first and foremost a super hero action flick meant solely to entertain, there are still some negative aspects/issues I have concerning this film. What comes to mind first is how some heroes were weaken while others were strengthen. I admit I can get past this, but Marvel should know how to avoid this inconsistency. On the same note, some characters from previous MCU films were no where to be seen. Some characters were left in the same place we returned to in this film. No explanation given, what? Let me remark real quick on the ending since many others have complained about this for one reason or another. All I'm going to say is that we, as viewers and fans, may know what will end up happening in the next movie. I for one will enjoy the ride on how we get there. Just because an assumption may draw us to a particular conclusion, doesn't mean the journey to get there won't be a wealth of entertainment.

While I touched on the four main aspects I enjoyed, my enjoyment is not limited to multiple stories, humor, emotional roller coaster, and the antagonist. The directors also did a great job of capturing the tone of each character / film series keeping the spirit of all the MCU franchises continuous. The effects, as usual for an MCU movie, were terrific without overshadowing the performances of its cast. The action scenes were thrilling and inviting, boosting up my adrenaline level and continuing the emotional roller coaster I mentioned. A roller coaster caused from humor, destruction, evil, and the hope for our heroes' success. The film does have lapses in some elements, but that doesn't in any way diminish the enjoyment of this film. Despite the negatives, the film is an overall enjoyable, fun ride through an imaginary world of super heroes.",9
Absolutely amazing.,29 April 2018,,10
Everything you wanted and more,29 April 2018,"I had been waiting for this movie to come out for 10 years now, and it was definitely worth the wait. Avengers: Infinity War tells the story of the infamous Thanos and his sworn duty to balance the universe by wiping out half of its population. To do this he requires the 6 infinity stones that, when all together, form a weapon capable of doing so. The avengers, guardians of the galaxy and other hero's must join together to stop the mad titan before he can get all of the stones.

There are a lot of characters in this movie, so the directors, Joe and Anthony Russo, had a large task ahead of them as they had to balance each character in the story. They did a great job of that, and each character got an ample amount of screen time. The movie does imply that The audience has seen The movies leading up to this, and doesn't directly introduce all of the characters or who they are. The story was the best part of the movie, I won't get into details to avoid spoiling the plot, but it was simply amazing. There were a few holes that could have been fixed, omitted, or explained, but they weren't too bad. The movie is set in the aftermath of the events at the end of Captain America: Civil War and Thor: Ragnarok.

Throughout the film different planets are explored, each with a unique look. The visual effects of these planets, the characters, and the action were top notch. They definitely showed off this movie's $300 million budget. The movie flowed very well considering how much was actually happening all at once. There were a few times that it felt a bit clunky, but it didn't take away from its overall progression.

I had very high expectations for this movie going in, and I'm happy to say that they were exceeded. I typically try to be as critical as I can with these movies, and though it was not perfect, it still was, in my opinion, the best marvel movie to date, and one of my all time favorite movies.",9
"SUCH MAGNITUDE. It's the best movie, not just the best Super hero movie, It's the best movie I have ever seen 👑",20 March 2020,"Basically it's the Best movie I have ever seen, it is also the Greatest Cinematic Experience I have been a part of, and it has the best Villain I have ever witnessed. Nothing I have seen in a Cinema has been remotely close to this experience. This is the Apex of Marvel.

Pieces of this Masterpiece:

° Thanos is the best villain that was ever written. He has hunger and drive, he radiates power, he is a deep philosopher and he also has emotional depth to his character. He had a task to undertake and after, he just wanted to sit down and watch the sunset when he had accomplished the mission.

° The going from one planet to the next and exploring the galaxy thorough cinematic means gives the movie a Swift and Compelling feel to it.

° When the huge Ring Ship enters the Earth, you could feel the stakes and notches went up by 2.

° The Entire Movie Felt like a Major World Event

° You could really feel the stakes at hand for the Avengers since the Hulk is removed from the equation.

° There is a specific battle that is made really well. The sounds in that battle were terrific. It was Very very Good.

° The 'Did you do it' scene really tugged at the heart strings. It was powerful.

° The Demonstration of Each of the Infinity Stones were Great 👍

° The Audience I was with actually felt the snap. I heard the gasps in the Audience.

° The Ending was Absolute Perfection

I don't think I will witness anything like This for quite some time. I think only when Galactus himself appears, I would get the same feeling or perhaps of an even greater Magnitude than I had with Infinity War.

Infinity War is a Masterwork. It is Marvels Magnum Opus and it cannot be repeated. I am just Joyful that I got to Witness it. 👏",10
LITERALLY THE BEST MARVEL,15 May 2024,"Where can I start ? Avengers Infinity War is an incredible masterpiece and THE BEST SUPERHERO MOVIE OF ALL TIME. Finally a good&powerful villain ! Thanos is THE villain by excellence. He is not only awesomely frightening but has also a significant motivation. Moreover the Avengers have finally an EPIC scene fight. Thor's entrance is extremely prestigious ! And I won't talk about the end but waouh i'm literally in shock... NOW let's talk about the spectacular images and soundtracks of the movie ! THE RUSSO brothers have managed to create a ""chef d'oeuvre"". I'm crying rn because it will be difficult to watch a superhero movie as good as this one in the future.

PS: THANK YOU FOR THIS MOVIE THAT REPRESENT FINALLY THE GREATNESS THAT ARE ""THE AVENGERS""",10
Liked but not Loved,27 April 2018,"I'm really mixed to positive on this one. It's hard to explain my feelings about the movie without spoiling it, so I'll say this: the things that this movie does well, it does it REALLY well. Thanos was great as villain (his motives, not so much), the action scenes were good, I liked most of the character interactions, there were some emotional scenes that were done well, and a few things will transpire that you won't see coming, which was very exciting. After Thor's last atrocious solo outing (Ragnarok), I didn't really care much for his character but this time around, the Russo's brought the thunder (pun intended); he was my favorite of all the Avengers in this film (even though there were some still some residual Ragnarok traits, I'm willing to forgive them). The things that it does bad, it does REALLY bad. A lot of the humor was contrived; some of those emotional/dramatic scenes were ruined by poorly timed jokes, something that Ragnarok and GotGv2 suffered from immensely. Towards the middle of the film, the scenes seemed to kind of jump all over the place but that's just a small nitpick on my part. Certain characters were handled in a way that really bothered me, but I can't divulge on that point without spoilers. Lastly, the ending just fell flat for me; I understand what they were trying to do with the ending and it DID work to some degree, but for everything that happened in the movie and for it to end the way it did...it just didn't sit well with me. Overall, I thought the movie was good...the Russo Brothers are excellent directors (Winter Soldier is still, by far, my favorite MCU film) and I'm ready to see what they have in store for Avengers 4!!! 3.5/5 Stars",7
"Wow, just wow!",29 April 2018,"I will not provide any spoilers here, so you're welcome to read on.

So where to start? There's great comic moments, interspersed with some very tragic moments and the best action scenes I think I've ever seen in a film.

Josh Brolin is tremendous as the super villain, Thanos. You kind of half feel sorry for him, his voice coming across as someone hell bent on achieving the aim of collecting all the stones - almost as if it's his destiny and only way to achieve some sort of everlasting piece. There's times when he appears to show empathy and remorse yet still continues on his path.

If someone wants to flag that as a spoiler ^ that's fine. All I'll say is he is the best villain in any comic book movie, ever.

All of the other characters are fantastic, with particular mention to Dave Bautista for some of the funniest lines in the movie.

You will love it, hate it and most definitely will be hiding behind your hand on quite a few occasions.

Only 3 films I've seen are better: Shawshank, Inception and Dark Knight. That's how good this is!

I'll definitely be watching it a second time.

It's ok...,5 May 2018,"As a fan of the real Infinty War saga in Marvel comics this film held no surprises other than the fact that it lacks so many of the heroes that actually faught in the war, including the one that saves the universe (and I'm not talking about Captain Marvel that the epilogue eludes to). It was entertaining at the time but it really was nothing more than a ""look how many big name actors we fit into one movie"" experience.",7
Wow that was trash,30 April 2018,,1
Thanos: A Villain's Journey,30 April 2018,"Avengers: Infinity War Film review By Nelson Nantanapibul Directed by Anthony and Joe Russo Starring: Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, Benedict Cumberbatch, Tom Holland, Chadwick Boseman, Chris Pratt, Josh Brolin... The MCU as it's known is 10 years old and has achieved massive financial and critical success which has culminated in the mother of all crossover events in Avengers: Infinity War. Now even though I admire the MCU and what it has accomplished (at least for me) not every film has hit it out of the park story wise and yet most of their films across the board seem to garner near identical critical praise with some rare exceptions. I loved the first Avengers film and saw it eight times in theaters during its original theatrical run. Age of Ultron fell far short of my expectations and in my opinion was their first major misstep narratively and yet that film still made over a billion dollars worldwide and appeared to be critic proof. Then Civil War came along helmed by the Russo Bros and and though it was billed as a Captain America film it was essentially The Avengers 2.5. I'm guessing that was a trial run for the Russos to see if they were worthy of taking over the next major chapter in the Avengers saga and they do not disappoint. Infinity War has the emotional depth that I find lacking in the majority of MCU films and they give us a villain in Thanos who is not only worthy enough to face off against earth's mightiest heroes but is the centerpiece of this film. This is his story all the way through with our heroes serving as the supporting cast. Most MCU villains are completely lackluster and quite frankly have not been all that interesting save for a few such as Loki, Red Skull and the Vulture. Thanos is billed as ""The Mad Titan"" in the comics but in Josh Brolin's performance he comes off as anything but. There is a method to Thanos' madness in the film and he (at least in his own mind) is the hero of this epic story. The best villains in cinema and literature are the ones who do not act purely out of evil intent but who feel as if what they are doing is just and cause and cannot understand why others cannot see things as they do. Thanos has a twisted sense of love and loyalty but he does possess those emotions and they are in full display in this film. Thanos is a fully realized character and has an arc in this film usually reserved for the heroes of the MCU. The Russos have taken the template of the MCU films which had started to become predictable and bland (at least for me) and completely do their own thing under the watchful eye of Kevin Feige to be sure. This film is full of surprises and doesn't always go the way viewers expect it to and in one instance they kind of psyche you out in thinking one thing will happen and pull the rug out from under you. I cannot elaborate without spoiling what the scene is but it definitely had the audience at my screening audibly gasp out loud. For the first time in a long time I have actually felt like there were actual stakes in an MCU film where just about anything could happen and they set up those expectations from the get go. The Russos do not waste time in getting us into the action and they stomp their foot on the gas up until the very end. This film had the usual brand of MCU style humor but didn't overstaurate the viewers with it the way I feel other films in the universe have begun to overly rely on it in lieu of character and plot development. The film also has great emotional depth and resonance that I have not felt within the MCU for a very long time. There were some moments in the film where I thought, I can't believe they actually went there. There was only one time in the film where I felt that they played it safe in terms of the fate of a character where if they had followed through on it would have really thrown viewers for a loop. Marvel has delivered something amazing with this film. The MCU could go in any direction from here on out. Actually if this were to be the last film in the MCU franchise (it's not) it would be a satisfying if somewhat dark and dreary way to end things but it could end. I highly recommend this film and what has been accomplished by the Fiege braintrust is nothing short of amazing and (almost) unheard of. The shared cinematic universe is not a new concept but it has not been accomplished on a scale of this size and it has yet to be successfully emulated by other studios. Definitely see this film and see how seamlessly the Russos intertwine so many characters together with Thanos serving as the thread that ties everything together from one scene to the next.",9
EPIC EVENT,19 February 2019,It was Epic no doubt every character was well utilised well introduced thank you Marvel Studios for this Epic Movie,10
Amazing,29 April 2018,"The last movie I saw in theaters, was The Last Jedi, which made me think Disney is going to ruin everything I love. Thankfully, Avengers was amazing and I recommend everyone to go see it. The story is so incredible! I had some ideas about how the story was going to play out, but it was so much better then I could have imagined. It starts off strong and keeps the momentum going til the very end. In between these beautiful scenes, are wonderfully emotional moments, with the characters we have all grown to love. The most delightful surprise, were the funny moments, very similar to the humor in Thor Ragnarok. Easily my favorite marvel movie so far, but the next Avengers movie will probably be even better!",10

This is what a group play should be.,12 April 2020,"It is recommended that you drink less water, because this is almost a zero point movie, nearly two and a half hours from beginning to end. A few places do not play, or the place that the rhythm is more gentle has before and after looking after, is not idle pen.

Although there are a lot of violent scenes, there are also plenty of funny points, and all kinds of jokes are everywhere, forming a buffer between the endless fierce battles. (although I'm not happy with the Internet slang used in the subtitles) and iron man is as mean and fart as ever, the captain of the solemn veteran + commissioner, brother hammer that pose is show MOE, there is a reference to the original black widow sister and hawkeye relationship, and finally see a brain of Dr. Banner. As an adaptation, there are many things to please comic fans, including classic lines.

Original characters like agent colson are also great (my favorite in the whole series). His final performance may feel a little bit overrated, but for him, it's actually dark in his belly, so deep in his consciousness that all he can think about is how to make the most of the situation.

Although it draws a lot of elements from the ultimate universe, including the characters' costumes and the names of alien RACES, the movie is not the world view of the ultimate universe. It seems to be a mix of the main world and the ultimate world. Loki says that he has an army, and that the aliens are really tough hybrid soldiers without any of the machismo of the original, but the post-credits Easter egg reveals that the really tough guys are still out there.

As a group of heroes, the film is thoughtful: each character has enough to show for their character and ability, and the interaction between them is interesting. Avengers protagonist, is a team. The growth of the protagonist, here is the team of the run-in. See them from each other pk (this pk has a tribute to the original reason), to two cooperation, and then to the overall cooperation, the context and rhythm are very clear.

Unlike the x-men, which are dominated by young students, the avengers are established heroes. So the movie borrows entirely from the comic book model of the year -- starting with the individual story of each member and then the origins of the team.

Marvel had previously used five feature films plus two shorts as a starting point. Therefore, it does not need to explain the history and background of each person in detail in the film, but only carries out the ""simplest"" explanation, showing the core characteristics of each character. (the better part is showing another aspect of the hulk, Bruce banner as a famous scientist, which the hulk lacks.) This spare time is all focused on the core events, so the film can climax, burning the sky.

This is a good example of how to make a team of heroes, but can this model be copied? Who could have done ten hours of foreplay for a movie that always had an orgasm? (I saw this film, dc pressure is very big, I hope one or two films against the sky, after all, it is not as good as M's solid accumulation of six years)",8
Better than expected,8 June 2018,"I am a HUGE Marvel nerd and was excited for this movie. I didn't expect it to be good, but it was WAY BETTER than I had expected.",

Strong piece of escapism,2 April 2021,"Thanos puts his master plan into action.

This is an enjoyable action-adventure set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

The primary function of the storytelling is to bring everything developed so far in the MCU together using the infinity stones mcguffin and give lots of popular franchise characters the opportunity to share the screen. This for the majority of the movie is done successfully.

Rather than throw everyone together the writers sensibly opt to group certain characters together for the majority of the running time. It helps that many of the characters have natural chemistry that generates much humour.

In some ways it reminds me of Lord Of The Rings with its ensemble of characters undergoing a variety of adventures towards the same objective of preventing a powerful antagonist obtaining the ultimate weapon. Overall it works very well, providing solid entertainment, mostly good dialogue and the great spectacle of seeing famous superheroes combine powers to battle a common enemy.

The themes are moderately interesting, with familiar superhero movie subjects of heroism, sacrifice and genocide a big part of it. The concept of the universe having finite resources and Thanos extremist idea to solve the problem is the most memorable. Ultimately it's a mainstream, popcorn cinematic event with escapism and enjoyment as its main priority and it does its job.

There are strong character moments, humour, emotional scenes and of course the hyperkinetic action sequences. All this is combines well for the all round entertainment value.

As you can imagine for a marvel blockbuster, the visuals and effects are loud, colourful, eye-popping and very well designed. For me it just about reigns in the spectacle enough for it not to be distracting.

I do have a few minor bugbears, but most of them did not impact my enjoyment. Not all the comedy banter works for me, some of the conflict between certain characters feels slightly forced, the Bruce Banner/Incredible Hulk issue feels contrived and the pace at times feels slightly rushed in order to give screen time for everyone.

All actors are great, particularly Josh Brolin's motion capture performance and voice work as Thanos. He really is the star of the show. Robert Downey Jr is funny and charismatic as ever. Chris Hemsworth's accent is poor as always, but his acting is good and has great chemistry with some of the other franchise characters.",8
I made an account just to review this movie.,29 April 2018,,10
Worth the long wait!,27 April 2018,"With all the hype and speculation making everyone wonder, what is really going to happen? I wasn't sure if the finished product would live up to the hype. I was totally wrong! If you like anything Marvel then this is a must watch. Be prepared to sit on he edge of your seat for 2 1/2 hours non stop.",10
Best movie ever!!!,29 April 2018,Simply the best movie I've ever seen!! Need to watch it at least 4 more times!,10
Masterfully crafted film about fighting spirit.,25 April 2018,"When was the last time you really wanted something? Now when you've pictured that moment in your mind; how much did you fight for it? Whatever that moment is for you, wether if it's a physical or mental. You pushed yourself through it, wether you succeeded or lost, you still fought for what you wanted. From the words of wise Mr. C; -""I don't need anything. I want."" That is the power that we as humans inhabit, what strive us forward. You fight for what you want, because you, alone believe that something should change. Our beliefs are our own personal superpower. Because no matter how hard the obstacle is. If you want to succeed. You will. If you don't believe me, read a book. This world was built by believers. By wanters. The mad Titan Thanos and the world's mightiest heroes themselves believe in this philosophy. The fundamental difference between these people are ideologies. And now here we are. Avengers: Infinity War. Believers against one powerful, unstoppable believer. Rejoice.

This is a superhero movie, that feels like a film. A well-crafted, emotionally resonant film that looks great, sounds great, acted great and has genuine thrills that will shock some. But entertain everyone. How much depends on how much you let yourself.",
Series finale,18 May 2018,"Last night I went to the cinema to watch ""Infinity War"" and I wasn't thrilled at all. I'm aware that it's partly my fault, but anyway I think it's extremely overrated. Seen by itself, the film is completely meaningless, because this is not a stand-alone film, but the grand finale of all Marvel films that precede it. So, it's not just recommended that you have seen most of Marvel films before, but it's absolutely necessary that you have seen them all and that they are fresh in your memory. I watched most of Marvel films, but some of them I skipped, and many of those I did see I saw too long ago to remember them, so ""Infinity War"" left me with the impression of a bunch of amazingly shot, but empty action scenes, without the story that gives this action a meaning. It's like if you watched the last hour of ""The Return of the King"", without previously watching the rest of the trilogy or reading ""The Lord of the Rings"" ever before. Most movies have a part that introduces you to characters, then introduces them into a story, then develops and elaborates the story, and ultimately takes you through the blow-away finale. This whole movie is one huge finale, while all the other elements that you need to experience this finale right way need to be found in other Marvel films. Each of the previous films brings new characters, introduces you to them and connects them to the characters from the previous films, builds their mutual relationships and portrays small parts of the big picture, and then ""Infinity War"" puts all these characters together and, assuming you already know who they are, what their relationships are and what was happening in their individual stories, it immediately cast you right into two and a half hour of action madness, without any characterization and explanations, and with a minimum of the story that serves just to separate the action scenes. Marvel films are a literally series in which the episodes are somewhat independent, and this is the last episode, and do not even try to watch it if you didn't follow entire series. Although visually excellent, to me ""Infinity War"" was terribly confusing and even boring, and I will refrain from rating it until I see all the movies that precede him, and then repeat it with good background.",7

"After all this time, I'm still trying to process this movie. To this day, it's still mind-blowing!",17 April 2019,"The 10 year build up of Marvel movies was definitely worth it, and certainly worth the hype. ""Avengers: Infinity War"" (2018), directed by Anthony and Joe Russo. Starring Robert Downey Jr., Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Evans, Josh Brolin, and many more! All I can say is, just like ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" (2014), this movie was mind-blowing. Mentally, I was not prepared for this masterpiece of a movie. I went in there with high hopes, and those hopes were exceeded. Everything ranging from the acting, the special effects, the story, etc. It was all first-rate (AND THEN SOME!) Now, one thing that can ruin a movie is annoying one-liners, or jokes. Marvel movies are full of them! However, this film keeps them to a minimum, which was very refreshing. They're finally realizing how unnecessary most one-liners are in their movies. What jokes they do have in ""Avengers: Infinity War"", are funny, and they are few and far between. It is a very well-balanced film from action, to comedy, and to drama. It was one of those rare experiences where a movie was so good, that the theater was silent during the whole movie. When that happens, you know you did a good job with your movie. I do have to confess something. A lot of you know that I didn't like the ""Black Panther"" (2018) movie, I also really hate the ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" movies, ""Ant-Man"" (2015), and the ""Doctor Strange"" (2016) movie. I was worried that those characters might ruin the movie, or be distracting. But, they were not bad at all. Like I said, Black Panther works better as a team player, and so does Doctor Strange and the Guardians of the Galaxy. In solo movies, those characters are dull, boring, cringeworthy and sometimes obnoxious! However, when they're part of a team, or playing side characters, they're not obnoxious at all. Also, since Ant-Man isn't in this movie, he's not a factor! Is this the best superhero movie? It's phenomenal, but there are some that I still personally like better. Is it the new best Marvel movie? Well, it's certainly in my top 5 on my Marvel Cinematic Universe ranking list! Overall, the cast is insane, but Josh Brolin as Thanos really steals the show. I will not spoil anything about this movie for you. You'll have to go see the movie to find out for yourself! Believe me, you won't be the same. If you think you know what this movie will be like from watching the trailers, you have no idea what you're in for! Props to you, Anthony and Joe Russo. You guys did a Marvel-ous job! I look forward to the sequel, and other future movies with your involvement. It's worth the money to buy on DVD, or to find some other method of watching it. Obviously, I give this film a full 5 out of 5 star rating, which equates to 10 out of 10 IMDB stars. If you haven't seen ""Avengers: Infinity War"" yet, what are you waiting for? You must check it out!",10
Not Truly The Infinity War (comic books) But Entertaining,19 July 2021,"The actual Infinity War was waged between The Magus, the ""dark side"" of Adam Warlock, who has the Infinity Gems in his possession in the comic books. No humans were harmed in this story in the comic books.

The movie is a Marvel invention, so one cannot even compare what it was in 1992 to an invention of Marvel's making for the knock-em-down-shoot-'em-up crowd who doesn't care about what the book was, but what entertains them.

In that respect, it is the equivalent of the 1966 Batman series of POW! BAM! CRUNCH! Titles. Constant action, enough so that no one cares that it is simply an action movie with Thor! Dr. Stange! The Hulk. Critically speaking, one barely has a moment to think. And that is the whole thing with this movie.

Thanos is entirely disappointing: he comes off as a Zen philospher instead of a raging, despotic murderer who has killed millions on other planets, and if you look back to the original Avengers movie, you might recall where Loki meets with a representative of Thanos who warns Loki that if he fails, ""My master will be very displeased"" or something along those lines. This Thanos fails to be the terrifying monster he has been for 1,000 years. He is simply ""the bad guy,"" and barely menacing.

As for The Avengers, they are competent enough, although losing every single battle (otherwise, there'd be no need for Part II).

As an action picture, it delivers. If you want an afternoon's entertainment, and action enough to send you back to the popcorn stand twice, this will do.

Asking for it to be intelligent is quite a stretch. But this was not Marvel's purpose, or they'd have made the ACTUAL Infinity War, not a dumbed-down version for those who also like the Fast/Furious type movies. Even the critics (who have probably never read a comic book in their life) were, for the most part, bowled over. (They like popcorn, too.)

Only the actual Marvel comic book fans know of the story that the movie could not begin to match. As one critic said, ""manage your expectations."" HE got it right. Not close to a 10, but there I go. Thinking will get you into trouble with this movie. My advice: DON'T.",6

One of best MCU Films,22 April 2024,"If only the film were better modulated, or perhaps longer, or more elegantly shaped, or ... well, it's hard to say exactly what's wrong here. But something's not up to snuff. This is, as many have pointed out, one half of a story broken in two, but it feels like less than half somehow. Until pretty recently, MCU films have suffered from collective curve-grading-each film seemed content to settle for ""better than expected,"" as opposed to being really, truly good-and that feeling returns here, unfortunately. ""Infinity War"" faced so many challenges, many of them unique to this particular project, that it's a small miracle that it works at all. On some level, it feels ungrateful to ask a movie that already does the impossible to do it with more panache. But what are superhero movies without panache really good for? If there was ever a moment to swing for the fences, it was this one.",9
Worst Hulk since?,13 August 2018,"Is it just me or Mark Ruffalo just came from downtown to shoot some scenes and went back to shoping. In some of the scenes he is holding himself barely to burst into laugh. Like shots were filmed without cuting anything with him. Really awkward performance, like he have nothing to act at all... Went too much funny and puns for his character. Thats just sums him up, rest of the movie is good, but expected more to be honest. There were many mistakes in CGI (in 20018), and saw better visuals two Avengers ago. Some part of story aren't logical and seems like there was many other ways to sort some plan/issue or whatever else. Not worst Marvel movie in past few years, far from best but at least killed 2 and half hours with it.",7

Cinematic Opulence !!,29 April 2018,"When Kevin Feige brought in Russo brothers to direct Captain America: The Winter Soldier, no one anticipated them to be handling the holy grail of Marvelverse, the Infinity War.

Synopsis: To balance the universe from desolation, Thanos aims to snuff away half of its lifeform, which he believes can be done if he yields all the six infinity stones viz., reality, time, power, space, soul & mind. However, his imposing plan gets stalled by earth's mightiest heroes 'The Avengers' & 'Guardians of Galaxy'.

What MCU had been lacking for so long, was a perfect villain. Loki did impose his mischief charisma in his earlier outings like in 'The Avengers' or 'Thor' but it never was as intimidating & terrifying as Josh Brolin's exhibition of Thanos. He not only nailed the character but demonstrated what a perfect nemesis can be, which not just dictates audience but admiration. Of course, his minions, the members of Black Order were no less daunting, look out for the character Ebony Maw flawlessly depicted by Tom Vaughan-Lawlor.

Kudos for putting in so many characters & yet making it perfectly balanced with coherent plot. Each member gets his & her share to shine. The action sequences were prodigious, something which we now are acquainted with & expect nothing short of spectacular from such franchise.

Infinity War has ventured into an uncharted path, where very few movies will ever dare to do; stakes were high for Anthony & Joe Russo, as it could have gone either way as it did with last year's Justice League. It took a decade of meticulous planning of interlaced stories to finally unleash the wrath of mad titan. Did it pay off? Hell yeah, what did you expect! Infinity War is not just a movie but a cinematic phenomenon, ready to awe & shock the reactionary followers of MCU franchise & general audiences alike. Be ready to be blown away.",9

Not too bad,19 May 2018,"Avengers: Infinity War packs quite a punch and after 10 years manages to tie together its universe.

This was a good film, it had strong points and it had disappointments as well. The fighting scenes and some touching moments were well done but at the same time the elements that have led Marvel produce some of the best superhero films were not there. Granted this was a more serious film but the humor was lacking. Captain America did not have his shield, the Avengers didn't fully unite but fought in different parts. Steve and Iron Man didn't even share a scene together. What might have been better could have been having those separate fights in other realms and later having the whole team fight together on Wakanda. To me the biggest issue was pace, Marvel films excel at having great space and making great use of their time. This film had a slow pace at the start and sadly a bit boring sometimes.

To me the film to beautifully tie their universe together was Civil War. This was a great film that devoted time to each hero, pitted them in a great match up and showed off their strengths. Don't get me wrong I enjoyed it but after all the hype I expected more. Pretty good but not great, other films such as Thor Rangarok, Spider Man and Ant Man hit it out of the park. Thanos was a great villain and Josh Brolin deserves praise. It was sad to see our heroes disappear but I am excited to see what's next. This was surely part 1 and part 2 will be the film that might live up and exceed expectations. It was realistic to have him win round 1 to make for an even great round 2.

Avengers: Infinity War, follows Thanos (Josh Brolin) and his quest to assemble the infinity gantlet to destroy half of a life throughout the universe as a fractured team of avengers, race to stop him. The characters are superb, the dynamic that each character brings to the table is fascinating and enjoyable, Marvel has taken a universe that they have been expanding on for the past 10 years and throws it on it's head. First time viewing this movie, I was on the edge of my seat and the second viewing was just as enjoyable being able to take in all the little details of the film. Well done to the Russo Brothers, the Actors and the Crew for making a cinematic event that lived up to my expectations. I highly recommend Avengers: Infinity War for any comic book fan, and super hero fan.",9

I forgot how good this was!,12 April 2020,,9
"Good movie ,could have been better",29 April 2018,"The movie is very good,sheathed the screenplay ,the effects or the battles ,but the movie concentrates more in talking Than actual movie,& also make the villain much vulnerable than we think ,the sound effects could have been used as it was like some Star Wars theme ,other wise the movie was great & also tempt us to think what will happen next,,,",7
"Thanos Rules in ""Infinity War""",29 April 2018,"The anticipation has been building for years. The ultimate baddie, Thanos, who has remained in the shadows, is coming to earth the get the five Infinity Stones that would give him the power to destroy half of the universe with one snap of his fingers. With the current Avengers disbanded, after the events of ""Age of Ultron"" and ""Civil War"", they weren't exactly prepared for a foe like Thanos. To avoid any spoilers, I will leave the plot details at that. ""Avengers: Infinity War"" really packs a punch. It's relentless action and quick (and often witty) dialogue keep the two and half hour movie rolling without slowing down for you to relax or, at times, really process what just happened. To balance all the Marvel Cinematic Universe characters, and subplots, was a feat in and of itself. I applaud the Russo Brothers (who also directed ""Winter Soldier"" and ""Civil War"") for taking on such a daunting task and succeeding in keeping us engaged while giving the primary Avengers, as well as The Guardians of the Galaxy, their own moments to shine. But this movie isn't really their movie. It's all Thanos, played by Josh Brolin buried under CGI to make him look more monster than man. But he finds a way to emote and make his character more than just another big baddie without a soul. The movie isn't perfect. There are a few CGI moments, mostly of Thanos, that looked like they needed more time to finish. And it's cliffhanger ending (the untitled ""part two"" will release May of next year) left me feeling numb and somewhat unsatisfied. But be sure to stay for the post-credits scene. It's worth the wait.",8
Thats why!!!,7 May 2018,,7
Waste,5 May 2018,"Such a waste of money, not mine, but 321 millions of dollars to make a movie like this? Not to mention the cast full of stars.

Alleatory, forced jokes,tiring.

I'm not huge fan of super hero's movies, but this one managed not to achieve my not to high expectation of a minimally interesting and engaging plot",3
One of the best Avengers movie,29 April 2021,"I think infinity war is one of the best Avengers movie. There is too much action, also I like development of characters. We can say too much about this movie but I am too lazy for this and I'm not eloquent person, so that's all what I can say:)",10
The hugest crossover of the cinema!,23 February 2019,"This movie is just perfect, all the drama, the action, the visual effects, the story, was amazing see all the heroes together, Thanos is the best villain and this is it. I can't wait for the next one!",10
"This Isn't About Hype, This Movie Is the New Standard For Blockbusters",30 April 2018,"How do you process a movie like Avengers: Infinity War?

As a fan of comic books and movies, I can safely say this was one of the most exceptional movie-going experiences of my life. Marvel not only matched my expectations for Infinity War, but they also exceeded it. Everything I thought I knew going in, would turn out to be wrong. Every prediction I made about life and death in this film-shattered. This is a movie that shouldn't work yet somehow it does. And what I mean by that is this: Avenger's: Infinity War raises the stakes to a crescendo and then walks away from it all without letting you fall gently. You are left to process your feelings, and Marvel doesn't care how you felt after it's over and done. That's bold. Secondly, no one...no one has ever been able to manage an ensemble quite like this. Reports are there are up to 70 Marvel characters in this film. Like seriously...who takes on this job as director? Well, thankfully it wasn't just one director. It was the powerhouse combo of Joe and Anthony Russo, and they deliver the best summer action flick in history! Hey James Cameron, as much as I admire your work, your opinion on Marvel movies sucks, and I pray they never end if they're going to make movies like this.

Thanos, the mysterious villain that has stalked post-credit scenes (and a Guardians movie) for years, arrives on the scene with some issues of his own. And in his mind, his destructive goals will ultimately save the universe from itself, despite the costs. Thanos argues for the indefensible: genocide as a cure for the battle for resources. He believes this will bring peace to the universe. Well apparently, our heroes will not stand for this, and it sets up the battle to stop him from gaining the last few Infinity Stones. I'm not a huge fan of CGI characters in a movie, but Thanos works-thanks to Josh Brolin's calm and confident portrayal of the sometimes sentimental madman.

This is a movie with some serious stakes, and that's hard to achieve in a film this weighty with characters because time devoted to dramatic impact is limited. But Marvel borrows the best of episodic TV and uses the emotional investment we already have with these characters to tear apart our heartstrings. In this film, the characters find themselves in unique pairings on separate missions, and wow...do these pairings work better than expected. Star-Lord, Dr. Strange, and Iron-Man. Let that sink in for a minute. Three of the most prominent egos in the Marvel universe--together. The interactions work better than imageable. The one-liners never cease, but it's never overly jokey. They know when to insert humor and when to get serious. And things get serious mid-way through thanks to some family drama. I was curious as to how well the Guardians would mess with our Earthbound heroes, but I got to say, that team delivers the heart to this CGI fest.

The characters in this film are all given moments to shine. We revisit the fantastic world of Wakanda, and it's more glorious than ever before as we get to see the city's defense systems. Captain America, Black Widow, Falcon, War Machine, Banner, and Bucky Barnes are all along for the ride, trying to protect Vision's infinity stone from Thanos. Hemsworth's Thor, without question, delivers one of the most crowd-pleasing entrances on film-judging by the roar from the crowd that was with me in attendance. And while it's hard to refer to any of our superheroes in this film as ancillary characters, know that the film focuses on three select groups of superheroes with each group having a few actors and actresses that claim more screen time than others. Scarlett Witch finally garners the screen time she deserves as the reluctant enhanced person with the power to save the world. Everyone and every action in this film have a purpose, which is why you care about the outcome of this film.

This is what blockbuster movies are supposed to be. This is why going to theaters are still more impactful than watching them at home on your television or handheld device. The Avengers: Infinity War takes you on an exhilarating emotional journey that will leave you exhausted, heartbroken and clamor for the next installment in the series.",10
A Great Movie With A Rollercoaster of Emotions - A Bang For Your Buck,28 April 2018,,10
superhero film of the year !!!,27 April 2018,One of the best superhero films I've watched !! Soooo recommended !!!,10
An unprecedented cinematic achievement!,21 October 2019,"Avengers: Infinity War is not a perfect movie, its not even a perfect superheroe movie... however there's no denying that balancing soo many characters in one movie is simply amazing! Almost all characters get to shine, Thanos is a brilliant villain with real emotions and motivations. The cgi and directing were great and the ending was amazing! Acting is solid as well but Tom Holland steals the show, especially towards the end of the movie! Only complaints i have are: very mediocre score, the Black Order was incredibly overhyped and all in all very disappointing, Banner not changing into the Hulk was ok from a certain standpoint and made narrative sense but it was preety disappointing, the battle of Wakanda wasn't as good as its Titan counterpart and Shuri is in this, I'm sorry but her character is so awful and annoying that i consider her mere existence to be a flaw. Anyways its only natural that a movie trying to balance 20 something different characters has a few flaws. It's funny (most jokes surprisingly enough land), atmospheric, it is not afraid to take risks, it brings out the best of most characters, it features a great villain and it's all in all better than it ever had the right to be! This movie gets an 8.5/10 from me (might have been a 9 if they didn't make Shuri outsmart Banner).",8
"Good, But Not Great",28 April 2018,,7
Expectations fullfilled and a new era began.,11 September 2018,"This movie is one of the best in a decade. Marvel started something magical and hyped it up to this point and did not disapoint. I read some reviews about the holes in the plot and et cetera and all i wanted to say was wtf are you talking about. These people probably didn't even watch a single marvel movie let alone a mcu movie. Let me tell you this: this movie has a plot as long as 18 movies. It's all scattered around the mcu movies. Seein the thing we have been expecting for a decade was the reward. Infinity War is great as a standalone movie but it's rewarding and more sensible if you watch other mcu movies. It's funny, action packed, emotional and heroic. It makes sometimes makes you cry out of laughing and sometimes out of sadness. I suggest you watch other mcu movies before seeing this movie and you will hype like a dog who has seen his owner ;).",10
By far the best from the Avenger series...,4 August 2018,"Dark with a lot of fighting, just like all the avengers movies should have been. Of course the classic humour was not missing and was just about the right amount to keep it a good action movie rather than a comedy like the last movie, end game.",7
Harry Potter and the deathly hollows,30 April 2018,"This is the worse film to date for marvel, too many plot holes, it was sold as an avengers movie should have just been infinity war, said every character was in it that was a lie, and was very much the same plot as the title that I have sub lined it.",1
Best Superhero movie period!!!,27 April 2018,"In my opinion this movie was what all Marvel fans wanted.Great action scenes,maybe the best villian,great story arc and great ending. I think that if someone likes marvel will love this movie like i did.",10
A MUST-WATCH FOR ALL MARVEL FANS,23 May 2019,"'Avengers : Infinity War' proves to be the best example of a cinematic culmination. The apex of 10-year storytelling delivers all we expected. It's a rare experience and has to been seen in 3D. Featuring 30 characters in just 2.5 hours sounds a bit complex and intricate, but I would say that the Russo Brothers have nailed the film. Watching all our favourite characters of the MCU in one film is just perfect and undoubtedly the most satisying part of the film. This film sets a new standard for the MCU. The team-up of Doctor Strange and Iron Man is hilarious and puts a huge smile on my face. But the most exciting team-up is that of Thor and the Guardians of the Galaxy. The biggest strength of the film lies in the Russo Brothers' ability to combine different storylines and franchises and form a riveting culmination. Josh Brolin's performance as Thanos manages to live up to what we expected. The plot twists involved in this film are unpredictable. You'd never see them coming. The characterization absolutely hits the mark and is well-planned and satisfying. The CGI and the action sequences stand out. The climax is jaw-dropping and epic and leaves you excited for the future events. Overall, 'Avengers: Infinity War' has achieved a significant position in the MCU and manages to live up to the hype.",9
Avengers: Infinity War,25 June 2021,"This was one of the best Marvel movies ever made. It is a truly amazing experience watching this movie. There were so many things this movie did well, but I will only talk about a few. The first thing I liked was how we got to see The Guardians of the Galaxy with some of the Avengers. We got to see Thor with the whole team. Later on, we saw Thor with just Rocket and Groot, then those three eventually United with the rest of the Avengers in Wakanda. We also got to see a comedic fight between Quill, Drax, Mantis, Iron Man, Spider-Man, and Doctor Strange. After some confusion, they realized they were on the same team and fought together against Thanos. I also liked the plot and story of this movie. I really liked how it was all about Thanos' quest to find the Infinity Stones, and all the different places he had to go. I liked how the story was written to have all the heroes we have been introduced to (except Scott and Clint due to their house arrest) in the movie, it was beautifully written. The writing did however cause for the Avengers to be split up the entire movie. I actually liked that because it had the Civil War feel to it with the two separate final battles. The Avengers are also still technically split up, so I though it worked out.

Like I said, this was an amazing movie, and an even better experience to watch it. This was definitely one of the best Marvel movies. I don't even need to recommend watching this movie, if you are a Marvel fan, you have watched it.",10
The MCU's Crowning Jewel,22 June 2020,"Infinity War is the pinnacle of the MCU. Out of the dozens of unique characters in the film, they managed to give each decent development. The atmosphere is perfect, displaying both the seriousness and darkness that Thanos brings while still including some good humor. Infinity War takes the action/comedy combo of the rest of the MCU but also manages to escalate the gravity of the situation. The moment Thanos sets foot on the screen, he is intimidating to audiences and heroes alike.

In the end, this almost seems like a film more about Thanos than about our heroes and is a refreshing approach. Definitely one of the best superhero films ever made.",10
Believe the Hype!,29 April 2018,"Going in to this film I was already a massive fan of the movies that had come before it. I had been introduced to characters I knew such as Captain America and Iron Man, characters I've never heard of like The Guardians of the Galaxy and reimagined characters in this cinematic universe such as Spider-Man. Though a couple of these films may have had flaws (Iron Man 2 for example) they have all been building up to this movie and my God have they pulled it off and more. This film is fantastic and easily one of the best if not best superhero movies released. I have been asked how it compares to Christopher Nolans 'The Dark Knight' and they are two different beasts. One is a superb crime drama with super hero elements and the other every comic book fans dream of a superhero mashup! From the first minute to the last your eyes are hooked, there is not one dull moment as it each fantastic action scene is filled between with tense moments. Each actor plays their roles to a level where you can't see anyone else being these characters. When Spider-Man appeared on screen I became I 10 year old kid again watching the cartoons, you are just swallowed by the film and when they film ended silence fell in my cinema except for a few gasps from the crowd, me personally I had no words for what I had just seen. I laughed at the funny moments, on edge of my seat at the dramatic ones and teared up when the film decided to go on an all out attack on my feels (one moment in particular killed me). All I know is when the film ends I said to a friend that the next film will make more than this one based on the fact you NEED to see the next film. One thing I did say is DC have the Joker Marvel have Thanos. I was absolutely blown away by the villain in this film and put him up there as one of the great movie villain in recent cinematic history, this film is more his movie than the avengers and I was impressed with how complex they made his character.

To close, there is hype and then there's this. It takes superhero movies to the next level and I love DC, but after this film it just showed that there is no competition anymore. There wasnt one to begin with either tbh. I will enjoy what DC bring to the table... but Marvel have that special recipe nailed. Believe the Hype and see this movie!!",10
MCU at its best. Had huge expectations and it completely delivered,29 December 2018,I've read the original comic book trilogy countless times as a kid and I was trying real hard to keep my expectations low for this movie so my inner super fan kid would not be disappointed. But it totally delivered and is a worthy culmination of what Marvel started with the first Iron Man movie.,10

Greatest Marvel Movie Ever Made!,27 April 2018,I loved this movie from start to finish! I can't wait to go see it again!,10
I walked out shook,27 April 2018,"First let me say that 10 years of emotions will be put into this film. From the first few minutes the intensity and tone of the film was lauded out. Prepare for deaths and all sorts of confusion. The cgi was fantastic the story really did feel like the end. Thanos was worth the six year wait it was absolutely phenomenal. Prepare for surprises, your typical MCU jokes but most importantly the tone felt like the end of an era. The action seemed more violent like they knew the stakes and the ending of this film may be the best movie ending ever. I never cry and I sobbed three times in this film. Prepare for this epic conclusion. I'm still shaking, even an hour after seeing it.",10
That Was Pretty Amazing,29 April 2018,"Wow. I left Avengers: Infinity War SHOOK. The Russo Brothers did it, it's probably one of the best Marvel Movies. Avengers: Infinity War is one of the few movies that made me wanting to see it TWICE. The tone of the movie is very dark, it's an intense movie and deserves to be seen in IMAX 3D, the format I saw it in. This movie blew me away, the music is epic and gorgeous, the CGI is fantastic, Josh Brolin is also fantastic as Thanos, he is very evil but also has something behind him. It's a great movie, I highly recommend it.",10
To Infinity and Beyond,29 April 2018,This movie went above and beyond all of my hopes and dreams for the MCU. Everything you'd want in a Marvel superhero film and then some. The humour was perfectly timed and placed and the writing and pace of the movie was phenomenal.,10
Expect the unexpected,20 May 2019,"I want to give an expanded review but I'm in shocked. I don't even know what to say anymore. This was so great, beyond great actually. You better watch it yourself and you'll see.",10
Best of all the avengers.,19 September 2020,Only avengers movie that I actually enjoyed. All the other ones are garbage. Still don't get how its rated so high ?,7
Top to Bottom,29 April 2018,From the moment it starts you are on the tip of your seat. Every scene is critical and are non-fillers. Thanos packs a punch and all the Avengers catch a piece of it. So much happened it's worth a second trip to the movies.,10
Binding,27 June 2018,"When you watching the movie, time past very fast but there are a lot of script errors.",7
Flaming hot garbage,24 June 2018,"A bloated smorgasbord of uninteresting protagonists (save Iron Man) fighting an oaf with magic crystals. Not to mention, an overzealous color pallete and use of CGI that left me longing to stare into a dark, bottomless pit for hours. The obligatory Marvel laugh lines were embarrassingly stale, though inexplicably humorous to the audience. From the cheap moments of social awkwardness or the annoying insecurity of Quill vis a vis Thor, I found myself constantly groaning. I say all this recognizing Justice League was also hot garbage, but at least a few of the characters were interesting. Oh how I miss those halcyon days of Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy - where the drama prevailed and the characters were worth caring for. Batman v. Superman had it's flaws (Martha!) but at least it's got heart! I found myself checking my watch less than an hour into Infinity War. This crossover was indeed too ambitious.",1
Great movie,30 April 2018,,10
AMAZING ONE OF THE BEST FILMS EVER,7 May 2018,"Delivers on the hype, wasn't predictable to your usual MCU films with the best MCU Villain to date with a really well written story and up there with the best villains ever and that ending is one of the best endings ever.",10

Great film,26 April 2018,Amazing.... so many twists and turns and as funny as ever...why isn't it 2019 already!,10
Epic and emotional,18 December 2018,"Avengers: Infinity War is Marvel's best film to date, balancing humour, action and emotion surprisingly effectively. It's also surprisingly well paced allowing all of it's incredible cast to have at least one memorable moment. The direction from Joe and Anthony Russo is incredible. The music by Alan Silvestri is incredible. The CG and action is phenomenal and undoubtedly some of Marvel's best. Surprisingly, Thanos has a really good amount of depth and Josh Brolin gives an incredible performance. All the Avengers are great but Robert Downey Jr. and Chris Hemsworth give the standout performances. The script is amazing, both bold and unpredictable.",10
The good guys looks and sounds idiot,11 May 2020,"Too many idiot chars this time. Stark's sarcasm is now dump and not funny and smart anymore, Spiderman forced jokes got under my skin, and Peter Quill looks just demented and not over the top.

Superhero's have overstayed their welcome,27 April 2018,Maybe I'm just sick of superhero movies.

"Breaks the ""Spider-Man 3"" and ""Dawn of Justice"" curse",30 March 2020,"I was a bit worried about this film. Yes, Marvel is nearly perfect, but I was also worried that we would have another ""Spider-Man 3"" or ""Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice"" situation where it's too overstuffed with characters that it becomes hard to follow. This is not the case. It does jump around from place to place frequently, and I wish the plot had flowed better, but I was still able to follow what was going on. This has possibly the best villain in all of the MCU! Thanos is the Darth Vader of this franchise! He's the villain you love to hate and are genuinely afraid of. The actors bounce off of each other very well and the dialogue is as fast-paced and witty as we've come to expect from Marvel. While at times, it does feel like watching a bunch of video game cutscenes edited together, the movie is so enthralling that my first reaction to the credits (other than pure surprise for reasons I don't dare spoil) was ""It's over already?! It just started 20 minutes ago? What? It started almost 3 hours ago?! How is that possible?"" That's how much this film pulled me in! It's well worth the 10 year wait! It's amazing to see all these characters interact with each other! There are some really amazing shots and moments, which again, I won't spoil. There's a reason Marvel was unusually secretive with this film. Other than the story not flowing as well as it should have, there isn't anything to complain about with this film. Grade: A- 9/10 4/5 stars",9
GOOD,6 April 2020,"Been the best out of all the other Marvel antagonists. It shows his personal conflicts, his purpose, as well as his cruelty.",9
Best movie ever,29 April 2018,All types of twists in this movie. And stay for the after credits awesome.,10
Completely changed the game,30 April 2018,"Everyone thought that the first Avengers movie was something else. People thought that it was the best it was going to get. They were so amazed at the idea of a team up that contained not only one but many of the characters that they know and love. But now, Marvel expanded further. Now not only different characters were brought together, but different universes. This truly was a movie for everyone. I am amazed at how well Marvel brought together these different superheroes to defeat the same enemy.",10
Everything I expected,29 April 2018,"I worried if in my mind, hyped this movie up too much. But it was the movie I needed! Brilliant ... fingers crossed the sequel removes all the damage Thanos has inflicted on the universe!",10
Ten years,8 January 2019,I as a fan I would give it a 10 But as a critic I give it a 9 It has the emotional effect after all this years of the MCU Story is perfect. The antagonist is perfect. Finally we have an end But just the half of it Cause we have to wait for the second part in 2019,7
"Best villan ever, best plot",29 April 2018,Please watch. At least twice. Everyone get their reason and motivation explained. Every plot is meaningful. Everyone in the theater was shocked and moved. I know it's weird but I kind of respect Thanos after watching for the second time.,10

Awesome,29 April 2018,,10
"Far and away, the best Avengers movie",10 July 2021,"I don't like the Avengers. Captain America is a pain in the neck and the actor is just bad. The first Iron Man was good but the sequels were embarrassing.

Apart from Iron Man and the 2 Guardians of the Galaxy, the MCU movies are just boring imo. I don't count the Deadpool movies in the MCU (they're Ryan Reynolds movies! ^^).

And apart from Infinity War. Not for the heroes. They aren't really better or more interesting. But Thanos is the first interesting character created by that franchise. Really good!

Since it's still MCU, they justed wasted their best creation in Endgame which was so disappointing, again imo.

But Infinity War is very good.",9
Best movie,4 April 2019,It will not be better than that ... awesome. The best movie I've ever seen,10
THE BEST!,27 April 2018,"Dare I say Thanos has beaten out The Joker for best villain in a ""comic book"" movie; He is unapologetically ruthless. From the very beginning to end, I was on the edge of my seat. Marvel truly did not hold back with this gem*no pun intended* This is a must see! I just don't know how you can top it!",10
More than what I expected,28 April 2018,"This is saying a lot considering I'd hyped it up all the week prior by rewatching the last 18 Marvel movies, and I was still shell shocked. This movie took my expectations and obliterated them, it's a nigh perfect culmination of subplots and characters like I never would've expected, and the ending... truly gripped me. If you haven't seen the prior MCU movies I would not recommend watching this one yet simply because you'd have very little time for character development with each character; there's a reason for the 18 movies prior. However, if you're a Marvel fan, or even someone that's just caught up on the MCU movies and not necessarily a die hard fan, you can safely go in with high expectations, as the unprecedented ending and plot will leave you shaken with surprise.

Note: I would largely ignore the negative reviews if they mention 'compared to DC' or anything about DC, as the rivalry between DC and Marvel has made DC fans incredibly angry and jealous to say the least. To say the least they will negatively review the movie regardless of the actual movie itself if it falls under the Marvel name.",9
Great Storyline. Great Acting. Intense cliffhanger. I was left emotionally distraught.,29 April 2018,"Emotions run high throughout. Marvel has made it possible for me to feel sympathy for Thanos during this film, however it has been made clear the importance of every actor, but in my personal opinion how important Spider-Man (Tom Holland) whose acting was beyond phenomenal, I was almost brought to tears because of the superb quality of acting that he (Tom) provided. Overall this movie ends on a note of pure anticipation for next year! If you can't handle anticipation well, I recommend viewing this movie later. Although in my opinion it was well worth the wait.",9
Not That Good,28 April 2018,I don't review much but after watching Avengers : Infinity War thought to write something. So many avengers i feel could not justify every one of them. Movie is decent but they have done cheap trick and incomplete ending. Not impressed.,7
The perfect superhero movie,29 April 2018,"This movie was really a good one. It had almost everything emotion, fun and some or I will say many unexpected things related to the death of superhero's or stones location. This movie deserves 9/10 and it is a movie which you will feel to watch 2-3 more times.",9

Not Worth Your Money Nor The Hype,30 April 2018,,1
An absolutely amazing movie that puts ever other MCU movie to shame!,29 April 2018,"Ever since Iron Man premiered in 2008, the MCU has been building up to this point, through thick and thin, through highs and lows, Infinity War was the climax of an encapsulating film franchise. Just saw the film, and I was absolutely blown away.

This film is engaging, hilarious, suspenseful, emotional, and absolutely entertaining from beginning to end. It'll shock you, make you laugh, make you gasp, and make you tear up. Never in any movie has this big of a cast been so well utilized, with great chemistry and a great amount of character-driven humor.

By far the best character in the movie was Thanos. With every tease and cameo in other MCU films, Thanos was built up as the greatest villain the heroes would ever face. He is menacing, commands a intimidating presence, and has an arc that makes him a complete and believable character among the others. Josh Brolin provided us with absolutely the greatest villain of the MCU.

The stakes are high with the infinity stones as Thanos attempts to collect them all. With stakes as high as these, characters are sure to die! Not in the typical comic book film way, but as emotional and heart-breaking moments (No spoilers on who actually dies!)

The Russo Brothers outdid themselves, continuing the MCU's unparalleled success of making engaging and entertaining flicks. Infinity War is by far the best of the MCU, proving once and for all, that comic book movies are here to stay for a very long time. Avengers Infinity War is incredible, absolutely at 10/10 film! (No spoilers in my review! Your welcome!)",10
10/10 A Spectacular Achievment in Film,27 April 2018,"Avengers Infinity War lives up to the hype in all possible ways. From beginning to end, I didn't know whether to cheer or cry.",9
Incredible!,29 April 2018,MCU has been out for about 10 years and the fact that Avengers Infinity War consolidates all those years is just absolutely insane! This movie is one of the most amazing movies in the MCU and we are able to see all this mixture of characters that connect each other and brings back all those past memories ever since the release of Iron Man.,10
Simply incredible.,29 April 2018,"Loved every scene of this movie. Great comedy, rollercoaster of emotions and an unbelievable cliffhanger at the end!",10
The BEST movie of all time!!,27 April 2018,,10
"Endgame is Boring, but This is Not",12 October 2019,"I love this! I like the plot, the actions, the casts. When I watched this one, I was expecting something big, spectacular as the closing of Avanger series. Unfortunately when Endgame was released (I queued on line and got uncomfy seat in the cinema because so many people wanted to see it), I disappointed with that. Now, I'm remembering this film and comparing it with previous Avenger series, if I can give score and review this, I'll put rate 9 for this one and 6 for Endgame. I still remember the actions and storyline in Infinity Stone, but all I can remember about Endgame is just about the first 30 minutes in boring conversation film.",9
It was good,26 September 2023,"""Avengers: Infinity War"" assembles the Marvel universe with my 7/10 rating, and I must say, I liked it. The acting, bolstered by a star-studded cast, shines as each hero grapples with the impending threat of Thanos. The film editing skillfully juggles multiple storylines, creating a relentless pace of action and emotion. Its strength lies in its portrayal of the cost of heroism and the weight of sacrifice, delivering a message that heroes are defined by their choices. The music, with Alan Silvestri's iconic theme, elevates the grandeur of the battles, and the cinematography captures the vastness of the Marvel cosmos. ""Infinity War"" is an epic culmination of a decade of storytelling, an emotional rollercoaster that left us eagerly awaiting the endgame.",7
Simply incredible,29 April 2018,"This is the strongest movie in a cinematic universe full of great films. As the title says, it is simply incredible, a must see.",10
... but this... does put a smile on my face!,8 May 2018,"First of all: I found A:IW to be entertaining. It's worth the watch let alone for the comedy and the fight scenes.

Now the bad: it tries to be a lot of things at once: a comedy, a drama and an apocalyptic action movie - and it fails to properly deliver any one of those. It achieves to be a comedy in parts, especially the Guardians' scenes are VERY funny (at least if you like their WTF-humour). The dramatic part, unfortunately, falls flat. Thanos has a lot of potential to be a tragic character, but his background story, motivation and character traits are given barely a handful of scenes. I think 'generic' is not the correct word for him, but he's also definitely not a deep character. The action is ok, actually very much the stuff you would expect. Apocalyptic or epic atmosphere is missing - people on earth simply don't seem to care a lot about Thanos' invasion. Also, the fights of Avengers and their allies versus Thanos' forces takes place on a very small scale - you will see what I mean. Personally, I also didn't like the joking around and the 'cool' attitude of the heroes in the face of universal extinction, it just was another atmosphere killer to me. It should have been either all comedy or all serious.

Oh and I loved the ending! So calm and peaceful, yet so significant and brutally uncompromising. I hope they don't just revert it in the sequel (and it's aaaaall marshmallows again) :-/

That might sound very harsh, but the bottom line is: A:IW is an entertaining action spectacle. 7 stars: 2 for the action, 2 for the jokes, 2 for the villain with potential, 2 for the artistic ending, 1 for the timetravel-multiple-realities-story, -1 for the nonexistent epicness and -1 for the story arc with the dwarf (completely wasted screentime).",7

I loved it- except for one thing,27 April 2018,,10
"Avengers: Infinity War - review, 9/10",29 April 2018,"There's little explanation needed for this movie, the incredible hype that this movie has generated is testament to that; however, if you really are coming into this movie with no clue as to what it is, firstly how big a rock are you under? Secondly, I would advise you turn back for now. This film is a culmination of the wider Marvel Cinematic Universe that has been developing for the past decade and it would be a waste to walk in to the theatre without previously immersing yourself into it. I know it sounds arduous but I truly feel that to fully appreciate what this movie has done, you need to familiarise yourself with the rest of the cinematic universe. So go, look up a viewing guide to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, buy a shedload of DVDs and set aside about 30 hours (phew!) of your time before you return.

I'm assuming that I'm dealing with those of you that are familiar with the films at this point, and have no fear, there are no spoilers to be found here so you can read on without worry. There'll be those of you that have been swept up in the whirlwind of hype of Infinity War, and there will be those who are sceptical of the seemingly incredulous speeds that this whirlwind is reaching, I'll tell you now that I was a member of the latter group; the expectations for this movie were astronomical, but, against all odds, they were met. To my surprise, Avengers: Infinity War hit every note for me, the acting, the absolutely gorgeous spectacle (including some of the most riveting and inventive action sequences I have ever seen), meticulous and outrageous action, and the now-trademark Marvel comedy, it is not without mistakes but it hits when it counts and evidences a maturation of the wider cinematic universe, shedding the mistakes of the past in favour of a newer, realer tone that breaks free of the classic Marvel-mould.

The two key issues I had found with previous entries were the poor execution of the main villains (think Thor: The Dark World) and the incessant comedic undercutting of sincere scenes (think Ragnarok). If these failures were keeping you anxious for this movie, know that they are largely fixed, the comedic tone is still finding that balance but is well-dispensed for the majority of the movie (and is nowhere near as distracting as it was in Ragnarok). The sincerity of this movie is well-used and certain scenes had left me a little misty-eyed, the raw emotion in this film was a welcome surprise. The second gripe, development of the main villains, is the greatest success of this movie, a great deal of time is put into ensuring that the stereotypical big-bad isn't just a stereotypical big-bad, instead his perspective is presented to you in an almost sympathetic way; perhaps you won't agree with his aims, but you understand them, and that's a first for the Marvel movies and is something that should be celebrated because it was achieved with great success.

Infinity War has accomplished a fantastic feat in the biggest crossover event in cinematic history, almost all of your favourite heroes will all feature here, all given respectable screen-time in their own subplots (of which there are many) before crossing paths with each other. It is a joy to see the immense cast that Marvel have been building for the past 10 years quip and bicker together as they face almost impossible odds as one. This summer blockbuster of epic proportions is not one to be missed and is a love-letter to the hordes of fans who have persevered since the beginning of Marvel-mania in 2008.",9

The film that has everything that was missing from the other Marvel movies,29 April 2018,"10 years, 19 films, 15 billion dollars and a huge fanbase composed of an extremely homogeneous audience of women, men, children, teenagers, adults and the elderly; In short, Marvel with its MCU has created an unprecedented film phenomenon that seems not to want to decrease but instead does nothing but expand more and more from year to year, especially in the American and world box office where it continues to break records on records so much to create almost an economic monopoly while the DC counterpart, as much as I appreciate it, remains helpless to look with great envy. All this immense work to get to this point, to get to this huge, impressive and epic, as well as exciting, dark and, however difficult it may seem, even deep film; all this to get to ""Avengers: Infinity War"". A waited film, as already mentioned, for ten years and a huge number of fans and not only, which had the task of being able to bring together all the Marvel superheroes so far cinematically known, to link the various films, to give a species of conclusion, which will then be more concretized in the fourth, to this complex scheme that is the expanded Marvel universe, and above all to succeed, at least, to satisfy the great expectations that have grown together with this universe. To do all this, Joss When, after creating ""Avengers"" and ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"", is replaced by two brothers, Joe and Anthony Russo, former directors of the last two chapters of the trilogy dedicated to Steve Rogers aka Captain America, ""Captain America: the Winter Soldier"" and ""Captain America: Civil War. The two directors have managed to give the film a heart and a soul, you can perceive in each frame, sequence and dialogue the love on their part and of each of the actors in the film that have invested in this project and, above all in this movie. They also managed to give to Infinity War probably what really distinguished this to all the other Marvel films, that is an almost perfect villain, Thanos, a villain who does not believe in his ego to be such because he is motivated by a real, tangible and understandable motivation, a villain who is able to experience feelings beyond anger and desire for destruction, a villain with whom the spectator almost manages to tie because as immoral and ruthless as he may be it is also almost understandable, a villain that has not only the characteristic to be such but that has different facets, different nuances and different reasons that push he, almost against his will, to be such, in short an extremely complex villain, characterized in an exemplary manner and that marks a real strength and turn to the internal of the MCU; if there is something missing in each of the previous films that are part of this universe is the presence of a great bad guy, absolutely not flat or forgettable but that proves a real challenge for heroes protagonists. It is also interpreted with great credibility by an extraordinary Josh Brolin, which we will see soon also in the role of Cable in the sequel to Deadpool, who immerses himself totally in the character and manages to be worthy of his intense and really complicated role. The Russo also impress the audience with a balanced and well calibrated alternation of ironic moments with others darker, of moments more emotional and moving with others more sensational and with a strong visual impact. They also succeeded in giving the right time to each character, perhaps one of the most difficult tasks given the large number of them and the duration of ""just"" two and a half hours. Basically they managed to make a film not difficult to work, almost impossible to achieve, they did a job that will enter, if it has not already done, in the history of cinema, which will be studied in film schools and will act as an example for many others movie. Nothing of this film is not in the right place or does not work, especially if considered the technical aspect that really turns out to be a real triumph: extraordinary special effects, extremely credible and realistic despite their abundant amount, especially in the realization of Thanos give the best of themselves; a direction, as already said, impeccable; an extremely suggestive and exciting cinematography, with truly sensational colors; an incisive, noisy, perfectly contextualized soundtrack that gives the right tone and the right atmosphere to the whole film; and a perfect editing in every sequence. An unforgettable film, impossible for a fan to see objectively because it touches the emotions that have formed over the past ten years, an immense, extreme, epic film and I could continue for many lines giving it the best compliments for a blockbusters of this size. But above all for me is a film that has managed to awaken in me that great fan who grew up with this universe and that in recent films was lost because demoralized by the repetition and the stalemate created inside the MCU, they aren't bad movies, especially the last ""Black Panther"" but that were beginning to repeat itself in the structure and in the plot. So I can only be more than happy with this ""Avengers: Infinity War"", a film that has everything that was missing in the other Marvel movies.",9
I had high expectations. They were not let down.,29 April 2018,"The movie had a good balance between comedy and plot, and the plot was very good. Without giving anything away, the movie is marvel through and through, and yet so much more! Definitely worth the watch",10
Game of 2 halves,6 October 2018,"Infinity War is a wildly ambitious and entertaining ride. For the first 90 minutes it pulls it off. However i was bored in the last 60 minutes.

It's very funny, and many of the characters are on good form. Thanos is an intimidating villain, cunning and cruel. But like so often with Marvel he does come up short. And blink and you'll miss Black Panther, bar the fantastic Wakanda battle,

Everyone floats away at the end, and it will do likewise in my memory.",6

Since the first Avengers, everyone has wanted to see Thanos face the Avengers and boy does he. Everything about this movie is what people love about the MCU. The directors did a great job mixing the comedy, action, and drama together and pushing the story the whole time. This is a movie you'll want to see again right after it is over, at least for me it is!",10
Greatest Marvel film of all time,27 April 2018,"This film nailed every aspect, - comedy, action, plot. Everything was perfect. The way they built up the final battle was truly significant and with all marvel films, the CGI and cinematography was truly ahead of its time. A truly magnificent masterpiece of a film",10
A breath of fresh air for the MCU,29 April 2018,"Over the last 10 years, Marvel Studios has built their own cinematic universe through various movies, each one getting bigger and bigger and leading up to this very movie, ""Avengers: Infinity War"". It's a movie that was essentially 10 years in the making, and with all the buildup and hype through the years, the question remains: Does it live up to the hype and meet expectations? Not only does Infinity War do both, it also manages to be a breath of fresh air into the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

What Marvel has done with their cinematic universe over the past decade is nothing short of astounding. To be able to produce as many movies as they have and still keep the attention of the fans is a true example of good storytelling. The culmination of this good storytelling comes in the form of Infinity War, directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, which takes place after the events of 2016's ""Captain America: Civil War"", also directed by the Russo's. After their big fight with each other in that movie, the Avengers became a fractured, divided group. Some have even gone into hiding. However, they must put their differences aside for the sake of the universe when they learn of Thanos (Josh Brolin), who is seeking to collect the six infinity stones to have the power to wipe out half the universe, which he claims will bring balance to the universe. On the surface it seems like the typical Marvel superhero story, but there's something different here. This is darker and more bleak than pretty much any other Marvel movie. It goes places you wouldn't expect a Marvel movie to go to, and by doing so it feels unlike any other Marvel story before it. It also does a good job with keeping the viewer guessing what's coming next, and there are some twists and turns that leave the viewer always anticipating the next turn of events. In short, it's unpredictable, even all the way to its shocking ending. It's certainly a breath of fresh air when compared to the more traditional and predictable stories they have done recently. Kudos to Marvel for pulling all of this off.

What's interesting about Infinity War is that while it is the biggest Marvel movie ever in terms of the amount of characters and its sheer scale, its story is a more personal one that also has its fair share of emotional moments. Many of the more personal and emotional moments involve the villain, Thanos, which was a smart move because it gives the viewer insight on why he does what he does and the sacrifices he has to make to accomplish what he sets out to do. It establishes him as more of a complex, fleshed-out character instead of just some big, dumb bad guy that's in it to cause havoc. It's what makes Thanos easily the best MCU villain yet. The writing team of Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely deserve major props for this.

Although the story is dark, the movie has its fair share of humor that helps lighten the mood. While it's good to have humor, it can be a bad thing when there's too much of it at the wrong times, which tends to happen in Infinity War. There are a good amount of scenes, especially in the first half of the movie, where the humor would get in the way of the drama, which ended up getting a bit annoying because it would take away from the dramatic tension. The comedic scenes also tended to last a bit too long and drag on, especially during one scene involving the Guardians of the Galaxy and Thor. It was an issue early on, but fortunately got better as the movie went on.

As usual, the cast is great, with basically everyone returning from the previous movies. Whether it's Evans, Downey, Johansson, Hemsworth, Ruffalo, etc., it's always a joy to see these actors having fun with one another, and it helps that they have great chemistry with each other. Josh Brolin is also very good as Thanos through motion capture and voice over, and he helps make Thanos not only an intimidating villain, but just an all around good villain.

In short, Avengers: Infinity War is a thrilling and unpredictable journey that not only adds to Marvel's continuing success at the movies, but also raises the bar for the Marvel Cinematic Universe. If Infinity War is any sign of what's to come from Marvel in the future, then I can't wait to see what they have in store for us. Bring it on!",9
A much better film than Endgame,28 November 2019,"Avengers: Infinity War was clearly much better than Avengers: Endgame in the sense that 1) it was better in terms of writing, 2) it is the true culmination of an entire decade of MCU films, and 3) Endgame gave me more questions than answers.",7
Great Movie 🍿,14 July 2021,,10
"Better Than Past MCU Films, But Still Has Almost the Same Formula",28 April 2018,"Avengers: Infinity War comes after a long line of previous Marvel films, and some would say that the same old formula is getting pretty exhausting. Infinity War definitely has a lot of the same formula, and still plays it safe at times, but it is definitely a step up from a lot of the previous films. Doesn't say as much as Black Panther, but still has some philosophical moments. This film also has a villain a tad more interesting than most of the bland MCU films in previous entries, and we get to understand a bit more of how he thinks. He is a bit more complex than most of the previous villains, and that is refreshing. Avengers: Infinity War was a pretty good film, not amazing, but a decent enough Marvel film in a time when its formula has been getting pretty tiring.",7

Such a colorful movie..,4 April 2019,"I am a big Marvel fan and this movie is just so fascinating for me. I am amazed how CGI has progressed for all these years. I'll try to write this review with as little spoilers as I can so let's go. What I particularly was the beginning of the movie. The beginning of ""Infinity War"" is so dark and the start is so shocking and just unbelievable for me to process everything so fast. The scenes are so unpredictable and it left me open-mouthed for the rest of the movie. The dark blue color prevails over every single scene and the actors did their job so perfectly. Later in the movie, the colors start changing, from blue to red, to rainbow-ish and dark ones again. The scenes start changing quickly as the fight scenes start appearing and it is just not explainable how I felt while watching. The background music is just perfect. Alan Silvestri may be one of the best composers and I am so proud of what he did on the movie. The ending just left me speechless as it may have left you, those are some heavy scenes for viewers and the whole cinema was basically sniffing and some were even crying. To conclude, the movie has a great number of funny scenes and I would definitely recommend it for every single movie lover.",9
Best Best Best Movie ever,27 April 2018,Awesome movie full of action fun no words love you MCU,10
GOING TO NEED A THERAPIST NOW!!!,29 April 2018,"So I'm not going to review infinity war into great detail, since as I'm writing this there's over 850 reviews, in a span of the movie being out for only 3 days, but I will say I'm a huge MARVEL fan. Bigger than you believe. The movie was near perfect. Probably ranked in my top 3 favorite comic book movies of all time. It was an emotional roller coaster, and it made me cry. And that's saying something since Logan didn't even make me cry. The visuals are amazing, The Black Order was amazing, one of the best part of the film. It's also crazy how much character development Thanos had in one film. The Russo brothers actually made me love him. And to conclude my review, I walked into the theater paying 20$ and walked out having to pay 300$ a week. If someone can send me Marvel's address and everything so I can bill them for my therapy sessions that would be great :) one more thing I would like everyone to stand 2 minutes in silence for our fallen cinematic universe; The DCEU, may they rest in peace.",10
Good movie technically. Action part a bit less.,29 April 2018,"Avengers infinity waa is good watch film.. And the super heroes demise was sad.. we miss them.

Astonishingly good film,29 April 2018,,9
Entertaining if you're in the mood,26 August 2018,"Sometimes you just want to hang in the couch and watch something and not think too much. Just be entertained and relax. Well, this movie isn't that relaxing. Lots of action, fighting, fast dialogue, many characters and change of locations. A dwarf, a racoon, a black panther, a spiderman, a robot, aliens and hulks. And all have some kind of supernatural power. Great kids stuff. Quality of acting or character development are not really main aims here. Effects, animations and stunts are really good. So, turn your mind off, grab some popcorn and enjoy. An hour after viewing you'll have forgotten you've seen it.",6
All around good movie,30 April 2018,"Are there plot holes and/or issues with the movie, yes. However, for the amount of characters and things going on in this movie, they did a great job making a coherent good movie.

The best movie of all time,3 April 2019,"This movie is my most anticipated movie for 3 years, and when I sit on the cinema, it feels like this is the time that I wait for a long time. And when I came out from the cinema, I feel like I want to watch this movie for a thousand times. And what's the best in this movie is the visual effects. I'm really proud the Industial light&Magic, Weta Digital, CineSite, Framestore, Digital Domain, and more... This movie deserve the best visual effects awards",10
"Packed with action, humor, and high emotional stakes",29 April 2018,"A cinematic crossover event unprecedented in its action, humor and melodrama, ""Avengers: Infinity War"" is an ambitious addition to the MCU in the same way ""Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back"" (1980) or ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 1"" (2010) were for their own series. The film somehow manages to coherently smash together a multitude of heroes and produce compelling, non-stop entertainment with high emotional stakes. There are minor frustrations with some characters needing more screen time, but ""Avengers: Infinity War"" accomplishes its goals as the first entry in an epic two-part installment. 9/10 or A-",9
10 out of 10 You can't change my mind it's nearly perfect. Just needed to be longer,27 April 2018,First off 10/10 it's also probably the first and last 10/10 ratings I will ever give a movie. I don't hand 10s out like candy it has to be better then good this review while most haven't watched it contains no real spoilers as of yet. Here we go with some notes you gotta stay for the ending scene after credits that combined with Dr. Strange and Tony convo you need to pay attention to what they are talking about it has everything to do with the way the movie ends. It's not the ending and the end scene with fury the message is sent to alert someone we haven't seen in marvel movies yet. There were very little mistakes if any maybe gripes or people who don't understand or follow everything cause they don't read comics or watch marvel movies. The action in the movie is well thought out and top notch so are the jokes. This movie is meant to play on your emotions leave you guessing even though the movie is pretty complete on it's own. Some people gripe the CGI was sketchy at parts. I would disagree but also if you payed for 3D I bet it would be a lot better then you think. I may go see it again just for that reason this is a good movie to see in 3d. Yes people die it is meant to show how strong Thanos is he already has 1 stone at the very beginning of the movie so that adds to his strength. Thanos and the man who played him (Josh Brolin) is as good as any joker or guy who played him dead or alive. All of the people who played hero's were top notch even if they never play in another movie again this movie is enough to polish any résumé. It's not a money grab it's a masterpiece. A true Marvel. Go see it.,10
Simply Phenomenal!,28 April 2018,"This movie is marvel at its absolute best. It strikes a perfect balance between humor and tensions. The last moments in the movie left myself and the entire theatre absolutely speechless. I was in tears during many parts of this film. Josh Brolin gives a fantastic and entrancing performance as Thanos. I found my attention consistently captured on Thanos in every scene he is in. Chris Evans, Robert Downy Jr. and Chris Hemsworth gave phenomenal performances as well. The entire cast was at their best. However, Tom Holland was the one whose performance moved me the most to tears. Overall, this movie is amazing. The pacing and story are balanced perfectly (as all things should be) and cast is inamitable. This movie is one for the history books.",10
Easily MCU's best!,19 May 2019,"This is one of those Movies that you can watch from start to end and not get bored at all! Endgame wasn't even this good. Everything is great from Visuals, Music and Story. I can watch this once A week and never be bored by it. A very rare masterpiece.",10
Just awesome!,29 April 2018,Don't ask anyone about the movie before you see it!,9
A Good Film That Nevertheless Has Some Problems.,19 May 2018,"Avengers:Infinity War is a film that has a problem. A huge problem. Namely, how to encompass 10 years of screen history and 23 characters into one film so, that the end result would not take over three hours to complete, and not only be satisfying, but also good? It is hard, so the writers and the directors should be honored for having made a film as good as they did. There is also a great moral dilemma at the center, namely that of whether it is right to kill some in order that the many could have a better life? In that case, the films is really amazing, and also a great example of entertainment cinema. But. The films is not that good, and I have never been a huge fan of these Marvel movies-Star Wars and Harry Potter are blockbuster franchises that I like much more. And sometimes the writing is a bit out of hand, and having more than twenty main characters obviously translates to the fact than not all are very well developed. Herein, also lies a great problem. Avengers: Infinity War is a great film, make no mistake, with the best superhero film ending since The Dark Knight, but in order to really know these characters(except for Thanos, who is surprisingly fleshed out and could contend to the title of Main Character in this film) you have to watch their solo films-something that sadly is necessary for a franchise like this.But, otherwise from that, this here really is a great film.",7
Marvel Knows How to Make Crossovers,31 July 2022,"While Avengers: Infinity War does quite a bit of jumping around, it creates a great crossover event unrivaled until Endgame. Thor and the Guardians of the Galaxy are a blast to experience, Steve's team in Wakanda is full of action and intensity, and the same can be said for Tony's in space. To this day, I think this movie has a few of the top greatest action sequences in Marvel movies and action movies in general. I have found myself watching this movie just to enjoy the choreography and intensity of the fight scenes. The big fight scenes are insanely fun and have some amazing visuals that can make any watcher feel like they're in the moment, holding on for dear life. This movie carries itself well in comedy, and, in contrast, depressing situations. While some scenes I thought were a little too much, and still do, it's still a great watch, and something to look forward to when binging the MCU.",9
Works well as an ensemble piece,6 May 2018,"The Avengers : Infinity War is not going to win Best Picture, but hey as an excuse to sit in a comfortable seat in an air conditioned theater and munch popcorn, it does the trick! This film is way too difficult to talk about without spoilers. So much stuff here. I will keep everything to a general nature. This is a ensemble of Marvel characters, both good and bad. Amazing to see the multi-protagonist story structure done this deftly. George Lucas is a master at it, and well, it appears that the director here attempted to emulate him....it is a workable effort. The first act is re-introducing us to characters we all know (with a great entry by Captain America). The second act does the best it can, slipping into formulaic action and one-liners. But there is reprieve! The third act delivers a multi-layered, thought-out ending coupled with an awesome post credits easter egg scene that leads into the next film. So please folks, catch that last scene. *Just as a helpful FYI - as soon as the credits roll, there is enough time to visit the lavatory and return to view the final scene...about 5 minutes, I'd say. It is a long film, be mindful of that. There is much violence also, parents be advised. My overall impression that this film succeeds at connecting the dots (albeit we all can see what it was without the dots being connected). It is rather predictable. Some scenes, either overtly or subtly, are telegraphed to us. I am not sure if this was deliberate or desperate. You be the judge.",7
This movie isn't entertaining (exept maybe for the Thanos fans),28 April 2018,,3
An incredible experience,29 April 2018,"(spoiler free) I've only become a Marvel fan over the last couple of years, and boy was I hyped for this movie. A small part of me was still worried that it wouldn't be as good as I'd hoped (*cough* The Force Awakens *cough*). However, I left the cinema shell shocked. It was as great a movie as I could have ever hoped for.

The basic plot is well known already: Thanos is trying to collect the six infinity stones so he can wield ultimate power. It's up to the Avengers and the Guardians of the Galaxy to stop him. And that's really all you should need to know to go and watch it yourself.

The pace is unrelenting; there wasn't any time wasted. Everything kept moving the plot forward and it never became boring. Scenes with Thor and the Guardians were some of the funniest; they played off each other very well. And almost unbelievably, Thanos was a somewhat sympathetic villain (which I was sure beforehand that they wouldn't be able to do)! I don't agree with him personally of course, but can at least understand where he's coming from.

One of the criticisms I've seen was that there wasn't enough character development and this is very much unjustified in my view. Why? Well for one, when you have 20+ characters we've come to know and love, having individual character arcs would be completely impossible and frankly boring. Two, we've already had all the movies *before* to build up the characters! This is a crossover movie; we don't need to see all that. Three, there was enough of it for some of the characters, and I felt that there was a lot of depth to them, particularly in some of the more emotional scenes.

If you're one of the snobby film critics who thinks they're too good for superhero movies then don't bother. Stay at home and enjoy your movies about women falling in love with fish-men. But if you're still in touch with your inner child and want to have a great time escaping to another world for 2½ hours, I heartily recommend you watch this.",10

Best Super Hero Movie,29 April 2018,It's by far one of the best movies I've seen. And the best done by Marvel Studios. Authencity and respect to the original comic books are evident and gives the movie more power.

"A good movie, but certainly not as good as some of these reviewers make it",14 October 2018,"This is going to be a highly downvoted review due to my criticism of the movie, which feeds into what I'm about to get into.

First off, the movie was good and was well worth my time and money to see it opening weekend. Marvel has always amazed me with the scale and inter connectivity of the MCU which has never been seen before to any level of this extent, and this movie was certainly one of the most demonstrative one of Marvel's ability to connect together these heroes into one timeline.

However, apart from this demonstration of their ability to connect so many characters, the movie was just a standard super-hero film. It was far from the best movie in the MCU. The soundtrack was okay, far from the level of the works of say Hans Zimmer or James Gunn. The cinematography was decent, but Thor Ragnorok definitely gave Infinity War a run for its money in this department. And the plot itself was expected and anticipated: big villain shows up and throws people around, not much different from the poorer attempts of Sony to make a good super-hero movie.

The movie itself made good pacing for its long run time, and I found it hard to find a slower scene in the middle to use the restroom after accidentally ordering something larger than a small drink. It constantly kept me on the edge of my seat and controlled my emotions for the characters.

Overall, watch and enjoy the movie. However, don't go around citing this as the greatest movie of all time as a lot of the die-hard marvel fan-boys have. If you think this is the best movie of all time, go diversify what you have watched and ensure you've seen a lot of the movies on IMDB's top 250 list.",7

"More action, more superheroes",22 March 2020,"In terms of content, the third part feels rather void for strangers to the genre. Because all in all, compared to the first two parts, there is simply more action, more superheroes and even more aggravation towards the unforeseeable end. But it's great to see the Avengers getting more and more involved in the story from part to part. In this third part it gets serious. Because the villain is attacking the earth. Here too, new heroes are added, such as Spiderman and Doctor Strange. The technical effects in this part are extremely overwhelming and well done. Camera, sound and music result in a uniform dance. The film captivates you and sprints from one action sequence to the next. Only the final remains, and with it the last part of the Avengers.",7
Think Twice !!!,30 April 2018,"For those who hasn't watch it yet, I need to do my warning: You will not see anything memorable when you go to the theaters. You will see a movie filmed on green screen from beggining to the end and watch over 60 superheroes jumping planet to planet.

There is no outstanding acting, no appealing visuals, no impressive dialogues, no idea, no plot, no message, nothing satisfying! You may like DC style dark and serious superhero movies, you may like Marvel kind silly and funny superhero movies but you are going to hate this in both conditions.

MARVEL AT IT'S BEST.....,28 April 2018,Waited 10 years for this masterpiece and I've to say it was worth waiting. Infinity War is the best MCU movie ever. Loved each and every second of it. The ending is gonna leave you in shock. It is gonna be remembered for ages. I have never written any review before but I couldn't stop myself from sharing my thoughts about the movie. A must watch for everyone. Thank you Russo Brothers for making such a spectacular movie. Can't wait for the sequel.,10
Non spoiler review - An Emotional & Cinematic masterpiece,27 April 2018,"To be honest there are many things which you can applause for Being a Marvel & DC Comic book reader i would like to say :-

In 1 line - ""Be prepared to witnesses this spine chilling story""",10
I shut up and gladly gave Marvel my money,18 September 2018,"Infinity War doesn't differ from other Marvel production. Dialogues and jokes are sometimes good (e.g. Thor meeting Guardians), sometimes really cheap (Thanos + Gamora + Soul stone). The characters don't surprise, but the team interaction is still great to look on.

Unfortunately, story jumps from place to place across the universe, some characters disappear from the story for so long that you almost forget them. On the other hand, having 20 characters in one place would be likely even more unbearable. Unlike in previous two Avengers, where it took an hour before things started moving, Infinity War is agressive from first to last scene.

The biggest star is clearly Josh Brolin and his Thanos. Compared to previous villains, Thanos gets a lot more screentime, so his character and motivations make sense and it's easier to symphatize with him (to some extent). He's a bulldozer, smashing all superheroes like flies, without anything/anyone being able to stop him. The movie ending serves, of course, just as a spectacular effect. The feeling of hopelessness and fear from Thanos is pretty well transfered upon the viewer.

Infinity War doesn't show anything new. It's not easy to entertain with the same thing over and over again but Marvel did it. Despite having 10-15 main characters it still holds together and doesn't feel like some confused mash-up (ehm, Justice League, ehm). Bravo Marvel, bravo.",8
Worth The 10 Year Wait,28 April 2018,"If you've been following the MCU since the beginning then the payoff this movie offers is incredible. An incredible Cast, and an incredible story offer one of the best superhero movies of all time, if not the best.",10
Best ever,29 April 2018,,10
Shut down your broadband before the big stuff launches,29 April 2019,"Not knowing there would be a sequel, this ending trumps all endings ever. Knowledge is power, but ignorance is truly bliss",10
Some nice action and good ending,17 May 2018,"I hope this was the last Marvel movie, at least last one concerning this story continuum. If it is not, i will be disappointed. Infinity War has good, memorable ending. If it is spoiled by future movies with the help of some ""gotcha-trick"", this movie will not stand a classic. If it is left as-is now, it will stand as a cult classic for generations.

Sadly we all know how this will go.

The movie itself suffers from basic action-hero-clichees. Why not try to gang the villain with a planetful of groots, every possible hero and the army? Why send a couple of ordinary heroes against something that is already master of the universe? It makes no sense. Also, the narrative suffers from too many places and persons until things move forward after an hour or so.

Extra star for good villain. Though Thanos is very boring, just purple mass of meat with a 80s style boxing glove, his intentions and backrounds are opened up well and he has some soul. Even more than some of the heroes.",7
A New Era,29 April 2018,,9
Mixed but okay by the end,10 June 2018,"Avengers: Infinity War

Continuing the blockbuster series: a massive gang of comic book super-heroes attempt to stop the evil Thanos (Josh Brolin) from obtaining all six of the all-powerful Infinity Stones which would give him ultimate power to dominate the entire universe.

Like many big-budget blockbusters (BBBs), this one falls into the usual trap of too much happening and too many people to try to remember. Adding to this problem are too many corny jokes and some really bad attempts at humour. Also like other BBBs, ""Infinity War"" has superb special effects, action scenes, and other aspects of technical superiority. The pluses mostly outweigh the minuses though not always.

Still, there are moving scenes in the second half that raise the film to a higher level. Credit must be given for a very bold ending which is a welcome contradiction to traditional narratives.

So, despite some obvious flaws, ""Infinity War"" is still entertaining.",7

Incredible,19 July 2021,"From start to finish, this movie is fascinating. I can remember being in shock for a couple of hours after leaving a completely silent theather when the movie was over, I guess I wasn't the only one that was shocked. This is the best MCU film by far, the villian is polished and you can understand his motives (even though its crazy). He's very scary and intimidating but weirdly emotional at the same time. I would actually rate this movie a 9.5, I just think the humor is a tad too much and should've been toned down a bit. I've seen this movie many times and it only gets better with every viewing, incredible job marvel.",10
Red Wedding of Superhero movies,29 April 2018,,10
Putting it in Context,2 June 2018,"I was not going to write a review for this film, but having seen so many negative reviews for this film, I feel it is important to put things in context. You should not watch this movie if you have not seen the other MCU films. There have been reviews stating that this film has no plot and that it is just mindless action. That is basically true. The film cannot stand on its own and it was not meant to. Someone described this film like the season finale of a TV show. The characters and plot of this film have been set up over the course of many other movies. If you come into this film not knowing that, it will seem like a mess to you. However, for those of us who have watched the previous MCU films and grown to love these characters, we do not need a set up. We know where we are and what is at steak.

This movie is the culmination of ten years of storytelling. As the end to a ten year buildup this film is excellent. It is exciting and emotional. It is fun to see different characters interacting with each other. Characters who have never met before are forced together and the results are funny and interesting. At no time during this film was I bored. Many times I was on the edge of my seat wondering how our heroes were going to save the day. I was shocked to see what characters lived and died.

Thanos as the villain of the film was excellent. He was compelling and scary. He is a commanding presence. This film sticks with you after it ends not only because of what happens at the end, but because of the powerful performance of Josh Brolin as Thanos. This is a highly satisfying film for anyone who has followed these characters for so long.",9
"Amazing,",29 April 2018,I was so excited about this movie and it didn't disappoint.,10
A Modern Action/Adventure Classic,22 July 2021,"Loved it when I first saw it, and love it more every time I watch it. While it may not have the exact depth in writing as other films in its genre, Infinity War makes up for that with many great characters moments, a clever balance of humor and darkness (and this film is considerably dark when compared to other MCU installments), breathtaking action scenes that are well-placed and not just used for the sake of having a big action scene to keep audiences entertained. Of course, Infinity War is part of the broader film series, the Marvel Cinematic Universe and although catching up on previous installments in the franchise can certainly enhance the viewing experience, I do still believe it works fabulously as a stand-alone film; I actually like it best when thinking about it as a race against time or heist film. (also, case in point, I saw this movie for the first time with almost no prior knowledge of the MCU, so take that as you will) On top of that, the villain of the story, Thanos, has become iconic in pop culture, and for good reason. While he certainly earns the name of the ""Mad Titan"", his intentions are at least comprehensible and that to me is not an easy balance to strike; many villains in films suffer in writing due to this imbalance. I could go on about this movie as it is somewhere at least in my top 100 films, but I will leave it at that. I do consider this film to be a modern action/adventure classic and absolutely recommend it to all fans of the genre; it is truly worth your time.",10
a welcome change in an American film,30 May 2021,"Yes, it's worth watching on the big screen for the incredible MCU-multi-main-character action showdown sequences, that all these films have built up to, as well as the relentless pacing from it's ""medias res"" opening. It's also a welcome change because it pulls the rug from under most triumphalistic (Disney) American films in that it's wiling to eliminate characters and leave the audience at a loss to how the narrative will move forward in a world where the ones you're counting on are so utterly defeated. But what's most striking, and terrifying, is how timely the film is (the Russo brothers' helmed Marvel films have said a lot about our socio-political realties) with a villain that views the world as a zero-sum game and so believes it is righteous to cast aside entire populations.",7
Believe the Hype,29 April 2018,"I tried my best to not raise expectations with the combination of the 10 year buildup of movies and the audience anticipation of this movie, but I failed. My expectations were higher than some people will be on their fourth viewing of this movie trying to experience some new colours. While I failed in controlling my expectations, Avengers: Infinity War exceeded every one of them.

The characters of 18 different movies with very different styles and tones were brought together with no property being sacrificed. Characters were combined in a number of creative ways, but they didn't waste every option in the first movie. Several Characters were left on the bench so we can have some fresh blood in part 2.

We all expected that not every character would make it out of this movie, but the who and the when were always up in the air. Those whose numbers came up, they were (for the most part) completely unexpected and came at times when I wasn't ready. Some are gone for good and will be missed moving forward into the next phase of the MCU. Others? Well, without giving anything away, I'm sure we will see some again.

Can we all just remember that the Russo Brothers came up doing Sitcoms? These men wrote and directed some of the most creative (and fiercely underappreciated) TV comedy in Arrested Development and Community, among other things and they were brought up to take on some of the meatiest films in the MCU. I thought Marvel was crazy, and they were. Crazy like a Fox (which Disney also now owns). These men have set a bar that is going to be tough to surpass.

I advise everyone to go see this movie. Go and leave your comic book expectations at the door. A certain faction of comic fans are chomping at the bit to hate these movies because a different character says a line in the movie vs. the book and it is a tragedy. To the people who hated Lord of the Rings for the lack of Tom Bombadil, the people who hated the Last Jedi because Luke Skywalker had more tricks up his sleeve than when we last saw him in Episode VI (which by the way were all a part of the old Legends Material that they so wanted to be Canon), try hoping for the best and not combing the movie in search of the worst and you may just accidentally have a good time. Although, I expect that some of you would still be blown away.

I thank Marvel for the 18 movies that brought us to this point and for bringing them together in a way that I can only describe as a symphony. I look forward to what you plan on doing when this stage of the franchise's life has passed.",10
A Good Avengers Cinema. 7.4/10,6 September 2018,"Let's get started. I'm not going to compare Infinity War to any other film. This is just a review of Infinity War itself.

In Avengers Infinity War, the Avengers unite to protect the powerful Infinity Stones from the mass murderer Thanos who seeks to destroy half the life in the universe to restore ""ultimate balance"" to the universe so suffering may cease.

That seems like a good idea, and it's actually a fairly classic superhero plot. The problem is is that it's exaggerated to a point where you have to believe in fantasies of a whole new degree. I mean come on, how old is the idea of half the life in the universe disappearing? To me it's way too kiddish and cheesy.

But let's get started on what I like about Infinity War. Infinity War takes the idea of uniting the Avengers beautifully and it leads up to a nice and ballsy ending. The CGI of Infinity War is quite spectacular and everything does look alien as it should. The native looks native and the alien looks alien. The battles are thrilling and the cinematography and special effects are off the roof. The acting is brilliant as well.

Then why am I rating this movie a 7/10?

Because it makes a good film to watch with friends and family. Not a film you'd want to watch on your own and that makes you feel more completed as a person.

Infinity War felt like one of those action films you can watch as a high school or college student and enjoy thoroughly. I watched it recently with my friends and generally superhero movies were supposed to be like that. An enjoyable family friend experience. But nowadays, the meaning of superhero movies has changed into something different. Superhero movies aren't just about blockbuster action and thrilling special effects nowadays.

Infinity War took the classic route to Superhero blockbuster action and I can say. We've had too much of it lately. It's not a movie I'd probably even thinking about watching alone at home or late at night in my room because it doesn't make you feel any different anyway beginning to end. Too many plotholes exist and lilttle character development take place. And PLOT and CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT are key to a spectacular movie.

But I won't deny that I enjoyed it. I certainly did enjoy Infinity War, but I felt that it lacked in too many places. I'm saying this as a true movie head as I love films which touch the heart and have thrilling action. But Infinity War only has thrilling action. Nothing much else really. An incredibly thrilling movie to watch, but not a spectacular movie in any other aspect. It's a good movie to watch for the adrenaline and nothing else really.

Comparing this to other cinemas, I'd have probably rated this movie a 6.8/10. This movie is a blockbuster movie and it wont retain it's place in time. That's my review.",7

I'm Too Old for These Movies,26 July 2024,"I've watched so many Marvel movies. They are all pretty much the same. Here we have two and a half hours, featuring every conceivable superhero. Unfortunately, I should have bought a guidebook, so I could keep track of who's who and who doesn't like who, or whatever. I know the modern audience demand continuous fighting. There is so much attack and response that it all blends together. I know that Thanos is the bad guy and he needs those stones because he is a religious fanatic who wants to wipe out half the universe. He wants balance. But a good movie should still bring in those who didn't spend their childhoods reading comic books. I am not stupid, but at times I had no idea what was going on other than it was going to bring an end to Josh Brolin. But! Is the next movie a sequel or will they act like it never happened. I know that Strange can jump around in multiple times and universes. I was disappointed with how it all ended, cheated out of a satisfactory resolution. Sometimes a little more simple can be better.",8
The Greatest Comic Book Movie of All Time,29 April 2018,"'Avengers: Infinity War' is a film 10 years in the making. Marvel Studios has been building to this since the first 'Iron Man' back in 2008, and it is more than worth the wait. Infinity War has everything you could want in a film of this scale: mind-blowing action, gut-busting humor, extremely satisfying character interactions, a terrifying villain you can kind of sympathize with, and a few truly heartbreaking moments. The film's directors, the Russo brothers, manage to fit all of this into a nearly 3 hour movie and still have it flow perfectly from one scene to the next. The pacing is fantastic for the amount of major characters in one movie. It never felt slow or boring and kept my eyes glued to the screen. The action scenes are the best I've ever seen in a superhero movie. It was like watching a comic book come to life. Seeing the different heroes fight alongside each other was incredible, and every character has a moment to shine. Infinity War marked the first crossover between the Avengers and the Guardians of the Galaxy, and their various interactions were everything I ever wanted them to be. The humor was hilarious, yet never felt out-of-place. The scenes that needed to be serious were exactly as they should have been. The film's villain, Thanos (portrayed brilliantly by Josh Brolin), is without a doubt the Marvel Cinematic Universe's best and most interesting antagonist to date. He commanded the screen and stole every scene he was in. He is also by far the most real looking CGI character I have ever seen. Unfortunately, he is responsible for pretty much all of the heartbreaking moments I mentioned earlier. If you think this is just another happy, bright Marvel movie, you are sorely mistaken. This is a war, and not everyone makes it out alive. My advice? Bring tissues. Lots and lots of tissues. As for standout performances, there are a few. Josh Brolin (Thanos), Chris Hemsworth (Thor), Elizabeth Olsen (Scarlet Witch), and Zoe Saldana (Gamora) all had major roles in the film and their acting was on point. In conclusion, 'Avengers: Infinity War' is not only the best Marvel movie to date, it is the greatest comic book movie of all time.",10

A film that lived up to expectations,2 May 2023,"Avengers: Infinity War is hands down one of the greatest superhero films made to date. It brings every current MCU hero together to fight the common enemy that fans alike have been waiting years to see come to the big screen. When mad titan Thanos is on a mission the collect all six infinity stones, it's up to Iron Man, Hulk, Thor, Captain America, Black Widow, Black Panther, Doctor Strange, Wong, Spider-Man, The Guardians of the Galaxy, and the rest of the remaining Avengers to fight the powerful titan in a fight to save the universe. So first off, The Russo Brothers did a fantastic job bringing all these hero's together for this film. Robert Downey Jr is great as always as Iron Man putting his new nanotechnology to good use. Chris Hemsworth Thor is magnificent, bringing us probably one of the best versions of the character we have ever seen. Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner/Hulk is also great even though we got more of Bruce Banner instead of Hulk in this film. Chris Evans as Captain America is great as always showing us more of his character that is now on the run including Scarlett Johansson's Natasha Romanoff/ Black Widow and Anthony Mackie's Sam Wilson/Falcon. The Guardians of the Galaxy are great too with there interactions with some of the Avengers. Zoe Saldana's Gamora stands out the most out of all them in this film. Chadwick Boseman's Black Panther is also fantastic that is not only just joining the fight against Thanos, but bringing the whole nation of Wakanda with him along for the fight including Sebastian Stan's Bucky Barnes/The Winter Soldier who is also great. The best character throughout the whole film that really made this film as great as it is, is Josh Brolin's Thanos. He really brings the long awaited character to the big screen in fashion, as the film mostly follows his journey to collect the infinity stones, while the Avengers try to stop him. On the journey, he must deal with what his destiny is, tragedy, and stopping anyone that gets in his way. Thanos is so far my favorite villain to ever come to the MCU mainly, because I think he has the best purpose out of any villain in the MCU for what he's doing and the way it's captured is absolutely extraordinary. Overall, Avengers: Infinity War is hands down one of the greatest superhero movies ever made, while also bringing us all the hero's we've waited so long to see in one film as well as bringing us one of the greatest superhero villains we have ever seen. Rating 10/10.",10
"hillarious, intense & heartbreaking",18 May 2019,"Avengers: Infinity War is an epic, bold, & brutal blockbuster whose apocalyptic sensibilities never outweigh the film's colorful and personality-rich soul. The plot sews together a decade of story threads, characters, & tones allowing Marvel's cadre of superheroes to square off against a killer of world's. Directing with an eye on the individual personalities of the film's characters and the weight of the plot's machinations, Joe and Anthony Russo create a balanced and invigorating piece of work. Action sequences are imbued with emotional heft, and characters spar with the unique tone and color developed in previous films. Every resource onscreen is committed to bringing something larger than life to bear. Whether it is the cast offering individual and stand-out portraits of supercharacters; or the filmmakers involved in shooting, editing, scoring, and designing the visual and sonic world of the film; every element ticks with cinematic gloriousness and grand scale.

Just What I Expected,1 May 2018,"I recently saw Avengers: Infinity War and I thought it was a good film. I went into this film expecting to see some great actions and banter from the cast and I just about got that.

I like that the story kept itself simple (although it sometimes does seem like the films in a bit of a hurry for Thanos to get the Infinity Stones) and doesn't try to be darker than it needs to be or trying hard to be funny. The cast worked well off each other and honestly it's amazing that the Russo Brothers managed to make a film like this work so well with such a gigantic cast. If it were poorly directed than it could've been a huge, cluttered mess and probably unwatchable. The visuals were decent and the action scenes, while not as thrilling as, lets say, the first Avengers film, were fun to watch. Seeing the Guardians of the Galaxy cast with the rest of the Avengers was a joy to watch and I feel that the run-time was just right (Despite being over 2 hours long which I didn't even notice). However the best part of the film is Thanos. It's really good to have a Marvel villain that not only doesn't suck and have a lack of screen time (cough 'Yellow Jacket' cough), but actually be threatening and interesting. Like a good villain should be. He definitely makes the viewing all the MCU movies worth it and I can't wait to see more of him.

However the film uses the death fake-out a little bit with certain characters. Where you think one character will die only to be survive and not be killed at all (although it's not as bad as The Lord of the Rings Trilogy). I also wasn't interested with a part involving Thor, Rocket and Groot in the middle of the film and (while I did praise the film for managing a big cast well) some characters don't have much of a role within the film. That mostly being Dr. Strange, The Guardians, War-Machine and even Captain America. It's also a film that I don't see much re-watch value in. It's like Mad Max: Fury Road for me, once I've seen it there's not much reason to watch it again.

Overall I thought Infinity War was a pretty good film and I suggest to any fan of superhero movies to watch it although you probably already have seen it or just going to see it.",7

Blockbusting,30 April 2018,,8
"Hands down, the greatest superhero movie of all time.",15 July 2023,"""Infinity war"" is the ultimate comic book movie. It's the pinnacle of the genre. The way they were able to put together all the multifaceted characters is just perfect. It's hard for me to imagine anything ever topping it.

I've never been a fan of superhero movies. I enjoyed them like any other action movies that are fun to watch once and then forget about. ""Infinity War"" completely blew me away in that regard. I still can't stop thinking about it. From the first seconds, the grim atmosphere let me know that something special awaited me.

What really made the movie for me is the main antagonist, Thanos. Thanos is the best villain, or should I say ""antihero"", of all time, in my opinion. He's definitely my favorite. Yeah, the solution he came up with is somewhat questionable, but his motivation was definitely good. In my eyes, Thanos is as much a hero as any of the Avengers, if not greater. When you really think about it, while the Avengers only bothered themselves with the well-being of their fellow Earthlings, Thanos had a grander vision. He cared not only about his own species but about all living beings in the entire Universe. Unlike the superheroes who were mostly reactive (they would be doing nothing if bad guys weren't causing trouble), Thanos was proactive. He took it upon himself to make the Universe a better place, not for his own benefit, but for the sake of all living creatures out there. He took the risk and eventually paid the price for it. I mean, he knew the pursuing and realization of his ultimate goal might cost him life, but he still went for it anyway, for the common good. If that isn't the ultimate sacrifice of a true hero, then I don't know what is.

The ending is what elevates the movie from the ranks of merely good to great. That's why the sequel could never surpass it, as such an ending would be impossible in the true final installment of the franchise. I dare to say the ending is one of the best in the history of cinema.",10

Extremely long mix of Dragon Ball with Lord of the Rings,9 October 2021,"No one should be surprised by the film's lack of creativity. There is an evil villain who comes from space (like Freezer) who has powerful allies (like Freezer) and is looking for some infinity gems that at this point are very similar to dragon balls. By putting them together he will have immense power (as in Dragon Ball). The good guys unite and battle here and on other planets (as in Dragon Ball). The final battle aspires to be monumental and there are rare animals and structures (as in the Lord of the Rings). Some of the good guys die (as in Dragon Ball and Lord of the Rings). There is a bit of drama with relationship or relationship problems (as in any movie you've ever seen). I rescue a couple of interesting sequences that make this waste of money worth a six. If it were for the lack of creativity, artistic laziness and lack of interest generated, I would give it a three.",6

Better than expectations....,27 April 2018,10 years in making....and a grand finale. A flood of emotions hits u as the characters reveal their distinct persona.....The ego clash between doc and stark.....The newly recruited Spidey who doesn't wanna disappoint..... Hulk with his 'issues'....Star lord's jealousy towards Thor.....The love between Wanda and vision....And most importantly the heart within the Titan.... Everything makes your butt stick to the seat even when the movie gets over.....You might need some tissues for the climax. The grandeur of the fight sequence and the way it is filmed just blows our brains out....A solid villain with a solid intentions who almost convinces us that he is doing the right thing. The visuals are extraordinary and flawless making it a visual treat.... A part of the final portion is a bit 'surreal' but overall a celebration with a mixture of emotions delivered on correct propotions for this summer.,9
"Quite unorthodox, and amazing because of that",26 December 2020,"When I went into this movie I had already heard the praise, so naturally I had high expectations. With that in mind, it's even more impressive how much I ended up liking this movie. Marvel really suprised me with the direction they went with this story. I expected a boring villain, a few cool CGI-infested fightscenes and an epic final showdown where all the heroes gather, but this movie went in a completely different direction with almost every aspect. The visuals and score are obviously good, but nothing groundbreaking, as per usual, and the plot is really simple: A bunch of people try to stop an overpowered alien from obtaining the ultimate power, nothing special there. The pacing is solid though, and even though the plot isn't super interesting, it's still passable, and is made even better by this movie's greatest strength; the characters. This movie incorporates almost every single character previously seen into the movie, and makes it work by not really having any filler. The conversations are simple yet engaging, the characters are, as always, well-defined and entertaining. The movie juggles its different tones very effectively, it has both great comedy and some of the strongest emotional moments in the entire franchise. The biggest suprise of this movie however, is its villain. MCU villains has been bad more often than not, so it was incredibly satisfying to finally get a villain that is truly fenomenal. Thanos is by far the best villain Marvel has ever created, and a lot of that is thanks to the human attributes he has. Despite being a giant space-monster, he doesn't feel comical at all. He feels threatening, and while his goal is simple, his motivation makes sense, and it's fascinating to watch him talk about how he is right in doing all these evil things. He also has a strong emotional core, which is showcased the clearest in his conversations with Gamora. The movie also has a very unexpected ending, which caught me completely off-guard, and frustrated me a lot, but in a good way. All this, combined with the usual great performances and comedy we've gotten used to seeing from Marvel, makes for one of the best superhero movies released this decade.",9

A visual sensation with action occasionally lacking pulse,5 August 2018,"An American action thriller; The Avengers assemble for a third time and the result is an astonishing and sensate extravaganza, ambitious in scale, imaginative in backdrops and attractive settings thanks to some wonderful CGI rendering. The movie's biggest accolade should be reserved for the writers who had to satisfy avid followers of the film series by featuring and distilling so many outlandish characters from previous sagas and still make it engaging. The result was a success - the heroes' egos jam up alongside each other beautifully. Robert Downey Jr is on top form once more, and the Guardians of the Galaxy troop provide welcome comedic relief. Also, Thanos, is the most meaningful and personal antagonist of the series. All in all it is an exciting epic, but with the dizzying array of heroes came a steady succession of overlong fighting sequences which occasionally lack a pulse and will become desensitising for some viewers who will say there's only so many times you can watch someone being kicked and punched through a wall.",6
Best marvel film ever,29 April 2018,Short and simple don't want give anything away it's by far the best marvel film recommend everyone go see it,10
Bring something to occupy your attention.,26 August 2018,"Meh.

At almost 2-1/2 hours, A:IW is a mish-mosh of tangled story threads that have no place in the same film, barely able to justify their absurdly overlong fight scenes, each of which includes ludicrously inconsistent strengths and weaknesses on both sides.

Early snarky dialog gave me the impression that there would at least be the edgy humor that characterizes the best of the Marvel films, but the gaps between instances of such writing are huge to the point of boring.

The story is thin, hard to believe (even for a Marvel film), and will be largely incomprehensible unless you remember almost everything from the eighteen other films in the franchise (or, as I was, are willing to pause repeatedly to Google up the answers to your questions).

My teenage son often watches videos on his iPhone while simultaneously playing a game on his Nintendo Switch. I find it hard to believe he can really pay enough attention to know what's happening in a video while also playing a game. After watching ""Infinity War,"" however, I would recommend having a toy in your hands if you plan to see it.",6
A little disappointed - expected more ...,30 June 2018,"Before you pay the witches some loot to go for me, hear me out please;

The graphics and special effects - brilliant. The story line, well. I do think that they should maybe consider appoint better script writers in the future. It just maybe work on paper but it did not go that well on film. The other major point that just beat the heck out of me was the over focus of certain characters and then the total lack of others.

This was more a ""cleanup"" movie than anything else. The end also, just WAY too much and the result thereof - really. The plot was good to a certain point and then this over focus of elements / characters.

My sisters (twins) LOVE this movie. Probably watched it in cinema already 4 times together. We do have different taste in stuff and that all fine, I just donated the majority of the Avenger / Hulk / Marvel DVD's to the library. Maybe someone will have more perspective than me. This movie halted it all on my side.",1
"The Marvel you must watch. More of the same sometimes, A thousand times better all the time",29 April 2018,,10
A super movie,18 July 2021,"Jesus Christ! Not only does this film reach our expectations as a film, it surpasses them. There are quite a few things I like about this film so this review may take a while to read.

Firstly, the Russo brothers obviously show deep appreciation for the MCU and the effort they put in for this film is clearly visible with so many awesomely-handled pivotal moments in the film's plot. It seems that many of the MCU's best films are directed by Anthony and Joe Russo and that doesn't surprise me one bit.

Compared to many MCU films, the acting in this film is phenomenal. Everyone in the cast deeply cares for this film and you can tell that they all understand the significance of this feature. Shout out to Jeremy Renner, who portrays Clint Barton/Hawkeye who's character really developed into something new and better in this film and I'm looking forward to seeing the character in future instalments.

Alan Silvestri is a master of musical score in media. In both Endgame and Infinity War his music adds so much tension to nearly every scene that it appears in. I honestly feel that with his involvement in the MCU, Silvestri has propelled himself to be one of the great film composers with individuals like Hans Zimmer and John Williams.

The action in this film is perfectly balanced with the more down-to-Earth scenes in the film, which I'll get into later. The climatic battle, in particular, is a masterpiece to behold. Every character in that scene just the amount of screen time they deserve. No one gets too much or too little, in my opinion and this scene should be enough to impress any comic-book fan.

The visuals, as is the case with much of the MCU, is flawless. The attention to detail in such characters as Thanos or Rocket is beautiful and nearly every bit of CGI we get in these films is a bonafide work of art.

Finally, the emotional weight in this film is truly stronger than that of any other MCU film by far. It's unbelievable how it could top Infinity War. The opening scene is pretty well done in the sense that it was genius to make the first scene spectacular.

Overall, I'm so happy that the finale to a 22-film story is this film. This film will probably be considered a classic in around a decade's time. This film never fails to disappoint. Anyone who doesn't enjoy this film, well, let's just say that they cannot be called a fan of the MCU.",10

Near Perfect Superhero Movie,29 April 2018,"The Russo Brothers have created something that could have messed up really bad. But it doesn't and is complete perfection. Lets me first start off by saying the wait for Thanos was definitely worth it. Josh Brolin puts in a spectacular performance into Thanos and really does scare you and most importantly you buy his motives, I would even go as far as saying that Thanos is maybe the best MCU villain to date. Another thing that I would applaud the Russo Brothers for is definitely not pulling any punches, when action is needed it is great, even better than their last superhero movies. And when their is emotion needed you definitely feel it. But one of my favorite things in this movies is the Universal stakes really hit home on a visceral level were this may not be the case on many of the past comic book movies. Lastly, this is not a stand alone movie, this is a movie one decade int he making and you definitely feel that fro the opening credits to the end credits. I would strongly recommend anyone who has invested time into this series to watch this movies or maybe even your casual moviegoer.",9
Before you judge; Watch all the MCU movies,21 April 2019,"I've read through a lot of these reviews, and it is evident that IW is the first MCU movie these folks have watched. So they will all say 'too many heroes', 'how come they didn't do this or that', 'Thanos had four of the Stones on titan, how could they have almost taken the gauntlet from him'.

OK, OK, OK.... First up, Thanos didn't know the full extent of the power of the stones coz he hasn't used them before. So it was all new to him. Everytime he used the stones to FIGHT, it was hardly a calculated effort, it was always reactionary. The element of surprise is what the Avengers used against Thanos, so at first he would attempt to fight without using the stones until he decides to use them.

If you think the plot is shallow you might want to watch from the first movie (Ironman 2008) to understand the emotions, behavior, temperament & power of these heroes & villains.

And for those saying the Black order aka children of Thanos just came from nowhere, do you expect an origin story for everyone?

Unnecessary emotional hangover,7 May 2018,"Marvel has not followed the comics closely or consistently, hence the reason this film caught me so off guard...it was like GOT on steroids. The body count is ridiculous! People go to the movies to be entertained, this movie is no fun! Most people left the premiere looking stunned or irritated.",5
The best that the MCU has to offer,20 May 2023,"I am not personally a fan of the standard Marvel Film formula, I think the majority of Marvel films end up falling into the 4/10-6/10 range. However, whenever a film branches out from the standard MCU template, such as the X-Men films or Into the Spiderverse, it can be really good. This movie was special in that is was a part of the mainline MCU series, and still managed to do something completely different from what audiences are used to. And not only was this branching out, it also tied together over twenty movies and provided an excellent climax to the overarching plotline of Thanos and the Infinity Stones. While I have mixed feelings about Endgame, which serves as the conclusion to the MCU Infinity Stones Saga, this film is the climax, and is executed in a nearly flawless way.

The film actually manages to massively improve upon the plotline from the comics, as in the comics Thanos was trying to kill half the universe to impress Death, because Death is female in Marvel comics and Thanos wants to be romantically involved with her. This is actually the plot of the comics, and is honestly pretty stupid, so I really like that his motivation was changed for the film.

Only real issue with the movie is that it still has some of the cheesy Marvel ""awkward"" comedy, but it's a lot more toned down in this film compared to all of the other movies. There is also the fact that some plotlines with certain characters are set up and then not addressed in Endgame, but that's more of an issue with Endgame rather than Infinity War, so it should not be considered a detriment to this movie.

9/10 If you like Superhero films this is a must see.",9

Narrative Payoff In The MCU's Climax,15 December 2020,"There was a time when Marvel movies failed to pique my interest. I would see the latest one, enjoy it as an action film, and quickly forget about it shortly after leaving the theater. All of that changed when ""Avengers: Infinity War"" came out in 2018.

""Infinity War"" is the nineteenth film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and it can be read as the climax to the 10-year-old franchise's vast story. Ever since the first Avengers film debuted in 2012, Marvel has been teasing an arch-villain named Thanos (Josh Brolin) being responsible for most of the mayhem taking place in the massive degesis. In ""Infinity War,"" Thanos finally emerges as the direct threat, enacting a plan to wipe out half of the universe's population for ecological stability.

The movie brings together all of the MCU heroes minus Paul Rudd's Ant-Man and Jeremy Renner's Hawkeye. Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr), Captain America (Chris Evans), Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman), Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen), Vision (Paul Bettany), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbach), Spider-Man (Tom Holland) and Thor (Chris Hemsworth) all come together to combat Thanos. The impressive cast only grows when the Guardians of the Galaxy (featuring Chris Pratt's Starlord, Zoe Saldana's Gamora, Dave Bautista's Drax, Vin Diesel's Groot, Karen Gillian's Nebula, Pom Klementieff's Mantis, and Bradley Cooper's Rocket Raccoon) also join the fight.

The star power alone is almost overwhelming, but somehow, all characters get their due, each playing a crucial part in the surprisingly balanced plot. Nothing feels forced into ""Infinity War."" It is a huge film, but a well-orchestrated one. Obviously, there is a lot of action and adventure, but the film also makes time for captivating dialogue and humor. Some of the movie's best moments consist of witty bickering between Starlord, Thor, and Iron Man - all of whom are at their finest here.

Really, all of the characters - with the exception of maybe Black Panther - shine brighter in ""Infinity War"" than they do in any other MCU movies, including their standalone titles. Meanwhile, Thanos also stands out as the heroes' greatest enemy thus far, and the series' best-constructed villain.

From the antagonist's perspective, he actually wants to save the universe. A consequentialist, Thanos believes that killing half of all living things will solve the Malthusian Crisis that all civilizations eventually face. This philosophical stance is antithetical to that of the superheroes, who prefer to maintain a status quo despite any long-term detriments. Thanos is thus a character of significant depth, and his presence makes viewers consider the limits of heroism in a perpetually jeopardized universe - a similar theme to the one tackled in Alan Moore and David Gibbon's legendary graphic novel ""Watchmen.""

It is because of Thanos that I changed my mind about Marvel. Through the villain, ""Infinity War"" stands out as a subversion of the superhero genre. However, it would not be nearly as impactful if it weren't the product of the eighteen movies leading up to it. Because of its predecessors, ""Infinity War"" can be larger than itself and hit even harder when defying preconceived notions of superhero ethics.

One can still view the MCU as an amplification of blockbuster sequelization in modern Hollywood, or as an excuse for Disney to sell toys, or as a cash-grabbing, CGI-infused appropriation of cinema. But despite all of these criticisms, Marvel movies remain effectively entertaining, and ""Infinity War"" demonstrates that producer Kevin Feige has been cleverly engineering this behemoth from the beginning. Intricate details going all the way back to 2008's ""Iron Man"" culminate for a momentous conclusion here.

Of course, ""Infinity War"" is not the end of the MCU. In fact, it is not even the end of the Infinity Saga - 2019's ""Avengers: Endgame"" takes that title. Nevertheless, the film still feels like the extensive narrative's most pivotal chapter. It might be somewhat inaccessible for people not caught up on the Marvel universe, but even an outsider can appreciate it as an epic, game-changing movie that justifies the MCU as a wholly worthwhile cinematic endeavor.",8

Avengers Insanity Wars,29 June 2022,,6
"Bombastically ambitious, completely exhilarating and emotional, Infinity War is truly epic.",29 April 2018,"Everything about Marvel's latest addition in its sprawling, epic MCU franchise feels overwhelmingly massive. Boasting the largest cast of any Marvel movie yet, a storyline on a colossal scale and a supervillain finally getting his chance to step forth into the limelight, Avengers: Infinity War has much to live up to. Since its genesis in 2008 with Iron Man, the MCU has been thriving for an impressive ten years, continuously expanding and, for better or for worse, birthing the term 'cinematic universe'. Thanos (Josh Brolin) searches high and low across the universe to complete his collection of infinity stones. Once all have been retrieved and inserted into his golden gauntlet, he will be granted world dominating power and become an unstoppable juggernaut of destruction. With so much at stake, the Avengers, along with the Guardians of the Galaxy and various other superheroes including Spider-Man (Tom Holland), Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) and Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), must unite to defeat Thanos before their world is torn apart. As much as I was anticipating Infinity War, I was also anxious due to the sheer weight of it all. Sure, the geeky fanboy in me was psyched to see such an ensemble, but there was still the fear that the film would feel too overcrowded. Thankfully, the Russo brothers pull it off with such grandeur, resulting in one of the very best Marvel films yet.

Firstly, Thanos is without a doubt the best villain this franchise has brought into the fold. Marvel is known for its villain problem, only offering a small handful of memorable antagonists such as Loki (Tom Hiddleston) and Ultron (James Spader), but the Russo's quickly establish Thanos to be the most threatening force to be reckoned with within the films opening ten minutes. Convincing villains are difficult to write, but for all his evil and destructive nature, Thanos is given an emotional depth that is sourly lacking in many villains these days, in both comic books and movies. In many ways, the film feels like it belongs to Thanos himself. As they've already proven in The Winter Soldier (2014) and Civil War (2016), the Russo's know how to present their audience with stellar action sequences, and Infinity War's action is just as brilliant. It's a breathless spectacle to witness, and it never relies too heavily on shaky cam, resulting in clear cut action sequences that never feel strenuous to keep up with.

One of the most notable things about the film is its collision of various voices. Throughout the MCU, multiple directors have made their mark on the franchise. James Gunn's wonderful Guardians of the Galaxy films are known for their colourful, upbeat tempo's and infectious soundtracks, whilst the first two Thor movies are rooted more within the dark fantasy genre, particularly it's sequel. Understanding this, the Russo's manage to incorporate all these unique voices into one movie to ensure every character is portrayed as accurately as possible according to their respective solo outings. Throughout the films heavier moments, the Russo's never forget to incorporate humour into the mix to prevent it being 100% doom and gloom. With so many characters to juggle, there are a handful of heroes who don't get as much screen time as they deserve, and a side mission involving Thor (Hemsworth) isn't as engaging as the rest of the film, yet it never drags the film down completely.

It's difficult to dive too deep into the film without giving away any spoilers. What I will say is that Marvel are finally beginning to take risks with their storytelling. The stakes have never been higher, and Infinity War is without a doubt one the most exhausting and exhilarating chapters in the MCU. Bombastically ambitious, bursting with action and emotion as well as a jaw dropping finale that will leave you feeling somewhat cold, Infinity War is truly spectacular and the perfect film to celebrate ten years of the MCU.",9

They created a relatable villain for all of our favorite super heroes to fight against. With this star studded cast it is easy to think that everyone could get screen time. Though some heroes get more than others, they still all get their fair share of time. The sheer scope of the movie is beyond comprehension but they somehow made it work fluently. You will laugh, you will be mad, and you will cry all at once. Never have I ever walked out of a Marvel movie without words to comprehend what I just saw. Go see this movie in the biggest theater you can.",10
A great commercial blockbuster,15 August 2020,,7
The epic culmination of a decade's worth of films doesn't disappoint.,14 June 2022,"In my opinion, Infinity War is the best Avengers film. So many character arcs all brought together in an epic battle that somehow does them all justice. Bringing the overarching villain, Thanos, into the picture raises the stakes and makes you feel the emotion of the characters. And of course, the ending is the most devastating cliffhanger since The Empire Strikes Back. While Endgame is an excellent way to conclude the Infinity Saga, Infinity War is ultimately its heart.",8
"Surreal, immeasurable, Epic.",27 April 2018,,7
Horrible ending... wish I would have waited for it to wind up on Redbox,29 April 2018,Movie was good until the ending. Absolutely sucked. I would have much rather had them make a 4-5 hour movie than have them leave it like they did. After that ending I'm not sure I care to watch anymore Marvel movies. And if I do ever watch more of them I'll wait until they're on Redbox or at my local library so that way I don't have to pay an arm and a leg to potentially suffer this kind of disappointment from a movie again.,4
Best MCU movie so far.,29 April 2018,"I was simply amazed by this movie and it had nothing to do with my low expectations caused by Age of Ultron or Ragnarok. The action starts in the first minutes and ends just before the credits roll up. Really good plot and even better characters. Like, they have made 3 Thor movies and the coolest Thor you will ever see is in this movie. Thanos is by far the best villain I have seen in any super-hero movie (MCU and DC). Just joking, no one will be better than Nolan's Joker :). But better than any villain MCU developed so far. My only regret is that Infinity War 2 didn't started right away, right there in the cinema. We'll have to wait one more year for that and I have a feeling that will be at least as good as this one. If you spend money in the past for Ant-Man, GOTG2 or any other slightly meaningless Marvel movie and think about skipping this one, trust me, you will regret it.

You have to see this movie as soon as possible.",10

A Marvel-ous GEM of a movie!,9 August 2018,"With action aplenty, Infinity War brings together so many story lines, so many of our childhood superheroes and delivers it in one fun-filled, often humorous, often poignant package.

Before reviewing, I decided to watch the movie again, and again.......and again! Hang on, I never watch movies four times, I just couldn't help myself with this one! And now I see why Infinity War is smashing records, and up there with some of my own all time classics such as Star Wars epIV, Godfather, Titanic, Saving Private ryan, Pulp Fiction and Gone with the Wind, yes, my genre tastes vary, and this proves just how Infinity War will be a future classic.

Now. The list of great actors and actresses goes on forever, each portraying their wonderfull characters flawlessly. It's often minor characters that steel the show; just watch Pom Klementieff's 'Mantis' and you'll smile. Of course Drax is another lovable Guardian, and let's not forget the classic Downey Jr lines or Hemsworth's top-notch portrayal of Thor. Watch out for cameos from Stan Lee, Samuel Jackson, Cobie Smulders and even Keneth Branagh gets in there too!

Now, you don't need to be a fan of the genre, or even totally up to date with Marvel, but background knowledge about the characters (Thor, Iron Man, Black Panther, Thanos, Vision, Dr Strange et al) and a brief understanding about what the Infinity Stones are (although this is actually briefly explained to us) will help.

What I like is that there are no uneccessary pointless plot twists, no pointless profanities and no over-the-top extended action fillers such as in LOTR. Everything falls into place, it's tidy and flows remarkably well. It's an easy-to-follow family movie.

My olny gripe? Everyone was well aware that this film was to see the demise of well-known and well-loved characters, but how in the (known) universe can we have lost beloved childhood superheroes forever? Really? Did we just witness the demise of major characters, (starting at the outset)? and, well,

what about that ending!

Puns intended, A Marvel-ous gem of a a movie that will last for infinity.",9
An epic tell : Best Avengers Ever,2 August 2018,Avengers always packed with actions and excitement . But this infinity war broke all of the records . Its the negative role played magnificently outstanding in this story . The human side of the greatest villain of time rise question about the harsh reality and defination of war . I think the God of the war stole the avengers sparks . The story tried to explain the balance of existence and told a epic story beyond writings and visualization .,10
"Good action throughout, some dumb choices",13 May 2018,"There was good action throughout this movie starting just a few minutes in and some moments of pretty funny humor. There were also a few obviously stupid choices by the characters that were obviously done that way so they could drag out the story to infinity and beyond. One was with Star Lord and another stupid choice was made by Thor. I won't say what they were but if you see the movie you will know. Anyway, I was a little disappointed in the movie overall. Hopefully the sequel is better. Hopefully there is only one sequel and they don't drag it out for 3 or 4 movies.",7

And the ending was horrible. Everyone around me in the theater seemed to have the same reaction. And the comments I heard afterwards seemed to echo my opinion. Sorry I rushed out to see it opening weekend. Won't be surprised if box office results drop dramatically next weekend as word of mouth gets around.",3
Best Marvel movie to date...,26 April 2018,My word - what an amazing treat it was ... can't wait till the next one. Didn't know how 149 minutes went. Was so glued to the screen and didn't want the movie to end. Jaw dropping climax with a little bit of emotions at the end.,10
Finally a superhero movie that can rival The Dark Knight,9 August 2018,"Infinity war's hype was huge. so much nobody thought it can live up to that. I myself was ready to be disappointed. Boy i was WRONG and i couldn't be more happy. Russo brothers nailed it. they made something seemingly impossible. putting all those heroes together without making it too crowded, and everyone of them has something to do. Action is great, acting is perfect, story is very good, CGI is impressive and Thanos is by far the best MCU villain ever created. focusing on Thanos help the movie to keep it together and preventing it from falling apart. everything spins around Thanos and his motivations and it's better this way. I was hooked to my chair when watching it, lots of surprise, shocking moments and perfectly directed. it deserve every penny you spend. DO NOT MISS THIS.",10

For comic and superhero movie fans... this is the best movie out there. and the best MCU movie so far. Amazing work.",10
In one word... AMAZING!!!,8 August 2018,"This movie will blow your mind, especially if you have seen the others and you know the back stories.

Infinity War is the Marvel version of Game of Thrones and it pays off,30 August 2018,"Avengers Infinity War is one of those rare gems where a movie exceeds your expectations. The action sequences and tge production design is phenomenal no surprise in that as its an MCU movie. Thanos is a fantastic villain, I despised his actions in the movie but there was something about the way his character was written that makes the audience know why his motives and they've shown him not necessarily a conflicted character but a character that has a certain level of humanity props to Josh Brolin for making Thanos believable and not some generic bad guy. This film really shocked me with some of the decisions and some of the character arks and I'm glad that it didn't go the safe route. Honestly I believe that this may very well be one of the best MCU movies and one of the best to come out this year. My only problem with the film is that the film didn't flow fluently which I get because there were so many subplots but that's the only issue I have. Lastly, the Russo brothers deserve the respect of every movie fan for putting together such an epic and grand movie and making it good.",7
Good but too bloated,6 May 2018,"OK I loved the sequel Age Of Ultron as it focused more on the Avengers themselves but I will get into the negatives later.

Avengers Infinity War is the prequel to the 2015 film and tells the story of the Avengers who are no longer working together and must try and defeat a giant half monster/ human called Thanos (Josh Brolin)who wants the stones known as the infinity stones. Each one makes Thano more powerful and it's up to the team to somewhat get back together and join the guardians of the galaxy(Chris Pratt, Zoe Salvada,Bradley Cooper). Will they stop Thano?

The special effects are very good along with the cinematography. However the film itself is 50/50 for me. The downside of this film was that there was too much going on and I was so dissapointed with the hulk played by Mark Ruffalo as you never see him as the hulk at all this time. Jermery Renner who played Hawkeye was absent in this and the film was so hard to follow e.g what happened to Thor's eye. I felt like it was skipping or whatever.

Overall do yourselves a favour and watch the 2015 version instead or try and watch all the Marvel films to get used to the story.

Also has Tom Holland,Robert Downey Jr,Gwyneth Paltrow,Don Cheadle,Chadwick Boseman,Karen Gillian and even a cameo by Stan Lee.",5

The birth of a Super Villain!,13 May 2018,"The birth of the first 'Super Villain' in Marvel universe just happened.

Finally someone who can really kick literally any superhero ass and walk away unscathed with élan. With every passing minute of the movie - you end up liking Thanos more and more. After the 'Civil war' - superheroes on earth are broken into pieces and scattered around earth - and the mightiest of all foes steps in to fight them in groups. The only superhero who really stands up to Thanos is Stark - and majestic as Thanos is , he respects Stark.

The movie - is a long but thoroughly enjoyable one. Guardians of galaxy step in and will have you chuckling every now and then - apart from the witty remarks of Stark and Spider-Man.

Highly recommended for the comic fans.

Most impressive superhero - Tony Stark. Least impressive superhero - Vision (he literally does nothing but lay around and lament)

Highlight and spotlight of the movie stolen by : Thanos!

PS: I like villains - not heroes.",9

A rollercoaster of emotions.,25 April 2018,"This is not epic. This is not cool or amazing. It's more than that. This film is everything. I got dragged from laughing to crying, from here till the other side of the universe and back. When I left the cinema today, I was blown away. No film has ever caught me like this.

Everyone should go to the cinema and enjoy the film there. Not only because they deserve it. But because of the experience you get. It's a rollercoaster. This film is so much better than the trailer, the trailer is like one percent of the whole film.

So much happening, so much things you forgot existed is there. So many people, so many plottwists. And Thanos. Boy. That man is insane.

Please go to the cinema, you won't be disappointed.

I wish I could tell you everything. I can't. Yet.

I don't know what to say about that masterpiece without spoilers. The plot is simple and good, visual, dialogues, action, acting, everything is at a high level. Ending is unpredictable and shocking. Main villain THANOS is a separate praise for the whole team who create him for this movie, he is terrifying and exciting at the same time, Just brilliant work

Just enjoy it!!!",8
I've been waiting this since 2008...,7 June 2018,"Epic. Emotional. Two and half hours of total excitement and when credits hit the screen, I was there hoping that second part of the movie were about to start. So sad I have to wait one more year for that. It was very dark with more of a serious tone. Darker than Winter Soldier which I love. The villain is finally here. The villain par excellence, Josh Brolin portrays the best villain in the MCU. In the beginning I hated Thanos. By the end of the movie I even felt sorry for him for a few seconds. They made him scary and strong at the same time vulnerable and understandable. For the most part, Infinity War does justice to the many heroes who have been assembled for the film. And there are a few standouts amongst all heroes. RDJ and Cumberbatch most of all.

The film ends even more bravely than it began. Final minutes were a stroke of bold narrative and so audacious. For a superheroes movie, 10/10.",10

Greifers Win Again,14 July 2018,,1
"Phew! They didn't stuff it up, but...",25 April 2018,"Okay, so I kinda have two initial reactions here. The first is that with all the hype, sheer number of characters, cross-over story lines and preceding history I was worried that the Russo brothers would miss the mark and at the very least deliver a shonky mess. In my opinion they didn't and as a result, as a fan of comics, the MCU and movies in general, I came out of the cinema feeling that I had seen a well balanced, by-the-fans-for-the-fans, culmination of work that satisfied me on most levels.

But as Austin Powers said ""Having said that, I do have some thoughts...""

When Avengers 3 & 4 were announced years ago, along with a plethora of other movies in the MCU, they were subtitled Part 1 & 2 respectively. Then some time ago, next years ""Part 2"" was adjusted to ""Untitled Avengers Movie"", leaving us with the feeling that this one would wrap up the current Infinity Gems story-line and that the fourth installment would be a completely new direction/ adventure for the team. Without giving away the ending, this movie does leave it open for resolution in next years Avengers 4, and I can understand given the known history of this story in the comics that the studio wanted to try and maintain some of the element of surprise for us diehard fans. So for their efforts in that department, I thank you.

On a final note, I'm aware that this is not Ben Hur, The Godfather, Shawshank Redemption etc. It isn't meant to be of that calibre. It does hit the mark right where it is supposed to, with only a few minor wobbles along the way and that, my friends, is pretty darn good in this day and age.",9

Good visual effect,9 June 2020,"This is my first Marvel movie, not quite my type. Stars for the visual and sound effect.",7
Destiny has arrived...,28 April 2018,"After a decade of spectacular films and cast of characters, the culmination of the entire MARVEL Cinematic Universe has led to this. 'Avengers: Infinity War' marks the first-half of what is to be a monumental cinematic event. With years of hype, does this film deliver and meet every expectation we've been hoping for?

1. This review is SPOILER FREE , but there will be mentions of certain sequences, however, I assure you there won't be any reveals. To make things simple, the mad titan Thanos (Josh Brolin) has finally decided to scour the universe in a hunt for all six infinity stones and deliver a balance to life and death that he sees fit. Blood will be shed and fear spreads as a fractured Avengers face their greatest threat as the fate of the world hangs in the balance. In all honesty, this film delivered on everything I wanted to see all whilst exceeding my expectations at the same time. One must remember that to fully appreciate this film, you had to have seen every MCU film prior to this. If you've missed films in between or if this in your first MCU experience, I'd heavily recommend that you catch up as soon as you can before seeing 'Infinity War' because you'd be utterly confused viewing this on its own.

2. Although all the characters are in one film, they're not all together (if you know what I mean). Certain Avengers are handling things in different places across the galaxy, so don't expect a unified team-up on this one. Everything has its place and I continue to stress that this is part one of two in the 'Infinity War' and Thanos' story. The three leading heroes (Captain America, Iron Man & Thor) are all on their respective quests until the ultimate convergence during the climax. Personally, the more intriguing story was Captain America's (Chris Evans) quest and the defensive actions in Wakanda, as well as Gamora's (Zoe Saldana) relationship with her adopted father Thanos. Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) and the Guardians' plot is a close second while Thor's (Chris Hemsworth) was the least compelling. Not to say having three different story-lines is a bad thing, rather than which is more entertaining to follow.

3. Thanos is by far the greatest CGI creation I've seen come alive on-screen since Gollum. The effects are impeccable and Josh Brolin delivers an outstanding motion-capture performance as the mad Titan himself. There is an ere of sympathy to Thanos that I found interesting and all credit goes to the writers. He is (most certainly) a force to be reckoned with and can definitely be placed in the category of the greatest cinematic villains in history. What was equally impressive were Thanos' minions/followers, 'The Black Order'. Corvus Glaive, Proxima Midnight, Ebony Maw & Cull Obsidian respectively, are badass characters all of whom I'm dying to see more of. The action is spectacular and some of which I've never seen before. It was hard to contain my inner nerd the more the movie progressed closer and closer to that spectacular climax. So as far as action goes......no complaints whatsoever.

4. The one thing I found a little campy and I guess the only flaw of this film is that Vision (Paul Bettany) and Scarlett Witch's (Elizabeth Olsen) relationship. As seen in the trailers, Vision has evolved to the point in which he can now generate a human appearance. It's insinuated that both he and Wanda are intimate (having sex), and that's just awkward and somewhat gross to think about considering Vision is still a robot/machine of sorts despite his intellect. Besides that, I must warn audiences who've been spoiled by the happy/hopeful/humorous MCU endings thus far, because 'Infinity War' has a rather dark ending. When it was all over, I was unable to move from my seat and just sat there for a few minutes to wrap my head around the final event and realization of the films climax. Its somewhat of a cliffhanger but not entirely, because the film does have a legit conclusion.

I felt fear and shed tears for certain characters as there is so much emotion tied into this film. Some sequences are truly heartbreaking despite the amazing action and moments of humor. Kudos to the direction of the Russo brothers and writers Markus & McFeeley, because 'Avengers: Infinity War' is truly one for the ages and a spectacle of a film. It it so fantastic that MARVEL has indeed succeeded the likes of DC and even Star Wars, as this is easily in the higher rankings of best comic-book films ever made.",9

Does this sound like every other Marvel CU movie ever? Yep. Like I said in the title, if you're 12 years old you would probably rate this high. Scar Jo and Falcon are the absolute worst characters. I won't give it a 1 star, but I definitely will not rate it higher than a 3.",3

Ofcourse it's going to be tongue in cheek over top action. But it does it perfectly. Greatest movie of its genre and also has a bit of soul. The CGI and cast alone give it a 5 star rating. Then the movie itself rounds it off a ten. Yes ten as it doesn't put a foot wrong. Ignore the 1's. And 2's as they are just morons. Watch this movie but I'm guessing if you are reading this you already have.",10
Good but if I ever have to watch Tom Holland cry again I swear,8 July 2018,"I loved this movie and I saw it twice in the cinema. It was the third movie to make me cry. The other 2 were Wonder Woman and Love, Simon if that gives anything to go by. Good movie would recommend.",10
The Avengers are back - and in the best way possible.,13 May 2018,"I've heard Avengers: Infinity War paralleled with Empire Strikes Back - not a bad comparison. Fantastic movie. If it's not the best Marvel has made, its definitely one of them. If you liked the original Avengers movie, this one will blow your mind. It's so great to see everyone together, to have Thor with the Guardians, to watch Iron Man and Spider-Man fight alongside Quill and Doctor Strange. I've seen this twice already, and I'll be seeing this yet again for sure. The wait for Captain Marvel and Avengers 4 is gonna be harder than ever. Times cried: 2",10
Takes your breath away!,18 May 2018,"This is the movie I've been waiting for ever since Thanos was shown at the end of ""The Avengers"" and it was worth the wait. War is right because there is so much action, funny, sad but worth every second. Though I would have expected it to be a little bit more serious in the matter since Thanos is trying to wipe off half the population. Bubbles was not necessary for this film either and the Black Order was not as powerful as I would expect them to be. In all though a fantastic film with such a great villain in Thanos. He lives up to his nickname the ""Mad Titan"" and he's basically the main character in this film since he has character build up than any other character in the film. If there is any superhero movie to be seen this year it is this one none can come close to this amazing film!!",9
Best Superhero Film So Far,22 May 2018,"This movie threw out all the flaws people complain about in regards to the MCU: Low stakes Deaths don't matter Doppelgänger villains Forgettable villains

This movie has incredible performances from just about everyone in it, but most notably Josh Brolin, Tom Holland, and Robert Downs Jr. This film isn't just a film, it's an experience. It has so many unforgettable moments that will make you laugh, cry, and cheer. And it's the darkest Marvel film yet. Maybe even the darkest superhero film yet. And it doesn't try too hard to be dark and edgy like the DC films. What makes the Marvel films so great is how relatable and human the superheroes are, and the sacrifices they make to save their fellow people. Yeah, it's a high budget summer blockbuster with a ton of special effects and CGI, but that doesn't not take away the fact that it's a great movie with fantastic writing and A+ Acting.",10

A Comic Booky Romp with a Ton of Characters,30 August 2018,"The is one of the best movies in the MCU line up, based purely on a storytelling and action. The villain(s) are great and the visuals are astounding. However on a personal level I lost a lot of enjoyment based solely on who was more of a main character than who. A lot of the characters I find annoying or boring had more time to do things in this movie than those I enjoy. Also Ebony Maw was dispatched too quickly. Movie loses its appeal the more time passes.

Personal Enjoyment Score (IMDb): 6/10 Movie Score (LetterBoxd): 7/10",6
Spiderman is NOT Ironman's sidekick!!!!,28 April 2018,"I really really hate what MCU is doing with Spider-Man. Whenever they do popularity vote on all the superheroes, Spider-Man always comes in 3rd behind Superman and Batman. Which makes him the most popular Marvel superhero. Yet MCU just turns him into a whiny sidekick of Ironman who constantly seeks his approval. And the suit all made by Tony Stark. Come on man. This is ""THE"" Spider-Man. This is why I hated Homecoming too. They're destroying Spider-Man.

I still can't understand a word Chadwick says and he still can't act.

Other than that, I enjoyed it. I liked the fact that they put more personality and character to Thanos and he's not just mindless destroyer like most villains. I don't like how the movie's ending leaves you hanging but I think it was necessary to display the power of the Infinity Gauntlet.

Few other disappointment was no Adam Warlock and Hawkeye. Not sure if Warlock will appear on next one... although writers confirmed he wont be. But they showed the teaser of him at end of GG vol2 post-credit scene and have him omitted for Infinity War is a crime.",8
This is not the best Superhero movie of all time!,28 April 2018,"Avengers Infinity War is a good movie that continues to make the same plot mistakes and the same abuse of comedy. For a story arc as important as Thanos's, this joke takes away seriousness and in no time you connect with that threat. The action scenes are very good and the CGI excellent although it also has moments in which it is very bad ... if you do not see Bruce Banner inside the Hulk Buster so that they realize. An entertaining movie but full of empty plot and I'm telling you that NO, it's not the best superhero movie in history as they do not try to sell it, it's not even the best Marvel movie to date, that's what Iron Man is for 1, Captain America Winter Soldier and the first of Avengers that are still better, much less is on par with the great movie of Nolan The Dark Knight as they try to make us believe too, that is still the best superhero movie ever created. My rating is a 6.5 out of 10.",6
Awful,5 May 2018,,1
Changes the definition of Epic,28 April 2018,"It's possibly the most ambitious movie I've ever seen.

Celebrating 10 years of the Marvel cinematic universe, Infinity war has everyone in it. all the Avengers all the Guardians of the Galaxy, spider-man, Doctor Strange. It is overstuffed with comic book characters, but I did not find it overwhelming. I was more exciting to see all these characters do a team up. I will say that some characters got more screen time than others. some characters you think would dominate the movie did not and some characters you never thought were that important show you that's not the case.

Josh Brolin as Thanos was an exceptional villain. the best these movies have to offer. As the Avengers and their allies attempt to stop Thanos from killing the universe, the character goes on this strange Lord of the Rings-like journey to find the infinity Stones, turning this Superhero movie into a Fantasy film.

Too slow at times as we get to know all the Avengers over again, and we also had to follow three different stories that sometimes drag, but everything is made up for with Thanos, who put this movie on a new level of drama.",9
As good as it gets for an MCU film,25 April 2018,"I had my worries going into this movie, as I know from experience that too much hype usually ends up with an empty feeling of what could have been. The Last Jedi for example.

But in short, this movie was everything and more than I could have hoped for. The scale of characters, the visuals and the truthfulness to previous plot points was perfectly balanced. As all things should be. Thanos is an absolute monster in this film, and while I disagree on Marvel stating that he may be our generation's equivalent of Darth Vader, he is definitely THE heavyweight of the MCU. I'm usually not the overly emotional movie-goer, but I caught myself shedding tears twice in the third act, which emphasizes the potent writing and vision from Feige, the Russos and Markus + McFeely.

The humour is near perfect, with a single joke from Drax being a little off. Otherwise the humour doesn't feel misplaced, especially with the Guardians providing a lot of great comic relief.

Most importantly, this movie gives the MCU what it has needed for 18 movies now: Consequence. When a movie like ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" or ""Guardians of the Galaxy"", you think that a character is killed off, but then revived in the end of the movie. Civil War had hints of consequence for the main characters, but not anything spectacular. This, however, has consequence written all over it. The first 10 minutes is a clear sign of what kind of movie to expect.

I was fortunate enough to watch this movie in IMAX, which I recommend everyone with intentions of watching this movie to do.

I'm giving this movie 10/10 all because it has been able to live up to the massive hype and at the same time delivering an evil, dark, funny, but at the same time self-aware movie. And most importantly: Everything's at stake.",10
A THRILL RIDE FROM START TO FINISH,28 April 2018,"This film, is about the avengers trying to stop the unstoppable force of Thanos, from destroying half if the universe.

This film is directed by Anthony Russo (Captain America: The Winter Soldier) and Joe Russo (Captain America: The Winter soldier). It has a huge cast, which include Robert Downey Jr. (Iron Man), Chris Hemsworth (The Avengers) and Mark Ruffalo (The Avengers). To name a few.

I love this film, I don't think it is as good as Black Panther, simply because Black Panther destroyed all my expectations, to be absolutely brilliant, Whilst this lived up to my hype, so I didn't have as much of a payoff. But that is the only reason why. The Russo brothers deliver yet again a beautiful film, with much less shaky cam than there other 2 MCU films. all of the performances are great, but the stand out is defiantly Josh Brolin (No country for old men) as the big bad Thanos. Everything about this film is absolutely fantastic, Watch it!

So far this year, Marvel has knocked it out the park. First Black Panther now this. Fingers crossed for Ant-Man and The Wasp.

Not bad but top 25th movie of all time?,3 August 2018,"Not getting into the plot but definitely overhyped. The magic of the 1st avengers definitely lost, maybe intentionally done so but some of the acting and script seems forced. I can not think of one wow moment. CGI is great but overall the movie felt empty and without heart, again could be intentional. Let's see what part 2 brings.",7
"Triumphant,",24 August 2018,"Avengers: Infinity War is a fantastic movie with a very well developed plot and a tremendous cast. This really does break new boundaries that have never been crossed with a Marvel movie, or any superhero film for that matter. From the very first scene, we are pulled in, we are made aware that this film is bold, daring, that the stakes have been risen to the max and the circumstances are dire. It genuinely had me at the edge of my seat, the atmosphere in the theatre was phenomenal, as we reacted and shared the journey with one another, it was a film experience I will not soon forget.

The movie also deseves to be applauded for how seamlessly it manages to combine all these franchises in to the one, it never felt overstuffed somehow, I never got lost, and, what it especially deseves credit for, never felt any one of the Avengers, Guardians of the Galaxy, Black Panther, Doctor Strange or Spider-Man were under utilized in any way, everyone got a good amount of screen time and a solid arc.

One of the film's highlights is, without any doubt, Josh Brolin as Thanos, he completely knocks it out of the park as this intimidating, petrifying character that we know from the get go is going to put all of our favourite superheroes in jeopardy. He had me both trembling and riveted every time he is on screen, and I was amazed with the turn the Russo brothers took in actually getting us to somehow sympathise and see a little eye to eye with a character that so easily could have been presented as just a villain.

All around tremendous. Entertaining, action packed, funny at times, suspenseful at others, Avengers: Infinity War is a film that needs to be seen on the big screen, it is a sight for sore eyes and it does not let down one bit.

The Avengers face their biggest challenge yet as they learn of Thanos, who has his hands on the Infinity Gauntlet and will stop at nothing to collect all six Infinity stones, which would render him unstoppable.

Best Performance: Josh Brolin",10
Good flick,1 November 2018,"The action and the effects were all first class. The story line was filled with holes and questions. For an action packed movie it was awesome but it didn't offer very many intelligent twist. Thanos wasn't the cool hearted killer I was led to believe from the other movies, he was calm and focused. Most of the aggression can from the Avengers. Even Dr Strange tossed out civility and went straight to violence. At the end of the movie I found myself asking the question, ""Who were the real villains here?"" I enjoy fantasy movies and this one is good enough to watch again but only for the action and effects, the writers left out a lot of info that would justify the violence of the Avengers but hey, that's Hollywood.",7
Less and Less fun ... each time!,14 July 2018,,1
1/10 ratings are utter nonsense,24 May 2018,"I don't have a problem with people rating this film with less than 10/10. But people say the 10/10 ratings are bogus reviews, and yet, the 1/10 are listed as ""Most Helpful?"" Ridiculous. For a movie to have a 1/10 vote, you'd have to watch it with your eyes and ears shut and only know the name of the film, and the name sucks. And those reviewers probably don't realize why the movie is called ""Infinity War"" perhaps thinking that the war goes on for infinity (and beyond, HAH!).

Qualifications for an only decent story, film: Does it have character development? Check. This movie 10 years worth of character development. Any plot/story? Check. If you don't know who the villains are or who the heroes are, and what they are fighting for, you live in belly lint. At any point did the audience react to a scene the way the filmmaker intended? Check. If you didn't at least smile once from an intended pun, or feel anger or sadness, or even humor during a fight scene with a well-known established character, then you don't know the character at all after 10 years.

So this movie must then qualify as at least ""decent"" and a 1/10 review is not a ""decent"" rating, and yet those reviews are labelled/ordered as ""most helpful.""

Reviewers commented about the setup for the story and how some main characters die and some live to move the story along, have you EVER written a story? Would YOU kill off most of the main characters in the beginning of your story? Who then would want to read/watch your story? If those deaths are too convenient for you in that it is a plot device to move a story along, that still doesn't make for a 1/10 rating. When someone gets stabbed, death sometimes is not immediate, even in the heart. Someone has to die, in Thanos' eyes he doesn't want to kill everyone, just who he needs to in order to get what he wants. You may think Thanos is a fool for wanting to kill off half the universe, but to Thanos it makes total sense. Villains don't always kill for the sake of killing, don't always create chaos for the sense of anarchy. Sometimes they do villainous things thinking it is for the greater good, as wrong as they may be.

Ultimately, reader, don't believe the ""hype"" of the 1/10 reviews. See it for yourself, judge for yourself. You'll be glad you did.",10

You didn't see THAT coming?,28 April 2018,"I am a person who has never read the comics, but has fallen in love with the films. And it has to be said with this particular universe, all of the filmmakers have transformed what were either unlikable or one dimensional heroes and villains into fully fledged, lovable, three dimensional characters. They make you care for these people - which is why this film works extraordinarily well.

This movie is many things: extremely relentless, fast-paced, funny, heartbreaking and action packed. And contains one of the most jaw-dropping endings I've ever seen. When a mass-market appeal blockbuster is totally invested in consequences, storylines and character arcs, as well as taking big risks, I absolutely love it and wish more movies had the balls to do it.

That being said, there is a small part of me that wished I wasn't so geeked out and in love with the characters. But it's too late, as Doctor Strange says at one point, ""We are in the endgame, now.""

The filmmakers did right, they didn't joke about and they meant it when people should not spoil the movie.

Go and see it.",8

Should stay closer to the Comic Book story telling,5 May 2018,"A very good attempt. The Marvel movies of today come closer to the strengths of comic books story telling: complex stories told on many narrative strings summing up to big finals. Digital art of today can provide the means to bring actors in real-live superheros feeling. A lot of this movie is to be liked. But the Marvel team should go back - one more time - to study further the story telling of the comic books. All good drawn stories do not go on with action scenes over pages and pages. That would be to boring and page-wasting for the reader. Action itself is done within very few pictures in comic books. One ""wham!"" and one ""peng!"". That's it. Nobody is interested in 10 pages of ""wham"" and ""peng!"". The needed action scenes are shortened in comic books (the fantasy of the reader jumps in) and the won comic book frames can be filled with in-between stories of love, hate, relation, politics, kisses, needings and longings of human beings universal told with the over-aggregated means of superheros. So please, reduce the time wasted on action scenes. Stay closer with the tellings of comic books. With each step the Marvel and the DC-teams go closer to the art of the telling in comic books, the better the movies have become. In Infinity War the grandios final would have been still more grandios with a reduction of the battle scenes to an absolute minimum. The first comic-movie that will dare to use an absolute minimum of time for battle scenes will come up with fantastic stories, I am sure.",7
Pretty Awesome!,21 August 2018,"I would love to give this a 9.9 star rating! The only reason I took the 0.1 star off is because I hate that it just left me hanging!! It is torture! Can't wait to see what happens next. If you love Guardians of the Galaxy and the Thor movies, which are the only movies I am familiar with, you are going to have enough knowledge to love this. I don't know anything about Iron Man, Captain America, Dr Strange or Black Panther and I still loved this. Check it out.",9
A Surprisingly Strong Action Romp,5 May 2018,"I'm just gonna come out and say this: from an action, ""popcorn"" perspective, Infinity War is a mesmerising spectacle that sucks you right in until the credits roll after its deceptively long 2hr 29min running time. As someone who has seen many (but isn't a diehard fan) of the Marvel films, I was pleasantly surprised at the ways in which such a colossal picture manages to invest in its myriad of characters, backstories and locations.

The plot is very simple, but the Russo brothers do a fantastic job at enthralling viewers with what is essentially Thanos's search for the 6 infinity stones that tie the different film universes together. Scenes are snappy and fluid, with dialogue kept to a bare minimum of character introductions and brief exchanges of quippy one-liners. There's a fair dose of ""Marvel"" humour running throughout that many will enjoy, but personally I found some of the more contrived lines a bit painful to listen to. Thankfully, this is resolved by the truly awesome spectacle of near-constant action that unfolds - the sequences evolve rapidly and shift between multiple locations, giving you a true sense of the scale of the film without feeling detached from its events. The final third in particular contains some of the best sequences I've ever seen in a superhero movie.

There are many, many standout performances in this film. As ever, Robert Downey Jr puts in a great shift as a Tony Stark still traumatised by the previous films, but also reprising his role of mentor to Tom Holland's Spiderman - who steals the limelight as the franchise's newest, funniest and tear-jerking new avenger. Benedict Cumberbatch also puts in a stellar shift in reprising his role of Doctor Strange, but the film's strongest performance by far is Josh Brolin's voice portrayal of Thanos. I had a lot of trepidation going into this film about how ""shallow"" Thanos as a villain was going to be, but Brolin delivers an emotional roller-coaster leaving us torn between fear, hatred, sympathy, and even a grudging respect for the MCU's biggest bad boy. Thanos is given a fantastic emotional arc that really encourages sympathy and makes him a far more three-dimensional character shown to suffer almost as much as the heroes do.

Infinity War is an ambitious step up for the Marvel franchise - yes the plot is basic, but the scale is so large that it has to be. The film stays true to its focus on delivering pure, unbridled super-hero action, and this is helped by its huge web of complex characters that interact with one another to make this the richest, most intricate Marvel film yet and a strong start to the next chapter of the Avengers story.",7

Avengers: Infinity War is a decade culmination of strategic cinematic building with triumphant results.,26 April 2018,"10 years since 'Iron Man' commenced the cinematic universe. 10 years. Just let that sink in. Now, the superhero soap opera draws closer to its conclusion and the stakes are higher than ever. The Avengers, Guardians and a myriad of supporting heroes encounter the wrath of the villainous Thanos. They must unite and prevent him from harnessing all six infinity stones, because if he does...we all know what will happen. Total universal annihilation! With each chapter, the MCU becomes more and more predicable as the narrative follows the exact same three act structure. Whilst there is a tiny sense of predictability here, the sheer boldness of the Russo brothers' execution has made for an excitingly tense blockbuster that I'm sure will leave many in awe with what they just witnessed. The colossal enormity of this chapter, the raging pressure for the directors, the astronomical expectation from the fans, all immeasurable factors that somehow have been measured and implemented to create heroic entertainment. The intricate balance of all the superheroes felt like an impossible task, however each member received enough screen time to validate their presence within the story. All the actors performed with sincerity, particularly during the more emotional moments. Finally we are presented with a multi-dimensional antagonist who's motives, may unquestionably be evil, are nonetheless relatable. You see his perspective. The inclusion of Thanos' backstory and the focus on the ferocious power of the Infinity Gauntlet cements him as the strongest adversary within the MCU. Impressive visual effects and memorable action set pieces ensures the thrills are consistently imaginative throughout. It's certainly a behemoth, where the narrative's pacing is slightly inconsistent during the first half and the humour misses more than it hits, but with such confident direction they have made an impossible chapter possible. Geeks, fans and film lovers, rejoice! However that ending though, left me speechless...",8

It's an Amazing movie.,25 April 2018,"I didn't see ALL that coming! It's a AMAZING movie. Not like all the superhero movies before, this one is spectacular. I think they should have considered to tilte this movie ""Thanos: Infinity War."" However, if they really did that, less audience would come see this move as most people come in the name of ""Avengers""",10
I was shocked at how good this movie was,2 May 2018,"Im generally a fan of superhero movies... the well written ones. But i didnt think they could pull this movie off. Too many superheros. Trying to toss in everyone you can to expand the $$$ base. They were becoming formulaic (insert next villain here. superhero gets cocky... is taken down..gets humble.. defeats generic supervillain x).

But this movie was wow. It tosses all those conventions out the window. It's funny but it doesnt toss easy predictable snark at you. EVERY hero in this movie needs to be there. And all the best things about them are there. In the case of Cap.. well he just seems to get more awesome while maintaining his true superpower - always doing the right thing.. regardless. And Stark is more human than ever.. i was concerned they were making him a caricature. These are people who are used to being superior to every human.. facing a literal god. Whos minions are near gods themselves. Imagine the avengers facing 2 of Thanos minions.. and you sitting there pretty sure they cant defeat them. Or even one.

And the very best.. and most horrific part i cant tell you. This movie is brilliant.. and the next one will break every box office record recorded.. regardless of whether it is good or not. Go watch it. You will love it.

Note: a few critics trying to be hipstercool are trashing this movie. If they are.. you know who not to read anymore. Theyre literally , conciously trying to be too cool for school by not liking an absolutely brilliant movie",9
"terrific movie except for the ""ending""",24 August 2018,,8
"I watched it yesterday,",19 January 2022,,6
"10 years, 18 movies...it delivered.",27 April 2018,"I've been waiting for this film since 2008 when Nick Fury showed up in Tony Stark's house telling him he's apart of a bigger universe and he just doesn't know it.

The pacing is relentless. Not a boring moment. It was basically three third acts all together. I was surprised to see it even escalate further than I expected. Being a huge comic-book geek, I was pleased to see the film go to places where I thought it wouldn't. I definitely thought Marvel would play it just a little safe before Avengers 4, but they didn't.

So with that being said, lets start with Thanos. Josh Brolin's Thanos is the MCU's best villain by far, beating out Loki, Winter Soldier, Vulture, Killmonger, and Zemo. Also for a CGI creature, he looked legit. Unlike Steppenwolf, the way the light hits his face, the subtle movements on his face when he expresses himself, his movement, it was just perfection. There are some moments where it's not too polished, but it's not completely distracting. Compared to the comics, the Russo Brothers, Kevin Feige and writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely take some liberties to make Thanos more than just a big villain who wants to destroy the world. In his own sick and twisted point of view, he kinda had a point, and the best villains are the ones who think that they're doing the right thing.

At this point if any of you have been following the MCU or at least watched a good portion, you won't be totally lost. The entire cast brought their A-game and came to play. Some characters take a back seat, but they do get their moment to shine and are used very well in service of the plot. Downey Jr. And Cumberbatch have great snarky, prick-like, know-it-all vs. Know-it-all back and forth. Holland, Pratt, Bautista, Mackie, Cooper, Diesel, and Ruffalo bring some levity. Evans and Hemsworth bring it in the action department and at this point they can play Cap and Thor in their sleep. We also get a nice cameo from a character we haven't seen in a while. You'll know who I'm talking about once you see the film.

Kudos for Markus and McFeely for juggling this behemoth. One can make the argument that it can get confusing, but if you're invested as much as I am, then it's a total breeze. With 18 movies in, Infinity War can't afford to bring you up to speed.

I normally find romance in superhero films a drag, but here Infinity War juggles two of them and they work really well. I found that the Vision and Scarlet Witch romance was quite effective. Star-Lord and Gamora worked well also.

Action sequences and special effects are top notch. I know a lot of VFX artists worked day and night and they really did not miss a beat. Like Thanos, some weren't as polished, but it's not to the point where it's so obvious. The battle sequences in Titan and Wakanda are back to back edge of your seat thrill rides. I particularly geeked out in the Titan sequence where Thanos does have a one on one with Doctor Strange and Iron Man. Kudos for the creative team to allow Thanos to go nuts with his Infinity Gauntlet. That was such a treat.

Thanos solves Marvel's villain problem. He got a lot of screen time to be developed and being a fan I wasn't disappointed. I love that I felt a sense of danger. As much as I love the MCU, the criticism of no stakes and weak villains for some of their films are valid. For the first time in a while, we actually feel fear for these characters and it's awesome.

If I had one negative, and that's really all I have, is that perhaps the Black Order, or the Children of Thanos are nothing more than just henchmen. They are primarily new characters introduced in the Infinity storyline back in 2013. I did not expect to get what writer Jonathan Hickman gave us in the source material they're based off of, so I kept my expectations in check, but I really did think we'd get a little more to who they are all about. Out of the four, only Ebony Maw truly impressed me and had the most to do.

Avengers: Infinity War is everything I could have hoped for. It's definitely in my Top 3 list of MCU films, and in my Top 10 comic-book films of all time. Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige and directors Joe & Anthony Russo did not pull any punches with this one. It pulled my heart out, making some bold choices along the way. I love their tone as they bring intensity, knowing when to be serious and knowing when to sprinkle in a little humor here and there.

It's a grim and bleak time for the Avengers and the Guardians. The sense of danger makes all the difference in this film. If any of you haven't seen it, you're all not ready for what's to come. Consequences are real and the stakes are high. I will definitely be seeing this again in theaters and I'm so thankful that Avengers 4 is only a year wait as opposed to two or three.

Remember to also stay after the credits.

Nice but desapointed...,6 May 2018,"SPOILER: The action and special effects are terrific, I loved it. But I was waiting so much of this movie... the end of 10 years expectations ! The characters, except Thanos, they are so dull... they don't get the chance to interact as they're use to. There is so many characters that the humour is just about childish jokes, no real talk, not even subtil humour for the end of the univers... after all why don't we laugh when our friend and everybody are diying or going to die",6
Don't.,2 September 2018,"Yep, you heard me....Just don't. If you love these characters, were hooked on the previous movies, *don't.* If you deal with anxiety, panic, depression, or anything else, *don't.* This movie is not like the others, and honestly, does not show much screen time for most the characters. It is much more violent and emotional than the previous films, but more than that, it is extremely disturbing. Basically, if you feel obligated to view it for your favorite characters, just beware, there's not much screen time for them, so don't push yourself, or feel like you have to do it. Also, I would definitely NOT take kids to see this, as the movie has a very dark and disturbing atmosphere to it.",1
"Infinity War 2, How Long Are Gonna Wait",25 April 2018,"I must say after coming out I thought more about what I just seen, than any of the other movies in MCU.

It's a really well thought out plot, with lots of twists that are full of more action and fighting, than any of the other Avengers movie.

In regards to the amount of characters in the movie it can be at times a little overwhelming and doesn't give much room for the details of characters that you may have learned to love.

Thanos gets more screen time, than any of the other main characters, and maybe rightfully so. Thanos has never properly had a back story, like the others and evidently steals the movie. Josh Brolin dominates the show with his performance and was perfectly cast. His companions and henchmen could have also had more screen time or have been introduced before now.

The ending was not in any way predictable and very ballsy. Plus, one or two too many jokes for my taste, but I understand why they done it.

A solid 9 and ranks very highly in Marvel Cinema Universe.",9
Cannot understand the poor reviews,21 June 2018,"This film is absolutely epic! Reading the reviews above I get the sense that these reviewers who didn't get it weren't really invested in all the build up since the first avengers movie. Let's be Clear here, this film delivers on every level. From the opening jaw dropping scene that sets the tone of what Thanos is about, to culmination of each character and franchise. Seeing Tony Stark trade egos with Dr Strange and star lord and to see captain America back in his less than 'boy scout' attire was growth enough and I don't think the story needed to spell out anymore than we'd already seen.

I haven't had my head blown off like this since the first avengers movie and The Dark Knight before that.

If you can appreciate its loyalty to the original material and its beautiful narrative for the big screen then I think you're going to witness a masterpiece and also the best movie of the year.",10
"The Boldest, Most Courageous, Most intelligent twist in the Cinematic history",13 May 2018,"Yep, I said it, Many people are pissed upon watching the movie, and I understand the emotions there (No spoilers) but Jeez, Infinity War had me with a throbbing heart (even after the third time watching it)

First of all, the Plot is brilliant, it broke down easily on the first time with few details I had to revisit the second and the third time, but it is brilliant, the movie did it boldly, and did it like no other super hero movie, One can say that giving the trends of Marvel movies plots, but this is like the highest you can go with stakes in a movie, it must be a gamble and yes it was for the directors I get why the ending was not everyone's favorite, but come on, there is a sequel, and the end is not what we would all expect, the ending was literally the last thing anyone thought, I feel like the directors did know what we were thinking and definitely surprised the hell out of us, but in all honesty, kuddos to the Russos, for interconnecting, engineering and building this masterpiece of a culmination, making all movies, all stories and all characters flow to this plot. Second, Thanos, he has got to be like the longest for them to develop, to build a character so complex in his own thinking yet so simple in his feelings, building a villain is really hard, but creating a villain with a balance was plausible. Third, the production of this movie deserves 100 out of 10, the Visual effects are stunning, the action scenes are astronomical, the pace and the combustible stakes are just INSANE, I was really thinking wait How far can you take this and they did, take it to the highest extremes, I usually am very critical of production issues in a movie but this was remarkable Last, the actors have all been, without a doubt at their finest, Chris Evans is at his best, Downey was at his best, Vision was amazing, Ebony Maw was one of the most phenomenal characters, Hemsworth was sooooo EPIC, Pratt was at his best, Zoe Saldana did deliver memorably, Iron Man VS Dr Strange was one of the best chemistry on screen ever, which is usually a hard thing to do in a movie like this, and THANOS, my god that guy roared, breathed, cried and smirked like a VILLAIN, Brolin deserves at least multiple nominations for this

Here is the summary for you, Avengers Infinity war is a SEQUEL, it stands by itself from a plot but is still dependant on what happened prior to it, A Masterpiece of acting, Chemistry, production and well engineered story, it is bold, it defies our expectations and it is pushing it towards Avengers 4 at a 200 Miles an hour, CAN'T WAIT!!!",10

Thanos stands out beyond our expectations. As there many characters, this makes them less special. Many characters dies unexpectedly.

I would have to say that it is the best movie from Marvel's Studio. I loved Thano's characters so long after the Joker from The Dark Knight.

I'm not a superheroes-flick fanboy. But this was fun to watch.,14 August 2018,"Smile. For even in death, you have become Children of Thanos.

Me and superheroes. We have a kind of love-hate relationship. One moment I'm really enjoying the character or the story. At that time jealousy bubbles up and I wished I had those specific powers in my daily life. And sometimes I have absolutely no feelings about the superhero or I find the story not so fascinating. I surely can enjoy a Hulk movie because of the devastating power this superhero possesses. From ""Spiderman"", I like that youthful enthusiasm that Peter Parker radiates when discovering his new power. And in ""The Guardians of the Galaxy"", I appreciated the humor. Finally, ""Deadpool"" and ""Ant-man"" were refreshing. But when I watched ""Thor: Ragnarok"", I simply fell asleep. ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" I found so terribly confusing. After 20 minutes I no longer understood what it was about. And the whole ""X-men"" universe left me indifferent because of the lack of affinity I have with this club. It will be due to my not so great interest in superheroism. And every time, I come to the conclusion that all those superheroes are connected in one way or another, which makes it look like a web of facts and events.

But ""Avengers: Infinity war"" was entertaining. First of all, because a large part of the Marvel clan appears in it. It's like a grand finale of all Marvel heroes. Together they try to join forces to prevent Thanos (Josh Brolin) from grabbing the six Infinity stones, so he can destroy half of the population in the universe with the snap of a finger. A simplistic idea of this super-villain to make life more pleasant on overcrowded planets. A purple environmental activist. He quickly gets hold of the first stones. However, the other two remaining stones are on Earth and require a little more effort from Thanos because they are surrounded by the remaining superheroes. What follows are sometimes hallucinating-looking battles and superhuman confrontations. As we are used to from the Marvel clan.

I have to admit it. I was able to follow the story without difficulties (and that might have something to do with my age). Usually, the story isn't so clear for someone without much knowledge about this world of superheroes. You could even call the film exciting. That's no self-evident fact when it concerns unbeatable superheroes with unprecedented forces who seldom fear to be defeated. And you know they are going to use the well-known trick of resurrecting the seemingly defeated hero. Even though the situation seems hopeless, you can be sure that one of the heroes will put his butt on an intergalactic toilet where, after the necessary superhero-pushing, he'll produce some super weapon with which they shrink the bad guy to the size of a smurf, such that the universe is again saved from a catastrophe.

To keep things simple, they've split the whole into a number of different storylines in different locations where a group of heroes each has their own fish to fry. This ensures a pleasant change and amusing interactions. Personally, I thought the conversations between Dr. Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) and Ironman (Robert Downey Jr.) at times quite hilarious. Even the inner battle of Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) with his character Hulk caused me to chuckle. Only occasionally the coincidence is really laughable. But isn't this characteristic of such a superhero flick? For example, Hulk is catapulted from an Asgardian spaceship and flies several light years through the universe, after which he lands with an immense smack on earth. And where? Through the roof of Dr. Strange's house. What a coincidence.

When you think there's an oversupply of movies with superheroes in a latex suit and that the point of saturation had already been reached, then you can call this film an orgasmic highlight. And hats off to the makers for transforming this heterogeneous mixture of characters into a colorful whole. Certainly not a simple task. And even though I'm not a big supporter of sequels and I'm allergic to anything that smells like serials, I still look forward to the second part of this epic story. I wonder what one has to come up with in order to exceed this. That will be an impossible task. Even for superheroes.",7

Amazing Movie,18 September 2022,"This Movie Was Amazing Just No Words great action. It has a great story, great acting, and awesome looking was perfectly happy, so I can also give a comic book adaptation 10 out of 10 stars. Hats off to the writers, directors, producers, and Marvel Studios. Best Movie. Such a great storyline! The infinity stones, taking over the world, are so intriguing! All the characters are great. Infinity War did well in balancing the screen time among the characters in a way that every member of the Avengers get at least a moment to shine. There are also lots of great action, comedy, performances and a massive cliffhanger at the end that is well earned.",10

Did something no other marvel movie has ever done..... and they absolutely KILLED it!! BEST MARVEL MOVIE EVER MADE!!,27 April 2018,"I have waited for so many years for these amazing marvel characters to finally work together and kick some ass. Every single fight scene was pure perfection. I was just filled with so much happiness watching these superheroes fight together. You really can't ask for anything else. FINALLY marvel has made a villain on the big screen that is actually good. Thanos is one of my favorite villains after heath ledgers joker. You see exactly just how powerful he is and crazy he is. They also bring out his emotion side for a brief minute which is something I never saw coming. He is just amazing. And the comedy!! I would give the comedy a 10. You can tell that they aren't just jokes they added in at the last minute just to add it. Seeing Tom Holland being so happy just to be there was so good you can just tell how happy he is. He and tony stark are still like father and son, and they work so well together. All the characters get enough time in the movie so they don't just feel like they were put there just because they can and it'll make them money. I will worn you however, the ending will either make you hate it and infuriate you or you'll understand just why the Russo brothers did this. You might have to take a day to process what just happened but if you understand that the ending isn't a bad thing but kind of a work of art. I give a nine because of the ending and because there are those moments when they just feel a little long and you want to see thanos punch someone in the face but they really didn't bother me that much. So, in conclusion, this is my all time favorite marvel movie and I'm gonna see it like another 4 times at least while still in theaters. I'm still just amazed on how phenomenal this movie was and that we finally get the cross over we deserve and that it is definitely not a giant flop like justice league was. AWESOME movie.",9
The most amitious comic book movie but not the best ( by little ),30 April 2018,"When I saw Iron Man for the first time in theaters , I was a kid who just discover Comic books and I would never thought , 10 years later , a movie like Infinity War were going to happen . This movie is like a combination of Comic book fan dreams : The crossover and the multiples interactions between characters , The gigantic battles , the surprise and the vilain ( Josh Brolin is clearly MVP here ) but if you are a bit of a cinephile , you might be disturbed by the direction who are not very great if not terrible , or some lazy writing or some characters development . Even with these problems , Infinity war didn't disappoint and is by far one of the best MCU movies",8

Good but by no means great,13 May 2018,"Infinity War was hyped up to be an incredible spectacle, but although there were some incredible moments, especially with most one-liners being absolutely on point, some parts feel unnecessary; some drag on somewhat (Vision is a boring chap); and the whole film, especially the start, feels overtly Star Wars-y, which really confuses the viewing experience of a Marvel film, and leaves it overall as acceptably good, but not great.",6
Absolute Perfection,29 April 2018,"This movie an unapologetic perfection of a movie for Marvel fans. For those who have paid attention and appreciate the pure joy Marvel Studios has brought to cinemas for the past 10 years you will not be disappointed. There is twists, turns, unexpected moments, visually stunning action sequences and packed full of edge of your seat emotions. All characters get their moments to shine which in its self was incredible but the story that was told really knocked it out of the park. Can't wait for 2019.",10

Utter trash,20 March 2019,,1
Avengers: Infinity War (2018),28 April 2018,"I can't remember the last time I was so hyped for a film like this. Probably back in 2008 with the release of The Dark Knight. Well, ten years later here I was doing the same routine. Watching trailers over and over, avoiding all possible spoiler news about the film, and aching to watch it on opening day. Finally, the wait was over and I finally watched the film. While, I still don't think its my personal favorite Marvel film despite expecting it to be, the film is overall a very good film despite its different tone. Furthermore, there are no plot spoilers in this review, there may be thoughts but no real spoilers.

The film is the next installment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, which sees the Titan, Thanos, on a serious quest to find the Infinity Stones. The various stones let him control basic aspects of the world and make him powerful. The collection of all of them could change the universe drastically and make him the decider of anything that occurs Of course, The Avengers and surrounding heroes make it a mission to stop him and so we see our heroes unite (and split up) to attempt to take down this force that is unlike anything they've ever seen before.

There are a few negatives of the film but nothing that really bring down the quality of it so much. I think the Russo brothers did a generally good job of doing this ambitious crossover combining many characters from different films. However, some do not get enough screen time. Its nothing crazy, but it was expected. There are a lot of humor moments, most hit but not all. That might bother some of the viewers wanting less of that. Also, there are some major plot points that were dumb and questionable, not getting into it though.

I highly appreciated Josh Brolin as Thanos. One weakness of previous Marvel entries was a weak or generic villain. Finally we have one with a well fleshed out back story and one that is unpredictable. Thanos is legitimately threatening and you feel scared for the superheros when he is on screen. There are some moments that feel emotional and it ropes you in well. I feel like the tone and nature of this film is darker than anything in the MCU which I liked. Finally, things feel like they have consequences. The battles are for the most part fun and what you expect. The film is definitely incomplete because it was shot together with the next Avengers.

I have a lot more to say but feel worn out, in a good way. The real strength of Infinity War is being able to see characters you love interacting with one another. Ten years of films, were all leading to this and you can tell the filmmakers but a lot of effort and heart into it. It won't please everyone and does come with flaws and complaints but I think its an event that every comic book fan has to see in the theaters. I am ready for the hype for the next Avengers.

Infinity War renders you what you expect and much more!!,29 April 2018,"Infinity war is a long awaited and most anticipated movie(at least for every MCU fan). Fans have got a lot of excitement for the movie and Infinity War doesn't disappoint them at any point.

Our favorite superhero characters from MCU unite against Thanos , who is on a mission to collect all the six Infinity Stones in his Infinity Gauntlet. There are a lot of characters in the movie but the directors have managed to provide all an adequate amount of screen time. All characters make their presence felt and showcase their full power against Thanos, some of which you have never seen. Their are some ground breaking action scenes, heartbreaks , emotions, 'deaths' and amidst of this the movie is also successful in providing the audience a good amount of laugh.

I know that the fans don't need an review before rushing to the theaters but I assure you that you get in there grab your seat and popcorns and in the end the movie just leaves you wanting for more (like a part II). And don't miss the post credit scene.",10
I like the previous movie better,27 January 2022,I wonder why the ranking of 2018 is higher than 2015. The thing that i hate about this one is those strange creatures. What the hell the talking rabbit doing here !! Is it a cartoon for 5 years kids?!,7

Worth watching twice!,29 April 2018,"It was so good that i'm going to watch it again! The Avengers: Infinity War isn't just a gussied-up mediocrity being widely mistaken for a good movie. It's also, at least arguably, a dangerous movie for anyone who cares about the future of American cinema.",10

Although all heroes assemble, ehich is what all of us were eaiting for, the real star here is Thanos. The film gives us reasons to care abd understand him and what he has sacrificed. He is almost as fantastic as Heath Ledger's Joker which makes him the best and the star of this movie. If you haven't yet seen it I implore you to go and see it. This is the definitive Marvel masterpiece and deserves being praised for years to come.",10

Incredible!,27 June 2018,"I am so happy with this film. I don't ever write reviews for any movie, so this is my very first.

I have watched all of the Marvel films and most of them in theater. But I have never been more excited for a movie in my life! This wasn't just any movie. This was a damn event!! 10 years of Marvel. The character development they have for all of these films has been remarkable. Something I wish DC would do. It's so important to set a foundation with the characters so you can really care for them. I have seen this movie 3 times in theaters. I do not regret it. I needed to see it more than once at least, to get everything I possibly could out of it. It was so heartbreaking. The visual effects for the most part were spot on. And action was top notch and the acting was spectacular. Doctor Strange really stood out and proved to me that he's one hell of a Hero! Can't wait to see what's in store for Part two. Although I'm guessing there will be just as much or more heartbreak. Well done Marvel!",10
"You'll enjoy watching it, but it's not a good movie",29 April 2018,"This movie is incredibly entertaining. The comedy, the costumes, the CGI, the music... all of it is extremely well done.The acting is incredible, and it's great to see the characters we've loved for a decade all come together in an epic war for the future of the universe. That being said, this is a bad script disguised by great production. There are plot holes everywhere, the ending is unsatisfying, and there is no character development. Thanos is incredibly well done and the backstory is compelling; in contrast, the heroes Marvel has spent so many movies developing and making real and complete fall flat because they have no real development. There is no theme. It is true that the people who are saying there is no plot are wrong- there is a plot, there just isn't any emotional substance behind it. It is action without a compelling story for our heroes. Hopefully, all of this will be fixed and explained in the next installment, but for now, this movie is entertaining without anything more to it.",7
Almost Perfect,30 May 2018,"I really don't think there's much this film could've done better, except perhaps some better writing here and there, funnier jokes, and a bit of touching up on the CGI.

I went into this movie thinking it was essentially serve as a third act to the entire MCU and I was right but it was also more than that. At it's core this film is about Thanos, he's given a lot of screen-time to the point where he's basically the main character. The way most superhero movies work is we spend a majority of the film with the hero and then in mostly unconnected scenes until the third act, we sometimes cut to the villain doing their thing. Infinity War reversed that and treats Thanos like the protagonist but certainty not the hero. This created an extremely interesting film that I thoroughly enjoyed both times I saw it at the cinema.

The pacing was fantastic, the soundtrack was quite good, some of the cinematography was great, and some of the actors did some of their best work in this franchise yet, most notably Robert Downey Jr, Chris Hemsworth, and Tom Holland.",10

Infinity War: The Parent Guide (The best and only non-spoiler review you should read),30 April 2018,"Well well well, look who decided to watch another superhero movie?

It's here! Infinity War is finally here, after 10 years of MCU movies and over 20 years of fan boys waiting to see the mad titan on screen!

This review is for dad's all over the world trying to find out what their children have been bugging them about.

Let's get right to the point, go watch this movie. Want more detail? Here we go.

This movie starts off extremely well, building up that dark tone which lasts throughout the entire movie. There are three teams.

We have the New York team, which consists of Iron Man, Doctor Strange, and the Hulk.

We have the Wakanda team, which consists of Captain America (who now goes by the name Nomad), Black Widow, Falcon, Scarlet Witch, Vision, and of course, T'Challa himself, the Black Panther.

Lastly, we have the Space team, which consists of Thor and the Guardians of the Galaxy.

These three lines have their own individual story lines, yet they all slowly start connecting together. Feel that the plot is moving a bit fast with all the jump cuts? That's normal, after all, this is a marvel movie, not Dunkirk.

Let's tackle the simple question, shall we? Why is Infinity War so talked about? Well, here's your answer:

Remember all those random marvel movies that kept coming out? Only so you, the parent, could say ""Marvel has so many superheroes! All they need to do is to keep making movies of them and then they're set for life!"" Basically, that's what happened. Infinity War has all those characters in it. Hence ""the biggest crossover...""

Up until this point, some of the characters have been in their own world, minding their own business, such as the Guardians of the Galaxy. There was no connection to the Avengers or anything throughout the two movies, which is why it's fascinating to see them interact with all the characters who HAVE BEEN interacting with each other.

Haven't seen a marvel movie in a while? Are you absolutely clueless are what infinity stones are? Don't worry, this movie does an amazing job of putting together the little bits of knowledge everyone knows and expanding upon them.

Here's another reason why this movie is gaining popularity: people are going to die.

You heard it here first, well, that's a lie. Your child kept telling you that, so this is more like the 10th time?

Most of the characters you have been with for the last few years meet their ends, and it's up to you to find out.

Do I, the parent, need to watch this?: my father personally isn't in to superheroes very much. I, on the other hand, am. I own dozens of comics and know exactly how each character is the way they are. I drove my dad with me to the theaters each time a marvel movie came out, some he loved, some he didn't. Go watch this with your children, you'll have a blast!

Violence/Gore/Sexual Scenes?: some kissing (it's what people do). As said before, people do meet their end, some quick and easy, and others slow and painful. Nothing your child can't handle. Although they might get emotional when some, specific character dies, nothing too much to be worried about.

Conclusion: fill up your gas (even though it's reallly expensive), go down to the theater, and watch this movie. Not only will you enjoy it, your kids will enjoy it x10 more that they will bug you for the coming days, maybe even weeks. That's called parenting.

I'm 15, what do I know about parenting?",9

How the hell am I going to go to sleep?!? What magic that storytellers could have me so emotionally and intellectually invested in fictitious events.",10
"Not bad, but not great",7 May 2018,"The movie definately had some good action scenes and an interesting storyline. However Thanos' power seemed to fluctuate during the entire movie, which was often confusing. However I did sympathize with thanos and I thought he was a great villain with a clear objective. I was afraid that the overwhelming amount of characters would make the movie overly-chaotic, but i have to admit that it didn't bother me as much as I thought it would.

As I am a big marvel fan I did like this movie, however from an objective point of view the movie is often inconsistent and incomplete. You didn't really have time to relate to the characters, but the blame lies with the astonishing quantity of characters and it was to be expected.

I rate this movie 7/10, because it didn't live up to the expectations whatshowever. It does however leave you with a desire to see the sequel. Hopefully they'll nail this one.",7
Totally overhyped....,5 August 2018,,2
"ACTION PACKED, OUTSTANDING, MARVEL'S BEST TO DATE.",4 April 2019,"Brace for noble self sacrifice, senseless tragedy and straight up murder. The good news: really funny. It would be hard for any film to live up the level of sky high hype that has resulted and to satisfy us of every single one of these characters. This film deliver shock after shock. I dont know how to feel about the ending but the award for the most infinite cliffhanger of 2018 goes to this film. Overall well done!",9
Masterpiece of superhero movie.,4 June 2018,"I will start by saying this is the best marvel film to date, and arguably the best superhero film to date, on par with The Dark Knight. The villain Thanos is an absolute beast, and the best villain the MCU has ever seen, hell he is just one step lower than Joker.

Yes, it is exactly what you would expect from a superhero movie,over the top action scenes, stunning visuals and scenery with the added quality that MCU has been consistently giving us in the last few movies. Great humor, great acting, and some emotions here and there.

To all those who rated this movie less than 5/10, i feel sorry for you DC fanboys, but your 1/10 useless reviews are not convincing anybody but other DC fanboys.

Congratulations on 2billion MCU, you managed to outdo yourselves once again and set the bar to incredible heights. My only concern right now is that part2 will not be as good because this was incredible!",10
An epic and great story,1 December 2018,"Plot The end game arrives to the Avengers of Earth and the rest of the characters of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The powerful Thanos have finally arrived and starts to gather all the infinity stones with whom he could kill half of a world's population with a snap on his fingers. The Avengers and friends must finally face the titan and stop him from destroying all they love and have sworn to defend.

Verdict The long awaited Thanos storyline comes with much excitement, drama, action and comedy and gives us an all-out highly entertaining and great visually picture. The Russo brothers have done an extremely good job in connecting all the different characters and give them all enough space and make them all meaningful to the storyline. The MCU have been filled with blockbuster after blockbuster and the first infinity war is no exception. This is a great adventure & action story and I for one am already looking forward to the second part whom will reveals see how it all ends.

Avenoers: Infinity War,24 August 2020,"The more characters there are in a movie, the more one or two people need to be at the center of the narrative. The director chose Thanos, no problem, but no argument: his motivation is only a few words of reason?? How can the audience be emotionally invested in him when his choices and sacrifices are so inadequate? There are so many heroes that each one just shows up with a face to show that I'm there, just like a robot executing a program. Thanos is the villain in most of the scenes, but I don't think it is plump enough. Even the love between father and daughter is weak. The action is a bit less exciting, and marvel's massive Death is just a cheap way to keep the comic line in place and constantly disrupt the drama's mood as it goes along.",7
"With most of The Avengers and Guardians of the Galaxy ready to play, Avengers Infinity War is an exciting crossover event that'll satisfy most Marvel fans",28 April 2018,"We've spent ten years with Disney's Marvel Cinematic Universe. Whether you think it's a groundbreaking character driven story or a corporate cash cow, the MCU has managed to not only adapt the famous comics of Stan Lee and Jack Kirby (yes, I know there were a lot more people involved, so let's say all of those creative artists and writers of Marvel), but has managed to change how super heroes are seen on the big screen. They can have grey lines, they can be anti heroes, they can have moments where they don't even trust the government. I've personally love the MCU movies and will keep coming back to them to see where our heroes end up next.

Ever since The Avengers, the MCU has been teasing the upcoming villain Thanos. He had spent a good chunk of these movies on a throne, hoping that one of his minions can acquire certain stones, such as the power stone in Guardians of the Galaxy and the reality stone in Thor: The Dark World. Time has finally come for the Avengers and the Guardians of the Galaxy to team up in the major crossover event movie that is Avengers Infinity War.

What I won't do is list all the actors, but I'll give a brief look at the story without going into spoilers, as much of the film's enjoyment is what you don't know.

We open on Thor's ship where Thanos and his children has caught up with them and have acquired a couple of the stones. Thanos understands that if he can collect the rest of the stones for the gauntlet, he'll have the power to control the universe, time, and the fate of every living creature within his grasp. A last ditch effort sends Hulk/Bruce Banner back to Earth where he meets up with Dr. Strange, Iron Man/Tony Stark and Spider-Man/Peter Parker.

Meanwhile, Thor manages to get a distress call out where the Guardians of the Galaxy, Star-Lord, Gamora, Rocket Racoon, Drax, Groot, and Mantis, respond. Their fully aware of the danger that Thanos possesses and agree to help. Back on Earth, Vision and Scarlet Witch are attacked by Thanos' children, but saved by Captain America/Steve Rogers, Natasha Romanoff, and Falcon/Sam Wilson who all sense the danger. They make it to Wakanda to meet up with T'Challa/Black Panther. Together, all of these heroes end up in different areas as they try to stop Thanos from getting the rest of the Infinity Stones.

While Avengers Infinity War has a lot to live up to, I decided to not keep my expectations too high as I know that this is a tough movie to pull off. The good news is that I was very happy with what I got. You get your favorite superheroes and a lot of action that's warranted from the film's villain and his scary desire. I'll start off with. Josh Brolin finally gets to shine as one of the most complex villains of the MCU (which has not had a good track record of villains).

The heroes face a villain who is genuinely scary, thanks to several scenes of them fighting which I won't spoil and a lot of his view of the universe, which I also won't spoil. He is beyond powerful, smart, and does have a moral compass; just not a traditional one. We get more time with him and his relationship with Gamora and just what his children mean to him compared to the bigger picture. The other villains too, prove to be powerful, even if their not as memorable. It's made up with their overall impression of worship and how a lot of that driven emotion can generate into persuasion.

For a movie with a lot of characters, Avengers Infinity War has a lot of work juggling them. I'd say that one of the bigger flaws is that the editing around that is not done well. It'll spend a good twenty five minutes in space with dazzling effects, but then suddenly cut back to Earth in Africa. While we definitely see the consequences for the heroes, it doesn't give us enough at how the rest of the world would deal with such a threat. Why couldn't have more of the marvel heroes from ABC and Netflix also get involved? I can't blame them for this, but the movie might have benefitted from being longer, making the editing of the longer sequences feel justified.

I'll give this eight Infinity Gauntlets out of ten. I think most Marvel fans will be happy with the movie and the surprises it throws (yep, there are a lot of them here). If your not as well read and haven't seen the other movies, I'd recommend watching the other Avengers, Guardians of the Galaxy and Doctor Strange first. Again, I was happy with everything, given that I wasn't asking for too much. More might have been done to really make this an epic masterpiece like Ben Hur, but for a lot of people, this will be a Marvel to sight.",8

Excellent and Unsettling,27 April 2018,"It was a great movie, but if you hadn't seen most of the previous films, you might feel like you don't know anyone. There is so much action, it's almost an overload. I would have preferred a bit more character interaction. I understand the limitations the filmmakers were dealing with; but it was hard to feel invested in the characters; I brought my investment in from previous films. Ultimately it felt like most everyone was in a cameo role.

That being said, if I were not aware of movies yet to come, I'd need therapy after seeing this. I give mad respect to everyone for keeping the important things a secret. Only spoiler I am going to drop .... 4 will definitely be a continuation, otherwise this one makes no sense.

Final analysis, totally worth seeing.... but emotionally exhausting.",9
Best film ever,4 May 2018,,10
Highly recommended for action and suspense.,29 April 2018,"Infinity War was a great MCU film. A little anti-climactic, but had a huge cliffhanger. Going to preorder on Amazon, just because it was so good.",10
Yes please!,4 August 2018,"I was so super excited to see this and being a lover of marvel movies in general, I feel it held true for most of the marvel characters. Loved the continuation guardians of the galaxy and their own brand of sarcastic humor as my favorite of the marvel series so far. I was completely oh my WTF just happened when the movie ended in a cliffhanger but I feel for this story it's necessary to tell the whole story. The plot comes together with past movies and we begin to see the bigger picture that will follow, and we will be dying in anticipation for! So yes can't wait for more and totally disregard the one-two stars I've been seeing!",9
Cherry on top - part 1,1 May 2018,,10
Amazing movie,5 June 2018,"The movie was great. The CGI was beutiful, and the story was even better. Say what you want about the movie but Thanos was great. The Lavender Low-Life is one of the best, if not the best villian is the entire super hero movie genre to date. The only other one that comes close is Loki. The fight scenes are epic. I especially liked Thor and Dr. Strange in them. I guess it was mostly just the special effects, but they looked awesome fighting Thanos and his minions. There are also some cool non-fighting scenes, like the one from the trailer with Thor and the Guardians. I really like the relationship between Iron Man and Spider-Man. Tom Holland's performance was amazing. Overall, 10/10 would watch again.",10
Good,28 April 2018,Good movie with all around story. People in cinema who did not know this is part 1 got sad. If you are fan of genre do not miss just naje sure to use restriom first since this is almost 3 hours of sitting,7
Ruined my life,25 November 2018,-_- THIS MOVIE PUT ME THROUGH SO MUCH I REFUSE TO SEE IT AGAIN UNTIL A4 IS OUT.,10
Many people glorify too much,29 August 2018,,6
Overrated,22 August 2018,"Maybe if it wasn't so overrated I'd actually enjoy its CGI. Anyway, it's very monotonous and long, nothing really stands out and a twist in the end is so predictable. It pretends to be serious, but why would even bother? Jokes are so dull they make you cringe.",1
A groundbreaking spectacle in cinema.,12 December 2018,From the stylish cinematography to the stunning visual effects this movie has it all. Once again Robert Downey JR gives a confident performance as he leads the avengers into a breathtaking battle. The ensemble cast has the performance of there life time as the likes of Tom Holland and Benedict Cumberbatch amaze the audience. The avengers has officially revolutionised modern cinema as we know it.,10
An Unpected Yet Acceptable And Possible,29 April 2018,,10
"Just Saw Avengers, impressed but holding Judgement........",27 April 2018,"Okay people, i usually dont rate or comment on movies but i am going to... The Russo Brothers put together a really great movie, with a heart stopping ending.... Without giving to much away. This movie kept you on the edge of your seat the whole f.....ing movie cause you didnt know who was going to live or die from one minute to the next and there was some heart wretching killings.....But hopefully with that 4million to one odds that Doc saw they can pull it together to kill Thanos in the next one. Stay til the end of credits scene guys cause the beeper calls guess who?",8
Absolutely Phenomanal,27 April 2018,"This film blew me away with how good the acting and the special effects were well done Marvel, please don't listen to all these idiotic people that gave it terrible reviews they're wrong.",10
Very outstanding movie!!!!,3 April 2019,This movie was extremely incredible and outstanding all around!!!! The Russo brothers did a beautiful job shooting this film!,9
Quite unexpected...,22 July 2018,"Considering the fact that this is a SUPERHERO movie, it has the first ending that, actually makes a lot of sense. I don't understand what this movie was missing or what it had too much of to give it such bad ratings from the fans - some being HUGE marvel fans, yet hated the movie (Like one of my friends). All the ratings are 10s or 9s or 1s or 2s. C'mon, my marvel-fan friends, encourage the damn film so that Avengers 4 will be the best amongst all the films! Let's make the next movie worth an 11!!!",10
"The battles is complicated, about the mighty villain (with the stones)",15 September 2020,"Thanos is the most powerful, he always defeats all the heroes, (but they always like his action) and we only see (thanos is in wakanda and killing Vision). It will be that the stones are entangled in various scenarios; that they are not well, by the power of thanos (when it was the snap), and that the heroes solve the revenge.",6
smoke,28 August 2018,"It's great movie Anderby the, the only thing that I have a good idea, I have a",10
Reluctantly Enjoyed It,22 August 2018,Marvel has become stale and repetitive. The plots to a lot of these movies seems to always repeat it self only under different characters and the CGI stuff is just fake as ****. Unfortunately I liked this one and I don't even know why. Maybe I'm on crack. I don't know. Anyways I really don't want to say anything more because I hate myself for even saying I like this garbage.,7
Not a very good movie,22 August 2018,"The main reason i'm giving this movie 1/10 is because this one doesn't deserve the current rating that it has(at the moment of writing this is 8.6, I would refer to other current movie ratings at the moment of writing this review). A rating of 8.6 means that this movie is as good as The matrix(8.7), Saving private Ryan(8.6), Memento(8.5), Interstellar(8.6) and also that it is better than Mr. Nobody(7.9) and Synecdoche, New York(7.5), etc.

This is the result of a movie with lots of fans who don't have any idea how to rate a movie and usually haven't seen much. at the most I would give this movie a 5.3, it is not so bad and it's enjoyable not memorable. Too many jokes and this is not a comedy, it doesn't seem to have a script not giving a chance for the actors to actually act.

In the movie they combine cinematography of some of the other movies related to this franchise, so in some instances the quality drops really low to the point you feel as if you're watching a really bad TV series, most CG effects are on point and sometimes not(the hulk buster).

I personally don't understand who would give a score of 10/10 or 9/10 so easily to a movie no one will remember next year.",1
It doesn't get much better than this!,28 April 2018,"I don't want to go too much into detail with my review of this film, only that it is incredible and that you need to go and see this film before some inconsiderate A-hole spoils it for you!

This film was everything I wanted and more, all I can say is, bring on avengers 4!!!",10
The best flim ave seeen in a long time an I watch a lot ..,4 May 2018,This has just become my favourite flim ...watched it at the cinema so glad a went to see it ..this will not disappoint at all ..10/10 must see,10
Best Marvel Movie,1 December 2018,Best Marvel Movie! Best Marvel Movie! Best Marvel Movie! Best Marvel Movie! Best Marvel Movie! Best Marvel Movie!,10
Stan Lee Rocks!,9 June 2018,,10
This is where all roads led!!,3 May 2018,"Although I was checking the score on a few sites, I have not yet read any reviews or comments on Avengers: IW, so this opinion is based solely on my experience earlier today. This movie is up there with the best fantasy epics of my adolescence, or with some of the greatest comic book/superhero movies of more recent years. It's huge. It's epic. It's amazing. It's a damn well orchestrated symphony. It's Beethoven's 9th. For me, it doesn't get any better. But...unfortunately, not everyone will think that, or have the same experience. Why? Because it can't be considered a standalone movie and it can't be enjoyed as one. It is the top of the pyramid but you can't just land on it, you have to climb the whole pyramid first. It's a cinematic orgasm, but you have to go through the sex to get to it. It requires previous MCU knowledge, without it is just like watching the Superbowl with no understanding of the game. Many scenes, dialogues, lines, actions and choices of certain characters...won't work without it and will have less to no emotional impact on the viewer. So yes, for Marvel vets is the (first half of a) Champions League Final of all Marvel movies, for others is just an explosive game with perhaps to many players on the field. In Spidey's words: Sorry, I can't remember all your names..."" Well I can, and I will never forget any of them...",9
Infinity War is absolutely amazing!,26 August 2018,10 years and 18 movies. It has all been leading up to this and itdoes more than live up to the hype! this movie made me feel so many emotions and I have to say that Thanos is one of the best villians of all time.,10
Dark. Light. Amazing.,28 April 2018,,7
Best movie of all time,4 September 2022,"For me.. this is the best movie ever made.

Great actors, great music, story and probably the best villain of any movie of all time. It also have allot of funn moments wich allot of movies fail with to bring in.

Its starts with a 100/100 and finishes with a 200/100 Its a long movie but it felt like a 15min movie when i watched it. Not a single boring moment.

Anyone that says this movie is bad need to start rethink about their lives and that maybe they are a mistake to this world.

Marvel shouldve stopped doing more movies and series after after endgame aswell. Cause all after that is just milking money and not good enough.",10
Infinity war (2018),7 May 2018,"Good, entertaining, creative summer popcorn flick. Nothing special or groundbreaking though.",7
Enjoyment of movie depends of if you are a fanboy(girl) or not.,11 May 2018,"The rating of 10 are obviously people under the age of 18 or extreme fans of Marvel. This is not even the best Marvel movie this year(Black Panther had better story & drama), definitely nowhere near 'best superhero movie ever'. The action and special effects are very well done, the pacing, powers and 'decisions' are on par with a B-horror movie. When having the ability to end a scene quickly or leave a scene quickly, our 'heroes' would stand there and trade one-liners. I seriously considered walking out at the lack of competence. For the record, I loved Avengers, loved Winter Soldier so it is not like I cannot enjoy a superhero flick. This one is not(unless you are a fanboy(girl).",5
Great movie,29 April 2018,"Pretty much what you'd expect with a Marvel film, but more",10
Very Unique: Definitely one of the Best Films of the MCU,28 January 2023,,8
Wow!,12 June 2018,"Where should I start? Geez what a spectacular movie considering that the amount of characters are in it.how did the russos do it? Fun, exciting,emotional and just fun!",10
I couldnt think of anything else,30 April 2018,"I was so excited before watch the movie. After watched the movie, I was freezed, couldn't think of anything else. The best movie I ever watched. I laughed, cried and so much involved. I have never enjoyed any movie like this much. It us must watch film but please at least understand what is going on in previous film before you go to movie, you will definitely love this movie. Please dont miss this awesome experience",10
Magnificent,28 April 2018,Well i diddn't expect something different .a Brilliant movie with Awesome Villain and Great humor .it totally lives up to The hype,10
"Marvel's Payoff: A Flashy, Risk-Taking, Galaxy-Crawling, All-Hands-On-Deck Melee",18 September 2018,"A decade's worth of intertwined superhero adventures culminates in one staggering, towering behemoth of a film. It sounds like a tall order - and, clearly, it is - but Marvel's been doing this for quite a while now and seem to have a firm grasp of the essentials. Effectively juggling so many competing stars, flavors, themes and aesthetics was my largest concern, especially ones as disparate as Captain America and the Guardians of the Galaxy, but obviously this was a core focus for Infinity War's producers. Not only does each scene retain the characteristic tone and identity of its unique featured franchise, it also mixes fluidly with those of another, creating a fresh blend that works almost effortlessly and moves in exciting new directions. This is the essence of the Marvel universe, particularly so from a long-term reader's perspective, and it's something I've yet to grow tired of seeing on the big screen. Creating a great cast is step one, but watching them grow and interact with the unfamiliar is where the real magic happens. Each subsequent installment in the Avengers franchise ups that ante just a little bit further.

No doubt, I would've been content to just watch these familiar faces bounce around in the same enclosed space, trading zingers and butting heads, but there's an underlying reason for all this, and the film (somehow) doesn't shortchange that, either. Thanos, the big wrinkle-chinned monster who's been hinted at and referenced for years, has finally come to town with a destructive cause in mind. Well-rounded villains have not been a strength for the MCU thus far, but in this case they make amends. Thanos is quickly and efficiently established as a galactic-level threat, far and away the most powerful creature we've seen so far, and then thoroughly fleshed out as a fully-realized three dimensional character. We may not agree with his means, but his motivation is certainly understandable. That's a new thing, a clearly addressed criticism, and it makes the film far stronger.

So, yes, I enjoyed myself. The new Avengers is a big deal, it takes big risks, and judging from the box office numbers, it's reaped big rewards. There are also several little flaws for those interested in picking. Most glaringly, it falls into the trap of being merely half a movie. After the better part of three hours, I left the theater with the feeling I'd just binge-watched an entire season of an expensive TV series and been left hanging with a ""tune in next time."" Its story is obviously incomplete, and while that's played for maximum effect in the stunning conclusion (the first time I've ever seen an entire theater sit through a credit roll in complete silence), that stuck in my craw. My other complaints can be largely brushed away as inconsequential - inexplicably missing characters, too many guest spots, a not-insignificant barrier of entry - but that's a relatively big one and something that I keep revisiting. Having cleared my chest of that, though, I'll strongly recommend it as a fundamental bit of summer blockbuster history, even if it isn't quite summer yet. Potential viewers should already know what to expect (Infinity War is just another refinement in the well-worn Marvel formula) and whether or not that's remotely up their alley. If so, by all means, go see it more than once. This is the best entry yet. And maybe, just maybe, it'll shine even more brightly as a Lord of the Rings style all-day anthology. Once the story is actually complete, that is.",8
Alonstanding movie is bad,27 August 2018,This movie is bad as a alonestanding movie but i think in the series it is ok,6
Fantastic Film,13 May 2018,Great film. On a par with Avengers Assemble for me. Great balance of action and humour. Can't wait for Avengers 4,9
What a blockbuster should be... a ball-busting experience!,2 May 2018,"I've been watching so many ""artistic"" movies lately, and although those are great in their own way- in my opinion what a movie should really be about is escapism while conveying a message. The message in Infinity War is clear: everyone is united and fighting against some united cause. There is hope in humanity after all despite all the chaos.

The critics have been slamming this movie due to it being too ""chaotic"" and completely missing the importance of having chaos in this movie. It's almost like an invisible side-character

The humour is one of the wittiest and funniest i've seen in a Marvel movie so far and it's clear that they put a lot of effort and time into this movie.

Why are the critics so hard on a movie that simply wants to entertain before patronizing?

I've watched many ""critically acclaimed"" movies lately and they have just made me feel depressed, drained out of hope, and the message was contrived yet concealed in some wishy-washy, snobby, elitist and morally assumptive package.

Infinity War isn't about that. It's about how YOU perceive hope in times of danger, while not being afraid to go into the unknown. To fight the most evil man out there. Marvel did a great way of portraying teamwork and desperation instead of how this movie could have otherwise gone: extremely cheesy.

Infinity War is the most entertaining movie i've watched this year and one of the few movies where I sat in the theatre for over 2 hours what felt like and flash-forwarded to the end because of how EPIC and FUN this movie was.

The critics have been watching so many preachy and superficial movies with amazing ""plot twists"" and ""stories that break the heart"" when in reality they are more superficial and gimmicky than anything Infinity War ever intended to do.

Infinity War is about having a good time. Critically acclaimed movies these days seems to just be about spreading a message covered in a $$$ and ego-boosted package.",7

Avengers: Infinity War review,26 August 2020,,8
Amazing movie!,5 June 2018,"Ignore the people giving this low scores, this is an amazing movie and clearly they are bitter and trying to bring down the ratings or something. The way they bring together so many characters in one movie is amazingly well done & it works. There are almost no boring parts in the movie. What surprised me most is that although I hated things Thanos did he's not simply pure evil, he's doing it out of a sense of achieving a greater good. His regret during certain actions makes me feel differently about him then other typical bad guys. I've seen it 4 times and it's enjoyable each time, I definitely look forward to owning it! Now one of my all time favourite movies. I typically don't believe in a perfect movie but this one comes as close as I've ever seen.",10
"""This one goes to 11!""",27 April 2018,,10
Good but a bit of a cheat,5 May 2018,,8
If every Marvel movie had been like Infinity War...,30 April 2018,I'd be a diehard Marvel fan. I've seen every one of these movies... sometimes I went to the theater... sometimes I just waited till it was made available and I could watch whenever for free. No matter where or how I saw them I almost always walked saying the same thing... Eh. When Iron Man came out I was still a teenager and I really enjoyed it... but after that it was honestly the most mature of the films until Infinity War or should I say Marvel's Dark Knight LOL! Still had all the Marvel humor but was much darker or really deeper than anything Ive seen from this studio. I bet DC has to be feeling pretty embarrassed about Marvel's CG villain!! Holy crap. Seriously DC... and i'm a fan but go back to the drawing board bc Thanos just literally shamed everything you've done since Dark Knight Trilogy. Obviously I won't spoil anything but I definitely had tears in my eyes at the end... not because I love everything Marvel but bc I was truly that moved. This was a hard earned 10/10... all credit due to the directors Joe and Anthony Russo! The years of hard work I'm sure went into this REALLY SHOWED. Inspiring.,10
"Oh yeah, but for some, think!",8 November 2018,"Honestly, this is just so fun to watch! Exciting, And truly a great way to tie it all up from all previous marvel movies! There people that are like, ""it's dumb how this relies on the other movies"" or how you have to know the other movies to whatch this. That gets me mad for this whole Marvel Cenamatic Universe is not just separate movies but a whole series just like Harry Potter or other book series and movie serious. Just as if you were to read the last book in a series, it won't make sense, where this is will be the same thing, it won't make sense, they've been building up to this movie and the next for over 10 years! So for people to say that you need to rely on the other movies to understand or jokes that refer to other movies, then you have no right to say this is a good or bad movie, because you don't know anything about the series!

In the end, they did a Fantasic job making the infinity war and is a truly great movie that brings the comic book characters to life in a all out fight against Thanos and his army! But it ain't over yet. Not to mention that they made Thanos really well in strength and look and not phoney, cannot wait for the next one witch I totally believe will be amazing in every way as our comic superhero's continue to fight for the universe.",10
The best marvel film,20 June 2019,This is easily the best marvel movie to date. Thanos as a villain is menacing but still sympathetic which is one of the films greatest strengths,6
"Busy, busy, busy",30 April 2018,,10
Not bad Marvel not bad,7 August 2018,"I am a huge fan of the comic series this is adapted from and was hoping it would be epic, like the comic book. It wasn't terrible (but alas not close to the awesomeness of the comic). Lately Marvel movies have been rather meh, this one was much better, maybe because it didn't focus on any on character for very long, had enough humor and action to keep the pace going.

I am coming to the realization that these movies are really geared towards kids, and made entertaining enough so the parents won't be put off by watching. When I think about it like that 12 year old me would have been giving this a 10 and I would have wanted more more more.

Out of the recent Marvel movies I have seen, Black Panther and Spider man, this one is the best, followed by Spiderman and Black Panther.

Looking forward to the next chapter.",7

We're British...we don't clap at the end of movies...,26 April 2018,"Except for Avengers: Infinity War.

Man, this is difficult to do without spoilers...so I will describe my movie going experience instead.

The best and funniest moments that had the theatre laughing out loud were, of course, the interactions between Thor and the Guardians of the Galaxy.

There was a woman sitting behind me who started crying towards the end of the movie while there were more restrained but audible gasps of shock from the rest of us.

The last 10 minutes of the movie had the entire theatre silent, as in a pin could've dropped and you would've heard it.

None of us left before the end credits scene which is when we were all excitedly discussing what we had just watched.

After the end credits scene, the theatre, where we as proud Brits are usually loathe to show any emotion in typical British stiff upper lip style, erupted in clapping.

The attention to detail and the pace held my attention from start to finish and I am so excited for the next installment. Yes, there were a few things I didn't like about the movie but detailing them would place us in spoiler territory and this movie needs to be seen spoiler free. So, if you've not seen it yet, please avoid the internet until you do.",10

Speechless,27 April 2018,"It's been a day and I can say this movie was cinematic perfection. Seeing so many characters on screen, and how incredibly well this film was edited, it's honestly very impressive. Alan Silvestri delivered an amazing score that no other composer could have done, with a film this big. I say this as a huge Brian Tyler and Hans Zimmer fan. The Russo's have made a film that will be tough to top. I wish the film was three hours. Maybe Avengers 4 can satisfy my want. 10/10 for me based on what I said above. Can't wait to watch it a second time.",9

Too busy for its own good.,29 April 2019,"It is an Avenger superhero movie and it develops as it is to be expected. It's chaotic, relentless in its progression and there's just so much happening that's quite hard to take seriously half of it. Every scene has a new character, a new development, something unreasonable happening. There's just too much to be done for a single movie and as a consequence most of it is mediocre in its execution. On the other hand, it's entertaining in its action and combat scenes. Effects are great and the soundtrack fitting. The saving grace is the ending, maybe the only unexpected bit of the entire movie.",7

Too many heroes and villains but not enough time,5 November 2018,Review: I felt out of place because I didn't see the four or five marvel movies that helped put together this movie. The direction and screenplay are really good. Both the casting and acting are really good also. All in all I would give this three out of a possible five stars.,7
"Do not believe the planted 10/10's, this is a disappointing movie overall.",28 April 2018,"I was really excited to watch this third Avengers movie, being that they were going all in with both the Avengers and the Guardian characters but ultimately the movie is just one big mess of a movie. The movie is more of a Thanos story which is fine as we need to know as much about this Titan, however the rest just didn't measure up.

I understand getting some 30 characters together in one movie was always going to be a stretch, but I really didn't enjoy the movie. I won't delve into the plot as many reviewers have done so, I will just say that some of the action sequences were pretty good especially from Iron Man and Dr Strange, but ultimately the ending really agitated me and yes, we all know there will be another movie soon to complete this story but it just felt like a setup movie.

Not as epic as everyone is making it out to be. I still rather watch the first Avengers, the Winter Soldier and even Ragnarok over this any day.",4
Everything leads up to this,12 March 2019,The Russo brothers pulled off one of the biggest movies of all time. Running around 2 1/2 hours it's a movie that only feels like an hour long with countless characters it lets all of them have a moment to shine...I came into this movie expecting so much and I still came out with exceeding expectations. A job well done to the Russo Brothers and I can't wait to see Avenegers Endgame...they believe it'll top this...but I don't know how they could,10
Avengers: Infinity War is... Better Than the Usual Marvel Fare.,28 June 2018,"Before I begin, I must warn you that I am not a Marvel fan, so my opinion may be a bit ""mediocre,"" while an avid fan would be thrilled with this film.

Firstly, I must say that the movie does deliver when it comes to excitement and well choreographed action; unlike the recent 'Spider-Man: Homecoming' and 'Thor: Ragnarok,' where the fighting went on and on and seemed boring and sloppy.

The humor is also slightly better than other Marvel films where comedy is ""attempted."" Also, the gags and one-liners were timed well and did not interfere with drama scenes, as they have before, taking the seriousness out if it.

And of course, the most anticipated element of the film was the rumored ""shocking"" finale. The end of the movie was indeed a surprise, which makes it exciting to look forward to the next installment. There are some superheroes that were either underused or did not appear at all, but I imagine that Marvel will work them in next time.

Most of the actors gave strong and not-too-hammy performances, and the plot actually made some sort of sense (aka they tried to explain it).

The only downsides were the completely unrealistic stunts (but of course we expect and enjoy those in a superhero movie), a few slightly cheesy lines, and a very brief moment of painfully bad CGI. And, I'm sorry, but I'm kinda tired of Stan Lee's inevitable cameos. It was funny the first 20 times, but now it's getting a little old. But that's just me.

So all in all, I was impressed with 'Avengers: Infinity War,' I will definitely see Part II, and that's really something coming from me!",8
"Everything I hoped for, and something's I didn't",28 April 2018,"I left the theater like "" no! No! It can't be!!"" No spoilers here, but oh my goodness what a film!

"Better than Endgame in my opinion, behind the first Avengers and Spider-Man 2, best superhero movie of all time!",21 August 2021,"While this is a movie that revolves around the villain and leaves audiences stunned in an uneasy way, it was executed flawlessly. I loved all of the characters together and their moments, especially how Thor, Doctor Strange, and even Quill were portrayed in the movie given their character roles.

"Amazing and breathtaking, the Avengers: Infinity War is the real deal!",26 April 2018,"I've just seen the greatest comic book movie ever made!!!! I'm not overhyping this film but that was breathtaking, beautiful, dramatic, deep, poetic, funny, emotional and action packed in ways I can't even describe. Believe the hype, the s**t just got real. Avengers: Infinity War stands head and shoulders above anything that's gone before it and yes, that includes DC. Perfection!!",10

"Epic, Emotional, and Satisfying",28 April 2018,"By the time the credits rolled, I was in tears. This film successfully brings together all of the heroes we've grown to love in the 10 years since the first Iron Man in a way that is epic, emotional, and satisfying...and all of this without it ever feeling too crowded. The tone is spot-on, with funny moments, serious moments, and emotional ones. Watch this movie as soon as you can - it is spectacular.",9
"This is not a movie, this is an event",28 April 2018,"On a purely subjective level, I loved this movie. Ever fiber in my nerdy body fell in love with this movie. I wont get into much more but I had a blast watching this unfold. As I said however, this is not a movie, this is an event. Do not walk into this movie expecting rich character moments or complex themes. You really have to have seen the prior films to understand who everyone is and what they're all about. It's 3 hours of people punching things. I have a few other complaints but then I'd be getting into spoiler territory.",7
To Infinity and beyond!,13 June 2018,"Avengers: Infinity War is a very well-made film. Every piece is combined brilliantly to create a stunning spectacle. Throughout the film I was glued to the screen and frozen in my seat. There are so many shocking, intense and even humorous moments. It is truly amazing to see 10 years of hard work all combine to achieve a tremendous result.

A film of this size and grandeur always had a huge task in terms of assembly, but the editing and pacing of the film is highly commendable. The film had so much to live up to and as a devoted Marvel fan I can tell you that it does not disappoint. A big reason behind the film's success is down to the Russo brothers who have now cemented their careers as cinema legends. The special effects in Infinity War are some of the best I have ever seen: the character Thanos looks positively menacing! To describe the film as a visual spectacle is an understatement. It is clear that a lot of hard work went into every frame of the film and it really pays off.

There are so many larger than life characters in the film and seeing all of them united is a dream come true. I must admit I was sceptical when I first heard that all the characters were appearing together, but after viewing the finished product I can only salute the makers of the film. The acting in the film is compelling and I really liked the storylines of all the heroes. However, I was not expecting to appreciate the storyline of Thanos as must as I did. Thanos is an awesome villain and I think that this is down to the filmmakers taking the time to carefully craft an interesting history and aura to the character which is brought to life by Josh Brolin who does a fantastic job.

Overall, I would highly recommend Avengers: Infinity War. It is a great instalment to the Marvel franchise and I am excited to see how the film series concludes.",8
Iron Man should have been in it more. Captain America should have done more. Thanos is like the main star. And the Avengers suck making plans. I'm a DC fan now.,16 August 2018,,7
Braindead trash,27 August 2018,"Scene after scene just explosions and hollow dialogues that were meant to be funny but they´re not. This montage of CGI with idiotic dialogues serves only for bucks, it´s not made for cinephiles not even for comic collectors like me.

Infinity War is Amazing,27 April 2018,"Avengers Infinity War is the long awaited superhero movie that all marvel fans have been waiting for. If you have kept up with the other 17 or 18 films to date, this movie does not disappoint. Even for those who barely keep up with marvel movies will enjoy this movie do to its great storyline and rollercoaster of emotions.",10
A great time to be alive in,29 April 2018,"The Infinity War has 10 years of back story leading to this, and even with the dozens of stars and characters, it managed to shine each and every character and everyone had their own time and role in the movie. It was a very ambitious project but I have to say, it did very well.

Thanos was just amazing. An antagonist instead of a simplistic evil villain, you simply cant hate him without feeling for him.",10
Great Popcorn Fun,30 December 2022,"Do you remember crossover episodes on TV shows? You got a mix of both shows that were crossing over but never quite the magic and strength that those shows had when they were independent of each other. That's kind of how I feel about ""Avengers"" movies. It's great to see all of the heroes team up and kick butt, but at the same time you never quite get some of the great character moments that you do in their solo films as they all struggle and fight for screen time. The fights with Thanos (Josh Brolin) are awesome, love the cliffhanger. Some of the CGI honestly doesn't look too great though. Something about the fact that Marvel Studios has to pump out three or four of these a year.

I don't know, it was a big cultural milestone when it came out, but looking back in hindsight it really seems like one of those ""you just kind of had to be there"" type of movies to really grasp what it meant to people a few years ago. Without the context of the preceding twenty or so films, a lot of it gets lost on its own as a standalone movie. And unless you already watched those movies, this one really is nothing more than a big waste of time.",8
Awesome Movie,29 January 2023,,9
one of the best eras ever (including endgame),22 November 2022,"I remember feeling so impatient, i saw the release date for endgame and was wondering whether itd still be hyped until then. It was. It sure was.

After so many films from this franchise, all your characters I've grown up with, grown to be attached as well, all just meeting each other in one movie. It felt like a puzzle set slowly solving itself.

The pacing was beautiful, the cgi was amazing as well. It was entertaining and alot of roller coasters of moods. The jokes were funny and iconic. On the subject alot of iconic and epic scenes. It was amazing.

I wish I could tell people and recommend this to then but it really wouldnt be as cool if they never or barely watched the franchise.",10

Fantasy rather than a superhero movie,12 January 2019,"Superheros are super because they do amazing things compared to the rest of us in this world. Here however, everyone does amazing things, always, for too long. It becomes boring. There is no normal world in the background to provide the contrast, it is one (long) fantasy tale. They're all ""super"" so no one is super anymore. And I feel some character have lost their true nature. Iron Man for example: what defines the character is his suit of armour, high tech sure, but still ""clunky"" and ""solid"". This new nano tech suit fits and looks like a soft glove: transition from a knight in armour to a well dressed, tailored character. Of course the movie is visually striking, but again, from the first scene to the last: I got used to the visuals after about 20 minutes, the rest felt to me like repetition.",3

"Dread it. Run from it. Destiny arrives all the same. And now it's here. Or should I say, I am.",26 October 2022,"This is the most intense, complex, and stirring Marvel Cinematic Universe film yet -- though the sheer number of characters and storylines make it a bit confusing for anyone who's not a hard-core fan. Avengers: Infinity War is also the grimmest MCU movie so far, with consequences unlike any that have come before in this massive franchise. Much of the talk about the film will centre on those events (no more details here, to avoid spoilers), but there's more to it than that. Directors Joe and Anthony Russo and screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely were already responsible for two of the best MCU entries to date, Captain America: The Winter Soldier and Captain America: Civil War. With Avengers: Infinity War, they continue to respect viewers' intelligence while giving their characters deep motivations and presenting knockout action scenes. It's as lean as epics get; none of its nearly two-and-a-half-hour running time feels wasted. While the many characters and intersecting plots may confuse casual viewers -- the filmmakers assume audiences are familiar with all that's come before -- for fans, it's one mind-blowing moment after another, starting with a jaw-dropping fight in the first minutes. Plus, Infinity War is also one of the funniest MCU movies yet, relying on character-based humour rather than some of the wacky flights of fancy of, say, the also excellent Thor: Ragnarok.

The performances benefit from the strong script, no-nonsense direction, and the growth the actors have experienced in their roles over many years. It's fun to watch two of the MCU's biggest egomaniacs, Downey Jr.'s Tony Stark and Cumberbatch's Stephen Strange, bump up against each other -- and then for Pratt's off-kilter Star-Lord to crash into the mix. Relationships are deepened, and it's a huge relief to see the Avengers working together again after the events of Civil War. Thanos, as voiced by Brolin and brilliantly animated by the VFX team, is perhaps the most frightening villain ever in a comic book film, largely because he's so thoroughly convinced that he's actually a good guy who's willing to make hard choices and impossible sacrifices in the universe's best interests. Without spoiling anything, the film's dire consequences feel almost Game of Thrones-like, with well-known characters defeated as never before. Some kids will likely be upset by that. But keep in mind that this is a comic book world (so things aren't always what they seem), and -- in the meantime -- appreciate the fact that the overall effect gives Infinity War the highest stakes and biggest wow factor of the MCU so far.",8

"Another Amazing Blast of the 3rd Phase, Marvel did it again!",25 August 2018,"Infinity War was a spectacle of a film, I really don't know what to say as a big Marvel/DC fanboy, The film does kind of open a little clunky so I thought that was a little flaw. But to all this wait, it was worth it. The action sequences were non stop and the film didn't let me breathe from start to finish which I felt exhilarated as of seeing everyone reunite together for 10 years and that's what this film gave me. It does a solid job on it's performances with a big cast and it's so amazing to see them on screen again. The humor was hilarious and I love the way Marvel makes their jokes so memorable and it did deliver that. Thanos was a masterpiece as the villain or is he a villian? His CGI was great but by the last act it's quite noticeable, Either way, he was so great in this film, his motivation is so great it felt intimidating every time he appeared on screen and is a touching character at times and I love the way the Russo Bros really gave him a backstory that expresses the character more. The Black Order was ehhhhh idk but Ebony Maw was the one I felt more a character in him and was cool. CGI was overused alot with a big budget and it was great. The ending was a bit contreversal and shocking and will leave audiences heartbroken in which I thought was a very well executed scene that you feel tension once it happens. Overall, Avengers infinity War was a masterpiece of a film, if you go into this film with an empty brain with no idea about how it leads to this then this is not a film you'll be surprised if don't watch the previous MCU movies, the action sequences were so enjoyable, the humor was hilarious I only thought a very few didn't land and is a pretty unexpected and emotional film that hits you hard and I am totally speechless about this film 10/10",10

"Rarely have I seen a movie where so much is going on, but nothing is happening.",2 August 2018,"Rarely have I seen a movie where so much is going on, but nothing is happening. Besides the typically impenetrable CGI action, you are expected to follow five plot threads at once- often waiting fifteen minutes to return to them. Heaven help you if you've missed any of the previous Marvel installments going in.

You have a well-acted villain in Thanos whose motivation makes no sense. He is a galactic scale eco-terrorist who strives to cull half of the universe at random, owing to his fears of resource depletion from overpopulation. To believe the universe is in danger of overpopulation is asinine, not least because Thanos learns how to ALTER REALITY. Why slaughter so many people with a snap of your fingers, when you could make the universe more abundant instead?

There's little on offer by way of genuine drama (hindered by the nagging sense that death is not permanent in a comic series transplanted to the screen). It's packed to the gills with immersion-breaking humour (because a superhero movie can't take itself seriously without being called ""grimdark"", apparently). The Hulk, for example, is reduced to one big joke about erectile dysfunction.

Avengers: Infinity War is a lumbering behemoth, like a suitcase stuffed to the point its zip is breaking. The obvious conclusion to building a universe that must connect, yet be constrained to a sub three hour running time. The stakes are raised so high that ""trillions of lives"" are threatened, but the basics of film making (character development, plot, motivations, theme, pacing) are almost entirely overlooked. The movie carries no dramatic weight, and feels more like a who's who of Marvel characters. It is a Saturday morning cartoon very much brought to life, with all the associated one-dimensionality.",3
Great,19 May 2018,"What can I say? Not the best Marvel movie and not the worst, not by a long shot. One thing for sure, this is a heck of a ride. Awesome action, awesome payoffs. I had to watch it twice. The second time I watched it, I wish I had a remote control for the Vision and Scarlet Witch moments - as well as anything to do with the green skin chick who makes you yawn whenever she opens her mouth.

"Avengers Infinity War, the superhero movie we were waiting for",30 April 2018,"Marvel Studios reaches ten years, in wich we experience great films and also some not good enough.

I'm befuddled,18 June 2018,"I loved this movie! Having seen ALL of the Marvel movies leading up to this, I found it exciting, funny in all the right moments and also sad. It kept me entertained the whole time and when it was over I wanted more..that's the definition of a good movie. Those who said they were lost or didn't understand or it didn't have a good plot line...wtf? Are you sure you were watching Infinity Wars? Go back and watch the other Avengers, along with the Guardians of the Galaxy, Thor..etc..if you need to understand more of the story line",10
The result of a long term project,3 May 2018,"That's what Infinity War is... since the first Iron Man 10 years have passed, and Marvel Studios built, piece by piece, this ambitious superhero TV series for the cinema is something few people would have thought could work.

We can now say the project was successful, even though there's a price to be paid: no talented directors to bring their vision to the characters (Whedon left, Wright was not even able to complete his Ant Man and so on) in name of the long term project, the budget per project was someway limited (this kind of movies usually has a much bigger budget) and, finally, you have movies like this one that don't stand on their own since the assumption is you watched the previous movies and know the characters.

Anyway, Infinity War is the first part of the climax of the project, and it delivers more that 2 hours and a half of entertainment. Humor is well balanced as well as the on screen time of all characters. You'll not be bored. It's focused on the villain, finally a menacing (and interesting) one (even though his solution to what he feels is a lack of balance in the Universe is way too much simplistic). You'll see a big and emotional ending, even though us comic book readers know very well that superheroes can overcome even the most dire of the situations. We just have to wait the next Avengers movie.

Sure, the directing is TV-like, the special effects are limited by the budget, the OST is not exactly exciting even though better than most of the previous movies, we seem to have lost some details from what we watched before (example, in Ragnarok Thor finally is God of Thunder, his power not linked to the hammer that is merely something to better channel it, here it seems he's back to being the God of the Hammer... but he's as powerful as he should be).

I'd say there are more pros than cons, and you should absolutely not miss this one if you watched the Marvel Studios movies so far but, if you didn't, don't bother watching this one.",8

"If you fan of the superhero action fantasy movies, you also like this film. Otherside, just an average marvel films, with the best marvel villain.",1 May 2018,"If you fan of the superhero action fantasy movies, you also like this film.

Well, I never been comic action hero fan, and also I never been a fan of marvel's film universe. In the past I like some animation DC and Marvel cartoons. Despite this rarely have some comic adaptation, which I love it, like the V, for Vendetta, or Sin City, or Watchman. Marvel's universe really far from this, but honestly marvel's have a certain style, which is enjoyable but in my opinion a little mediocrit. However, Marvel's have some EPIC films, like the best marvel film, the LOGAN, or Winter Soldier and Civil War which is really good.

Honestly I want to see this film, I don't know why, maybe the hypetrain hit me a bit of.... but I total disappointing after the film. In point of fact, the film is like many other marvel films, a sci-fi/fantasy with superheroes and funny feeling. And in this film, have a very good antagonist.

Bit firsty, technically things total ruined caused by the 30 main charater. The film rushed the scenes, without transitional sceens. Over and above the forced jokes total ruins the drama factor, without the jokes it is maybe works more and more better, I thought. Some main heroes barely can we see, like Steve Rogers, he has 10-15 words in the whole film.

But talk about the antagonist, who is the best character of this marvel universe. He has a good motivation, a - little messy, but - good character development, so he is an interesting character. Nevertheless, he has a interesting but total messy plan, and ideology. Clearly THANOS PLAN IS A Crapshoot! I do not a pacifist, so if he's mayhem works do it, but it isn't.... definitely it is an exact problem, but if anybody have some expertise about History or Geography he knows that this plan isn't works.

The Overpopulation and starvation doesent solved if we cut half the population, it is delayed the problems but doesent solved.",6
Really pretty to look at and...well that's about it.,4 December 2018,"Don't get me wrong. I love the Marvel Universe. I even went back to watch the original Iron Man and forgot that in those days, Disney didn't have their mitts on it yet. It was a Paramount movie. My how times have changed.

For me, the movie was all over the place, jumping from earth, to a distant planet, etc. Yes, the war extends across the galaxy, that much is understood, but too many cross stories, and the entire former Avengers team isn't even together. It does set up the 2nd half that comes out in 2019 which looks lie there will be a head-on face-to-face again with two of the Avengers that split apart, especially since, well, you know why.

All in all, the CGI graphics were excellent. Very top notch. But, a movie can only look so great before it falls under it's own weight, and I'm sorry, but AIW does just that. Editing is sub-par, there are some good one-liners, but I had just watched Ant Man and the Wasp just before this at home and that was a great movie for me. Funny, hilarious and action packed. This, so-so. Disney is trying way too hard here. Need to get back to reality and ground this series back to how it started.

I dare say that AIW is the Marvel Universe's ""The Last Jedi"". Pretty to look at, but empty everywhere else.",4

"Packed with action and comedy, a mind blowing storyline and breaking the cliches while shattering our hearts.",28 April 2018,"Avengers: Infinity War is latest installment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and they have taken an unbelievable and daring step with this movie. Kevin Feige and The Russo Brothers have cooked up a masterpiece, which will keep you at the edge of your seat, and when you least expect, it will send you into a state of denial. An amazing quality of this movie is how unpredictable it is, and what an amazing job Marvel did and keeping the plot a secret until the release, by handing out fake scripts to the actors and whatnot. The special effects, and the CGI in this movie were better than any other movie of the MCU, nothing at all seemed unrealistic (except Proxima Midnight at certain parts of the movie.) Another one of the best things about MCU's latest installment is that although it will be a completely different experience for Marvel fans (people who've watched the movies, who read comics and in a nutshell, know everything one's supposed to know for Infinity War) compared to people who're just watching the movie for the sake of watching such a hyped release, it'll still be pretty amazing for those non-fans. Because they've made the movie in such a way that even a person who knows very less will understand what's happening. Another amazing thing was how they portrayed Thanos. They did it the right way. They made us see his emotions, his reasons for being a genocidal purple egg. MCU has done great with their villains in their past two installments; Thanos and Killmonger. With Hela they didn't really get into depth. And they didn't really show Hela as a person, they just showed her as a mad woman killing for fun and a hunger for the throne and power. But with Thanos and Killmonger, they showed us what they went through to have these motives and aims. They didn't show them as madmen, they showed them as people. Normal people, with normal thought processes, and the ability to feel, which in my opinion is the best thing you can do with a villain; make them as human as possible. Now we get to the quality every MCU movie has; the humor. I think this might be the best Stan Lee cameo for me. And having this ambitious a crossover is difficult, very difficult infact, but they used humor to make the characters go together perfectly. Tony Starks sarcasm, Peter Parker's movie references, Thor not knowing what to say where and Star Lord's (hilarious) narcissism all mixed in perfectly acting as comic relief scenes. And the last of many qualities of this movie; the daring step and breaking the cliche. This movie is not like every other superhero movie, I repeat, it is not like every other superhero movie. It's the biggest Cinematic Event in the history of cinema. And that is for a reason, not just a very grand cast, but an amazing storyline. If you have seen it, you know what I mean, but if you haven't....then I guess you will. As Thanos wants things ""perfectly balanced"", that's what they did with this movie; humor, action, climax and emotion blended into a perfect balance. One of the best movies of the 21st Century, for me.",10
Genuinly incredible they pulled this off,29 April 2018,"I think everyone had extremely high hopes for this movie, but the realist in me expected it to be a literally impossible feat to coordinate this amount of characters in a cohesive story. I know the result is not perfect and a lot of critics complained about pacing issues, but I genuinely believe that they did the best possible job of juggling all these characters. Even movies like civil war which the Russos pulled off incredibly well pale in comparison to the pure amount of material needed in these 2.5 hours, and it's just an absolute thrill to watch everything together come so well. Of course, everyone's talking about the ending and thanos being great, which I obviously agree with, but I think it's important to remember how impossible of a feat this movie truly was, and I can barely wait for next year's conclusion to this epic story.",8

But due to it's EXTREME Overstuffed amount of Marvel Cinematic Universe Lore, Characters, No plot, Little to No ""Technical Science"" at all, with Nothing Solved in the movie's Runtime, it falls short of being a Great Superhero/Comic Book Film.

So was this Movie worth the Decade Wait? Well, let be put it this way, if you only cared or enjoyed Marvel's Movies for the ""Spectacle's"" and ""Marvel Action"" in general with your favorite Superhero characters, This movie is for you, But if your looking forward to a Great Superhero Film, Not mention A Great ""Standalone"", with Great ""Justified"" Action, Drama, and Development. Your going to be disappointed.

Overall, this movie realistically is a gussied-up mediocrity being widely mistaken for an excellent film. It's a Good, Fun, Entertaining, Superhero, Epic, but it's not a Great Movie. Personally, It was Fun, I Yelled and Cheered for my favorite characters with friends in a Sold Out Crowd and that's all I can take away from reflecting on it.

On a final note, I wouldn't put this movie in the same ranks or better than ""Logan"", ""Man of Steel"", ""Wonder Woman"", ""Spider-Man 2"", ""The Dark Knight"", ""The Dark Knight Rises"", or ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" as a Superhero/Comic-book Film Masterpiece. It's a Good Epic Movie worth seeing, but nothing more. (7 out of 10 Stars).",7
"Great cast, great expectations, great dissappointment",28 April 2018,,3
Not a fan of Avengers team but this is a great movie,1 May 2018,"Dear Avengers lovers, this is your month! Avengers: Infinity War is such a great movie, I am not a fan of Avengers movies, but this is definitely a great movie. One week before the movie is released in my country, there are many spoilers, but the movie is still interesting to be watched. The main story of the movie is quite simple, there is a common enemy named Thanos, who wanted to become the greatest god ever in the universe. The first plot is already beginning with a war between the good and the bad, and how the relationship between Avengers team is united easily. Yes, because they face the one and only enemy. In this game, I am quite supporter for Thanos, look at him, he is on war alone with Avengers team. The Director is really genius to use all special effects and other things that made this movie a great superhero series. I hope there is the continuity of the plots, because it has in unexplained ending for me. Even though there is post-credit scene, yet the final war is infinity, well maybe this is the meaning for the title ""Infinity"". In other superhero movies, we could guess that the main evil will be dead or failed, but here in Avengers: Infinity War, the happy ending lovers will be disappointed a lot. Despite of that, I really appreciate all actors and crew, wow they are all seniors and well-experienced, I could not imagine how much they spent for this movie, even though it is clearly stated in IMDB Pro that this is one of box office movies this week, I still could not imagine this movie has great effects and actions. Bravo bravo bravo",9
So excited how it's coming together.,26 August 2018,"Watching all of my favourites coming together on the big screen is exciting as hell. Everytime I saw another hero link up with another I was giggling like a kid. Seriously good movie and time travels way to slowly waiting for these movies to come to fruition, where's Dr Strange when you need him?",8
"My score is a 9.5/10, but I rounded it up to a 10/10",29 April 2018,"Most movies/tv shows don't really make me feel or relate to the characters. But this definitely did. They did such a great job with Thanos. He feels more like an actual character while also being the big-bad CGI villain. He is easily the best Marvel villain. Can't say the same about the Black Order though. Some scenes are almost guaranteed to leave you at the edge of your seat, especially the fight scenes. Those were incredible! This is by far my favorite Marvel movie!

I give it a 9.5/10!",10

Okay for Non-Fans.,26 April 2019,"If you're a superhero-fan, you don't need a review, you will have seen this anyways. For people without this disposition, Infinity Wars is a harder sell.

Best working are the characters. Even though there is an army of support characters, not one feels really cheap and unnecessary. It's a party and as such it feels a little claustrophobic sometimes, but it's still fun.

The story though is a superhero-quagmire. Especially after about half of the movie logic went fully overboard and the plot happens via incomprehensible superhero actions. Time is irrelevant, distances are extremely liquid and neither the MacGuffin nor the relationships of the different ""superhero abilities"" is ever satisfyingly explained. As such drama happens predomantly in the faces of the actors. Visual fidelity distracts from all questions starting with ""why"". It's like you're watching a sport you don't know the rules of - Who is winning? Why was that action helpful? Why is everyone cheering?

If you're new to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, don't start here. The movie strongly presents itself as a chapter of an epic, so you're expected to have a certain idea of the characters to begin with and you won't see real closure unless you plan to visit the next Avenger iteration. And to be honest, i'm not sure this episode warrants the investment, as i had little enthusiasm or emotions for the protagonists and was left observing the spectacle. The humor and the actors save it from becoming another Transformer, but i never felt really engaged.",6
One word: Amazing,5 May 2018,"This movie is the best MCU movie by far. Thanos in this movie was amazing, easily the best villain I've seen in a movie (up there with darth vadar). The story is amazing and if you have watched all the MCU movies prior then you will have no problem in understanding every part of this movie. This movie is more than just an action/superhero movie, it is a really emotional rollercoaster with twists and shocks. Without spoiling anything, this movie will leave you shocked and craving to see what happens next for the avengers and Thanos.",10
It was OKAY.,3 May 2018,"It definitely wasn't as good as a stand alone marvels movie, but it was okay. I thought bk that maybe they should have chosen different directors.",6
Unfinished Worst,2 August 2018,"I wan't planning to waste time writing how boring this overfed turkey is, but then, after hours of ugly nonsense, yawning, waiting for the ex machina that had to be the only possible resolution to this bloated mess, they didn't even bother to conclude.

It's a drokkin' episode.

I've been conned. I'll never spend a cent for Marvel ever again. After 20 years of iron age ennui, just when I fought they were finally bringing some silver age fun with Ant Man and Spiderman, they release their worst soulless product ever, and close it with a big middle finger to our faces.

Just let this company die out, you'll do the world a service.",2
Far better than I could have imagined,21 May 2019,"Even with the Russo brothers directing Infinity War, I was never certain a film could work on this scale. So many sci-fi elements, so many characters... it was so far from the grounded film the Russos made before and Marvel was going into even more bombastic territory than GOTG or the Thor films. What would decide if this film could work was going to be its villain and its usage of its characters. I'm happy to say that it succeeded in all fronts. The pacing in this film is quick and impeccable. Every character gets something to do, albeit some more than others. Its villain, Thanos, is likely the MCU's most compelling villain and the core of the film. He is not only intimidating and dread-inducing, but also sympathetic. This film is also incredibly dark with violent deaths, a grave tone, and writing that lacks much hope. This film has an emotional core, shocking themes, and amazing action. The CGI is fabulous, the score is masterful, and the visuals are eye-popping and wonderful. Infinity War is the best of the Avengers films, and will be remembered for decades as the masterful pinnacle of this cinematic universe, a decade in the making and well worth the wait.",9
Absolutely amazing,28 August 2018,"I went to the cinema expecting this film to be a major flop due to the amount of superheroes were in this film. I thought there was too many how will they make this work. Well with out spoiling anything they made it work and more, easily the best film of the MCU to date",10

There will be no spoilers in this review so sit back and read it without worrying of spoiling your movie. I believe the way they build up Thanos story and story of stones couldn't be done in better way. The movie is above expectations and worth the hype all around the internet and world. Characters were not just for the sake of being in a movie but the characters actually had a part. Not to mention the way movie started already build up so suspense and intrigue that I didn't even went off for drinks during interval, because I cant miss a single detail. The end of the movie was great its just that I this time I am intrigued for ONE year.",10
The most spectacular mcu movie.,20 September 2019,,6
Perfectly fine entertainment,27 April 2018,"I have rated this 5 stars, predominantly because I think 9s and 10s should be provinces reserved for truly great movies. This is an entertaining one, which kept me interested for most of its overlong running time, but which won't leave me with much lingering sense of a tangible movie - it felt like a solid episode in a series I'm binge-watching, but I'll struggle to treasure many specifics of this movie from a line-up of Marvel titles.

There are a ridiculous number of characters in this; the film is using that as its ""event"" selling point, but in truth it was the factor which made me most apprehensive before watching it. To the filmmakers' credit, the juggling of storylines and superheroes (and their endless sidekicks and sub-teams) was almost impressive - it never felt as though many were shoehorned too awkwardly into the forward trajectory of the overall narrative, though some characters - including leading players like Spider-Man and Black Widow - inevitably get shortchanged.

The series' most rewatchable movies - for me Avengers, Winter Soldier, Civil War, Ragnarok and Black Panther - all have something compelling that feels unique to them. I'm not sure this has a unique selling point beyond a huge cast jostling for billing position on the poster, but whilst it plods along it's perfectly decent, and fans of the franchise will likely lap it up.

At the time of writing, the film is ranked number 10 on the IMDb list of the Top 250 movies OF ALL TIME. I'm certain it will plummet once the general public start to supersede the fanboy rush, but this kind of kneejerk over-ranking in the context of cinematic history is a nonsense.",5
The world needs the Avengers,28 April 2018,"It is a very rare occasion feeling like you wish something must be done so the protagonists beat the antagonists in a film. When I watched this, I hoped the Avengers solve this huge and problematic villan they have to defeat. The one that will make them lose all hope just like I felt. And I put all this trust and hope in them. This feeling of imcompletecity and this desire the viewer gets is like nothing before. We seek to see the true heroes they are and how they can succeed in this seemingly impossible victory. Along with this, we have good characters, each with it's memorable and distinct personality, and they all go along well in the story. Accompanied with nice humor and with great action scenes that show unique powers and fights scenes that you even interrupt yourself while eating popcorn",10

Y are there critics on this film?,6 May 2018,"After a reading a negative review or two I really don't understand what goes on in people's mind. After watching avengers infinity war, I can't really describe how epic-much this film is not to mention this is just part 1 of the infinity war. This movie gets straight to the point of having to get everyone back together in hopes of putting an end to thanos before worst comes worst.

Destiny has arrived or is it Disney?,27 April 2018,"A Simple Spoiler free Review before you head out to the movies.

Keeping the hype real, Avengers Infinity war is a stellar portrayal of characters beautifully threaded into a narrative. The Big bad of the movie certainly stands out as one of the biggest and strongest Marvel villain so far. Even though the movie has made changes in the narrative of the villain from it's comic book counterpart, as an actor Josh Brolin delivered what he had to. Drawing parallelism with some of the greatest visionaries of all time (in fiction) such as Ozymandias and Bertrand Zobrist, Thanos believes in the balance of nature and would go any far to control his own OCD mania. Meanwhile the heroes of the universe struggle their best to push their limits so as to stop the Thanos from achieving his mission.

The film is a culmination of ten years worth production under MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe) and goes on portraying an event, more like and end game rather than going for a normative storytelling approach as seen in other Marvel movies. The slight changes from Comic book story line is very well compensated.

As a prelude to the second part of the movie, the film has achieved it's goal while giving the audience a major cliffhanger to ponder upon. The credits scene is missing in the movie, but compensates with a classic post credits scene as Marvel keeps the hopes alive for the upcoming movies",7

"More interesting than most superhero movies, but still has problems",20 May 2018,"Let me start off by saying I thought the movie was good over all. The plot was more complex than that of most Marvel films, the intersections of the Avengers storyline with Black Panther, Doctor Strange, and Guardians of the Galaxy being well-done. The movie had the obligatory Marvel comic relief, but also left plenty of room for tragic moments. The ending was not at all what I expected and is a nice departure from everything-is-undone-in-the-last-20-minutes that many superhero movies feature. The dialogue was witty and for the most part well-written, and the special effects were unbelievably good. My only complaint with this movie is with the pacing. I realize it is supposed to be the big battle Thor Ragnarok (as well as Age of Ultron and Blcak Panther had been leading up to) but the back-to-back action sequences sometimes left me thinking the movie had too little plot spread across too great a time span. I nonetheless enjoyed it and would recommend it to anyone remotely into Marvel.",7
Must watch SCI-FI film series,28 October 2022,"With a brilliantly structured plot, some of the best acting in the MCU, and a good number of truly powerful emotional moments, it's not hard to see why Avengers: Infinity War is Marvel's best film. It has a great story, great acting, and awesome looking. If you aren't a Marvel fan or haven't watched most of the previous MCU movies this however, won't be something for you. The great thing about Infinity War's action-driven storytelling and the fact that the heroes are just delaying an inevitable tragedy with no hope of stopping it is that the whole movie feels like a third act, it felt like the climax of the entire MCU.",8

THANOS ...the best villain ever,27 April 2018,A day after and the movie keeps playing in my mind. Best Marvel movie ever. Thanos was the best villain ever existed on screen. Speechless audience at the end of the movie stack in their seats wondering what just happened..,10
Exceeded my expectation,30 April 2018,"First of all this has to be the best Marvel movie to come out of MCU. Just give it a thought. So many characters to bring on the screen, 150 minutes of runtime. It nevers looks that easy and smooth, right? Well, Russo brothers and Marvel have done an outstanding job to make it possible. During the whole movie, I never felt if any character was underutilized or vice-versa. They have done a fabulous job to fit everyone in the runtime and still keeping it interesting till the very last minute. In most part of the movie, Thanos and his acolytes in the Black Order have the upper hand. But there are a few moments in the movie, where you will not just be happy but also have goosebumps. Trust me, Steve Rogers entry in the movie and Thor's entry in the final battle in Wakanda will give you goosebumps. When I was watching the movie, whole theatre turned into a stadium with the chants and roars for these two beloved superheroes.

Now coming to the bad reviews given to this movie. If it was a happy ending, most of the reviewers here who gave less than 5 stars would have appreciated the movie. Considering that Thanos and Infinity Stones story-arc in the Marvel Cinematic Universe is going to continue in the Avengers 4, its common sense that this one would not have a happy ending. Also, if you haven't seen any other marvel movies and you just watch infinity war for the hype and buzz, you are not going to like it considering the dark nature of the movie. We all know that there has to be some superhero deaths in the movie to make Thanos look most powerful and baddest villian in the MCU. So if the reviewers here do not like the film, they must have not used their common sense or haven't seen the previous movies of the MCU.

I do not want to mention any spoilers here, so I would just like to tell that if you are genuine Marvel fan and have been following the MCU right from the first Ironman movie, then this movie is totally for you. I don't think any Marvel fan would be disappointed with the movie. But if you haven't been following the MCU and are just going to the movie because of all the buzz around you, don't blame it on Marvel Studios or the directors because it's not there fault but yours.",10

Best Marvel Movie So Far,30 April 2018,"I will try to be as vague and spoiler-less as possible.

Let me start out by saying that this movie requires you to watch some of the previous Marvel movies to be fully enjoyed.

Infinity War was a great cinema flick which I feel is VERY re-watchable considering the sheer number of characters/actors in it.

Great beginning, middle and end. Very humorous and interesting to see the different characters interacting with each other.

There are a few ""stereotypical"" moments which is to be expected but overall a great movie.

Keep in mind that it is a part 1 movie, so before fully judging it I feel I need to see part 2 also.

I might be tempted to watch this again in the cinema which would make it the first movie (at least which I can remember) that I have seen and paid for twice in the cinema.

If you are a Marvel Movie fan you probably already seen it, if you aren't I highly suggest you see some of the previous Marvel movies beforehand.

All in all, great movie, but requires some knowledge of the universe to be fully enjoyable.",9

Mixed tbh,29 April 2018,"I feel iw was way too predictable, I kinda feel like I knew what was going to happen straight away. There were no real defining moments for me where I was on the edge of my seat or where I was shocked.",6
Much better than expected,26 August 2018,"I have not had a huge vested interest in all of the Marvel movies that lead up to this big one but I have seen them all. However I did enjoy the last Thor film and I was suprised how much I liked the last Guardians of the Galaxy film. So that's where I am in all this, I'm not the biggest Marvel fan and can't remember half of what has happened in the last 18 movies but I like elements of them a lot and I do tend to watch them all on bluray release dates.

Infinity War however just sucked me in. I didn't think it was over saturated by the quantity of Characters, somehow it just worked. Doctor Strange and the Guardians of the Galaxy were introduced in to the story well and although I'm not the biggest Marvel fan I knew what was happening the whole of the time. This is the biggest thing that Marvel has ever done and they weren't afraid to take risks. I also feel that raising the humour level like they are is the right thing to do.

This film ends like no other super hero film has ever ended. When it first ended I felt sad that there wasn't more but after 2 and a half hours surely if I felt like I wanted more then this means that it really did suck me in, I could have easily sat there for another 2 hours to see some sort of closure.

So now I can't wait for the 4th Avenger movie, I have never waited in anticipation for a Marvel film like it before. In the mean time, I may actually go back and rewatch the other Marvel films which I didn't think I would ever do again.",9

Do you like a lot of fighting? This might be for you,29 April 2018,"Short review:

Honestly, this movie was spectacular to look at. The visuals were outstanding and from that point of view, it gets a 9/10 (nothing is ever perfect).

But.. From my own point of view, regarding the movie as a whole, it gets a 6,5/10. Throughout the whole movie, they were just fighting.. And fighting.. And fighting. The story evolved and then they kept on fighting. Some people might like this and get excited by it, but not me. I do recommend watching it if you like superheroes or movies with a lot of special effects, but (a lot of ""buts"") for me it got way too much.",6
Just...Wow!!,27 April 2018,"This movie...no words can describe how amazing it is. You will experience every emotions at the same time, that is how powerful this movie is. All of their acting is extraordinary, so you'll understand how their character feels. At the end of the movie you will just sit there thinking: what the hell is happening when can I see Avengers 4. This movie is so hard to describe because that is how amazing it is, and you'll understand what I mean when you watch it...so watch it!!!",10
Very entertaining,27 April 2018,"Was as funny as any Marvel movie but definitely not funnier. I choked up more during this than during any other Marvel movie. Higher stakes and loss equals more emotion. Tons of action. Cliffhanger at the end leaves you wondering what's next. Best villain of any Marvel movie, by far. I still feel like there were some missed opportunities, but the job the Russos did of juggling this many characters and keeping it this good is quite a feat.",7

A New Excitable Film Inside MCU,7 April 2019,"1. Thanos is the greatest villain in the MCU! With believable motivations, depth, and just a great performance in the film.

2. This movie is exciting! This movie feels like a hype train leaving the station all the way throughout. It makes you happy, emotional, and at the edge of your seat!

3. The greatest action sequence since Civil War! The Wakkanda sequence is action packed, energized, tense, and every character has a moment to shine.

4. Gamora is SO MUCH MORE DEVELOPED! They took an ok character, to one of the highlights of the film! Some great acting comes from Zoe in this movie!

A Few Complaints:

1. Thor's subplot is incredibly BOOORING! Think how cool it would have been to shoot lightning like in Ragnarock, but they take a step back and give him another hammer.

But How?,24 April 2019,"Great cast and Amazing CGI. Story line has too many holes to even summarize. Fight scenes, especially with Thanos, are shockingly unimaginative. Where is the thoughtful use of each hero's superpowers to push Thanos to the brink of defeat? How many times is somebody going to try and hit him on the chin only for it to be shrugged off? C'mon. $300M+ budget needs to go into thoughtful writing like what as done with the depth of Thanos character to make this the masterpiece it should be. All that said. Solid 8 star and great movie. Could have been a real classic and not just a blockbuster.",8
It's been 12 hours since I left the cinema and nothing but Infinity War has occupied my thoughts.,27 April 2018,"The sheer scale of this film made me sceptical of it at first. I knew I was going to love it being a massive Marvel nerd, but I did have worries about it feeling a bit over-saturated and disjointed, given the huge number of characters.

Thankfully, the Russo brothers have pulled this off in almost flawless fashion. Each story arc is seamlessly blended together, while we focus moreso on the impending threat of Thanos, than any individual hero's story. This gives this film an incredibly different feel to the formula that we've grown to expect from Marvel, in that the single most important character is the antagonist, which subsequently means that he gets more development than anyone else. This is a more than welcome change if you ask me, as it serves as a good counter-measure to the lack of great villains in the MCU. Brolin breaks the tradition with his portrayal of Thanos, a super villain to which we relate in ways, who's point we see and last but not least - who feels like an ENORMOUS threat to the entire universe that we love. Just how much of a threat is very well established in the opening scenes.

As the film progresses it jumps from character to character, or rather group to group, as separate teams each have their own parts to play in the upcoming showdown. This in no way damages the story-telling, and the Russo brothers deserve a huge amount of credit for how they managed to keep it so coherent, despite the events taking place across multiple planets, at the same time. Stylistically it does what every great marvel film does, it mixes a perfect blend of humour and action, becoming more serious when it needs to be... in moments that become more and more frequent the deeper you get. This film will make you feel every emotion you could imagine, especially if you're already invested in the universe and it's characters.

It's worth noting that the chemistry between some of the characters that we've never seen together is nothing short of brilliant! Doctor Strange and Tony Stark clash, as do Stark and Peter Quill, The Hulk has some hilarious moments and Thor, Rocket and Teenage Groot make for a highly amusing trio! There are bucket loads of cross-overs here, as expected, each and every one of which makes for seriously entertaining viewing!

I don't want to include spoilers in this review, but this film takes what we've come to expect, laughs at it, and does the exact opposite. As the title states, it's been 12 hours (more than that now) and I still can't stop thinking about what I witnessed in the cinema last night. I don't think anybody will be quite ready for the way it ends. It will leave you begging for answers and questioning everything. Be warned, you may leave the cinema emotionally drained, but you will leave more satisfied than ever.

I rated this 10/10 but I don't really think any movie deserves a perfect 10. This is a 9.5 for me. Easily top 3 Marvel films of all time. Potential candidate for the best, and definitely up there with the greatest superhero films of all time.",10

I feel the film was well planned, good effects, Ofcourse it had a very good budget. I really loved how the characters were engaged and also how all these storylines from other films where brought into play. I feel that they got the spotlight they deserve, how they interacted. I feel like every part of the movie was very planned and loved seeing how everything came together. I would rewatch it over and over again. The ending was spot on for me, It very emotional that it got me all teary and happy at the same time.",6

You must be a die hard Marvel fan to appreciate this,6 August 2018,"I'm not really a Marvel fan, but I did enjoy some of their movies and like some of their characters. Apparently this movie is a culmination of all the previous storylines in the Marvel universe, so this time they made sure to _really_ go over the top with it to please the fans. All your favorite characters are there doing their own thing to fight against the main villain in an end game that feels like it's 7 hours long.

With so many characters and so many parallel storylines I found it hard to focus or care about anything and just tuned out, like when you're watching a very long battle in a Transformers movie that has no consequences whatsoever and the movie loses you and you start to ask yourself why you're not doing anything useful with your life instead of watching that nonsense.

It's probably just me as I'm not really interested in this universe in general and the main villain is kind of disappointing in my opinion, but be warned, if you're not a die hard fan either, you will probably be bored to death just like me.",3

Avengers: Infinity War is probably one of the best movies of 2018,18 August 2018,"Avengers: Infinity War, in my opinion, is the best movie in the Avengers universe. I was never a huge Marvel fan, I always enjoyed watching any Avengers film, but I was COMPLETELY and UTTERLY blown away after seeing Avengers: Infinity War. There's only a small list of movies that have taken my breath away after seeing them, and Infinity War is definitely one of them. From the incredible cast and character list, to the memorizing special effects, Avengers: Infinity War does not shy away from moments that make you rethink everything you have known about the Marvel Universe. One of my favorite parts about Avengers: Infinity War is the score, it really helped tie in the special effects in addition to the story-line, which contained both dramatic and comical scenes. The one thing you need to know is that the ending will truly, mess. you. up. Even if you are not a fan of the Avengers and you see this movie, you will still feel shocked. I definitely recommend seeing Avengers: Infinity War.",10
Impossible to forget,1 January 2019,"I gave this movie 8/10 to Begin with. Now i have given it a few Months to really sink in and i simply have to give it 9/10 simply due to the fact that i still vividly remember it.

The pacing is slow and it takes it's time to show All the different plot lines slowly merch together as the film comes to an end. Yet, it does not feel slow. It moves along constanly and not a minute is wasted. You are never bored and your mind is constantly racing trying to piece everything together.

Thanos is both charismatic and yet very frightening. The acting from Josh Brolin is phenomenal and the motion-capture is actually flawless.

The battles are engaging and large, yet they still feel small and down to earth, which gives the film a very nice feel and style.

The cinematography is absolutely astonishing, and the set design, costume work and overall look alone, is enough to Sell this movie.

Avengers Infinity War can both be watched as a thoughtful and emotional film, and fun movienight entertainment.

9/10 one of 2018s most memorable movies...",8
This One Is About The Ending,10 April 2021,"It feels like years in the making to get to the final 2 films. The question being, has it been worth it?

I think you would have to say yes. Its an impressive effort from Marvel to bring everything together in these final 2 movies.

It ticks all the boxes that would be expected visually and aurally so we don't need to really discuss these elements.

#1 Superhero Movie and top 15 all time no debate!!!,30 August 2022,"This movies marketing even started off great. The trailer for Infinity War is the most watched on youtube ever. I remember coming out otf theatres with a feeling I've never had after watching a movie in theatres before. Not a single scene was wasted in my opinion. This movies is far superior to Endgame in my opinion because of the real stakes, Thanos, and character arcs (mainly Thor and Iron Man). The action is phenomenal and the fight vs Thanos is far superior to the cgi blob in Endgame. I know some people might say Dark Knight or Logan is greatest cmic book movie ever and while that is fair due to the themes those movies have, I don't think its a debate for most entertaining. The pacing, story, shocks, and characters are all amazing. It paid off on the build up and I would've been fine with the MCU ending here. If it continued I wished it would of been as prequels or a world after half the population was eliminated. The two stand outs for me are Thanos and Thor. Both on a journey leading them to each other at the end. Thors arc was phenomal and proved a comedic character can turn into a real and depressed one real quick. The pay off (wakanda entrance) is the greatest movies scene ever in my opinion even though Captain America lifting Mjolnir made me happier in the moment. I get goosebumps every time the Wakanda scene comes on tv. This movie turned thanos intomy favorite villain of all time as well as a top 10 movie one no doubt. He is menacing, worked for everything he achieved, surprising (like throwing Gamora off cliff), and sympathetic at times. The resect he gives to opponents makes him respectful in some of the audience's eyes. What a movie.",10

ANOTHER SPECTACULAR MARVEL MASTERPIECE,21 April 2020,"Infinity War is another spectacular piece of filmmaking & another amazing Avengers movie with all the star studded cast of characters we love. End Game was an easy 10/10 instant epic Classic & so is Infinity war, the special effects are fantastic as always & the action is incredible & the great characters all get some real time to shine with that hilarious banter & humour that the Avengers are known for but also the stakes are much higher here & the danger is even more deadlier for our heroes.

The evil Thanos is collecting up his Infinity stones & will destroy anyone in his path with his deadly army & he's here on earth causing mega destruction & all our heroes come together & join forces in an epic battle of good vs evil to save our world.

I loved this movie so much & it's a huge big budget blockbuster movie, a beautiful fantasy adventure that is ridiculously entertaining & fun. I love big popcorn movies & comic book movies & I've loved nearly all the MCU flicks that I've seen & Infinity War is probably my favourite of the Avengers films & one of the best Marvel has made. The cinematography is gorgeous & the music theatrical & exciting & i loved having the Guardians of the galaxy back here & of course the hilarious Thor steals the show alot with his hilarious attitude & kick-ass fighting, i love that dude but all the characters do get a great scene or more to do their stuff.

That being said I do want to give a strong recommendation to Infinity War for any fans of this franchise, it's funny it's heartfelt and it go's to some unexpected places. Despite a couple of moments when a character says or does something a little out of character for them and some hard to follow moments of action this is a great movie.

Rewind will Undo Everything..,7 May 2018,"Unfortunately it is clear that the compelling story that was told will be completely undone by some sort of rewind in the universe bringing back all dead people.

The moment you realize this will be the case the movie loses all of its value and you stop caring what will happen from that point on making whole movie essentially obsolete.

I wish they would stick with consequences so that I could take the movie seriously, but it is clear they will not. I feel really bad about that part because if it weren't for the above downside it was actually a good movie. Well planned story, a villain that is not one dimensional (a real problem in overwhelming majority of marvel movies) and beautiful execution.

Only real downside movie had was the number of characters in the movie rendered most of those characters into extras. If we were to cut them out of the movie, or just replace them with generic extras instead nothing would have changed plot-wise. But aside from that there was no problems with the movie and it was beautiful.

I just wish it wasn't just gonna be rewind and undone, but sadly it will.",8
"You know thanos is greek for death, don't you?",24 October 2018,"We don't like Marvel movies, but we did like the guardians of the galaxy, so we dutifully watched this one. All the best parts were connected to G of G and now we don't even want to watch Black Panther anymore. It's hard to write a review without spoilers and we did appreciate that watching television hadn't given away everything in this movie.

It pretty funny to think Death needs super powers when it already rules all and everything and they ignore his siamese twin, Food. Some parts were entertaining and emotionally effective, but mostly it was frustrating to watch. Most things that are consumable for life come from other life.

However, there is something Thanos doesn't know that everyone should . History shows that when humanoid societies achieve the level where women have access to education and birth control reproduction slows down below replacement levels. That is why materialist societies need immigration to maintain themselves. Then the immigrant birthrate goes down, too, even among the Irish. This happened to Rome and has happened to Europe and us.

Another thing he doesn't get is that humanoid technology can increase the sustainability of an environment. Sometimes I think that consciousness, if it has a Purpose, was created, if it was created, was created by the Universe in hopes it would find some way to hold the universe together or make little bubbles of continuity with some sort of gravity pump. Just because we are currently a parasitic society doesn't mean all intelligent beings are. At this rate we will be back to living in caves before we manage to master space flight and threaten the universe, so Thanos should calm down.",7

It shows the difficulty of making decisions and is a little emotional as well. A great story line and plot. The graphic imagery and cinematography is beyond WOW. It's one of the best MCU films I have ever seen. And every avenger gets an equal chance of lines and acting in the film. It's not that only one avenger gets a chance. A really beautiful creation. Worth watching. I agree that its just a little bit long but totally worth the time. Again this is all Thanos's game.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!!!",9
I left the theater speechless...,27 April 2018,"SPOILER FREE!!!! DO NOT LET ANYONE SPOIL THIS MOVIE FOR YOU!!!!!

So it's officially been 10 years since the MCU has begun (he takes a short break to let out a little cry as he realizes how effing old he is) and more or less I've really enjoyed the films. There have been a couple I wasn't a fan of, and honestly there were only a few I absolutely loved, but this one. THIS ONE! This is Marvels answer to Nolan.

First off, I was amazed at how well the directors and writers balanced the tone and characters. No characters are shoved to the side, they all have ample screen time and serve their purpose. And every time a new character shows up it legitimately feels like their movies tone. When youre with Dr. Strange it feels like his movie, when you're with the Guardians it feels like their movie and so on and so forth. It astounds and impresses the hell out of me that the Russo Brothers were able to pull this off so seamlessly and have it not feel jumbled or clunky, especially seeing as there are so many characters to juggle.

But yeah, let's talk about the big guy. Thanos. Now I think it's safe to say the weakest part of the MCU has been their villains, again with a couple exceptions i.e. Loki and Killmonger, but Thanos is easily the best of the entire series and one of the best villains I've ever seen in a movie. Why??? Because he's actually a character!!!!! He's not just some mindless thug looking to destroy the universe because bad guy plot, he's a real, fleshed out character with a tragic background and emotions. There are times when he doesn't want to do the things he's doing but feels he needs to because what he's doing is the best thing for the universe, and while he's clearly insane and evil, you see through his eyes so much it's hard not to empathize with the guy.

This movie is big. It's grand. It's epic on a Lord of the Rings scale. It's funny when it needs to be and it's serious when it needs to be. It perfectly balances all these likable and well developed characters perfectly and has one of the greatest villains in cinema history. There's no other word for it: Avengers - Infinity War is a damn masterpiece that might just dismantle The Dark Knight as my favorite comic book movie. Without a doubt this movie gets a perfect 10/10.",7
A brainless & cringeworthy cliché fest,2 August 2018,"Since i am not a little boy that has an absurd kind of fondness for Marvel comics & thus its movies, i am able to judge them objectively without being prejudiced by a couple of adults flying around in capes. And with this knowledge, it is quite obvious that Infinity War is indeed objectively a terrible movie.

As stated before i am admittedly not a Marvel fan, and i did not care to watch any of its predecessors before this one. It ofcourse should never be a requirement to watch about 18 films in order to comprehend this one better, but to be honest you really don't miss anything during Infinity War's simplistic narrative if you have missed all its previous films, except for maybe knowing the characters in it. But judging from what i have seen none of them are even slightly relatable even when having watched previous films. So even if you have watched previous films, a connection with these characters is impossible since they are so terrible written and often times poorly acted.

First off, i cannot fathom enough how terrible the screenplay is. A couple of characters try to be funny and come up with lines of dialogue a 8 year old could have though of, such as: 'Dude, you're embarrassing me in front of the wizards' or 'Why is Gamora', or the discussion about Thor's new haircut. The plain stupidity in its dialogue and writing is basically an insult to the audience's intelligence, and thus it is a very dumb and low IQ motion picture due to this. The acting is mostly terrible, except by perhaps Josh Brolin ( Which is saying a lot, since he was a pure CGI character ). Especially Robert Downey Jr, Chris Pratt & Tom Holland all hand in absolutely atrocious and horrendous performances. All of them try to be funny and joke around in serious times, but it is never funny, instead its terrible pretentious attempt at creating wisecracks results in loads of cringeworthy scenes that will make the audience embarrassed to witness. Although in the three actors's defence, the abysmal script didn't help their performances either, and they are only partly to blame.

The only interesting character in the film is Thanos, and while it does help a little bit that he has the most screen time of all characters by far, he still seems to be a victim of the cliché fest that is Infinity War since his reasons for wanting to take over the world are hardly original ( Sacrifice the few to save the many kind of motivations, which we have all seen before ), and can probably be found in the 'Standard Hollywood villain rules guide book' anywhere. None of the 'Good guys' are relatable because their dialogue is so ridiculous and since the only intelligent person in the film seems to be Thanos, as everybody else seems to be lacking in self awareness and self consciousness on every level ( Especially all the times people who know what Thanos is capable of keep attacking him like they think they have a chance, what a joke that is ).

There is once again a lot of sub par plastic cinematography with many artificial backdrops, especially in Wakanda. None of it seems particularly natural, and thus the film also has this visually artificial kind of feel that further decreases your immersion ( Although the characters already decreased this pretty far down with their terrible dialogue ). There is no depth or real sub text in the film except perhaps Thanos showing little Gomora his knife balancing which symbolizes his view of a world in balance, but that is pretty much all the cleverness in it. It also has a lot of melodramatic scenes ( Especially with Vision and that redhead woman whose name i forget ) between characters that you cannot relate with, and the only thing that i wanted to see happen was Thanos killing them all, as he was the only individual with even a slightly bit of depth or character, thus making only him, the villain, relatable. Ofcourse as is standard in modern films Infinity War is also very politically correct in that it uses a lot of women warriors fighting like men against eachother in order to negate gender differences like there are none, which further enhances the notion that this is ultimately an irrelevant film.

Admittedly the only strength this film might have comes from Thanos's character, and everything else seems irrelevant due to terrible acting & writing. In the end, despite that a lot of characters meet their demise, it still feels as though nothing is really at stake because all the characters are frequently making unfunny jokes & dumb decisions, which in turn leads to the question: 'Why should we care?'",4

Best superhero movie,26 August 2018,This movie is like heaven to superhero fans...... Thats it,10
What we've all been waiting for,1 May 2018,"I can't help but think of 'Star Wars: The Last Jedi' after watching 'Avengers: Infinity War.' The two of them may have been made by Disney, but they are worlds apart when it comes to giving the fans what they were after. The latest 'Star Wars' may have been okay, but it was generally disregarded by many die-hards. However, despite the Avengers - technically - pumping out more films in its franchise and therefore potentially suffering from fatigue regarding its premise, it's been hailed as a classic - and for good reason. It shows that, despite having numerous previous (and dare I say similar?) outings, a sequel doesn't have to be stale.

I suppose there must be some people out there who have never seen an 'Avengers' movie before (or even one from the Marvel Cinematic Universe), so, for the two of you, this is the third outing where Earth's mightiest superheroes are forced to come together to defend the planet from an alien, hell-bent on wiping out 50% of the universe.

You may be thinking that this is just another modern action film, filled with computer-generated special effects and scripted one-liners. And you'd be right. However, I always find that computer-generated battles are only bad if the effects are bad and they drag on and scripted one-liners only don't work if they're forced and there's no chemistry between the actors. I'm pleased to say that, although 'Avengers: Infinity War' has both, they only add to the proceedings.

With a cast as big as is needed to bring characters from every Marvel movie together, there's always going to be a couple who don't get quite as much screen time as some of us would like. However, you should really expect that and realise it was going to be difficult for the writers to please everyone. Personally, I've always been a fan of Robert Downey Jr's portrayal of 'Iron Man' (I don't think I'm alone on that one), so I was happy to see that he was - possibly - given the most screen time out of anyone.

However, no matter how good the goodies are, they need a good bad-guy to fight. The Marvel movies have often been criticised for a lack of real threatening baddies (Loki excluded), so we finally get to see he who has been in the background for so long, Thanos. And he's worth the wait. He's a bad guy we can not only love to hate, but also - in a strange way - see that he has a point, or at least a point of view from his own perspective. Josh Brolin portrays him brilliantly and you'll forget that most of him is computer-generated after a while.

Yes, 'Infinity War' is part of the overall franchise, but you don't really have to have seen every previous movie to 'get' everything that's happening here (obviously, the more Marvel movies you've seen the more you'll get out of this one, but it's not essential). I suppose if there is one complaint of mine it's that I know which characters are truly in danger here, due to the actors' contracts either due to expire, or only just being picked up. Either way, it's a definite improvement on the previous 'Avengers' movie, as the 'Age of Ultron' felt strangely 'meh' for one that should have been so much more.

If you like the MCU, you'll like this. If you like action film, you'll also love it. It's - sort of - a family movie in that a lot of families will go to see it, but, either way, it's so epic in scale that most should appreciate it for the sheer spectacle it is. Poor Justice League - it never really stood a chance.",10
Left Speechless with Looming Questions,30 April 2018,"One can say that for ten years running the Marvel Cinematic Universe continues to amaze and their latest installment 'Avengers: Infinity War' is a constant reminder that these characters have leapt out of their comic book pages and onto the big screen. With an all-star cast of familiar names and faces gracing the screen like Robert Downey Jr, Chris Hemsworth, Chris Pratt, Benedict Cumberbatch, Scarlett Johansson, and many others, I couldn't fathom how much they went through to finally come together in one movie. Director Joss Whedon helped kick off two Avengers films in 2012 and 2015, but thanks to brothers Joe and Anthony Russo (Captain America: Winter Soldier, Captain America: Civil War) they've pushed it further with these established characters and have a story worth telling.

With the Mad Titan Thanos (Josh Brolin) unleashing destruction in his wake to gather all the Infinity Stones that the heroes have kept safe in the past, it's up to the Avengers to join forces with the Guardians of the Galaxy to stop him at all cost.

The Russo Bros. did an excellent job in directing and gathering all these actors who not only gave splendid performances, but had its audience immerse themselves into a whirlwind of triumph and tragedy. Compared to a few past MCU titles, 'Infinity War' had the right balance of both witty humor and drama blended well into the action that it didn't derail the story itself. It kept me intrigued and curious to see what its mythos and pathos can do. When the movie ended, it had me left speechless and with so many questions looming over what lies ahead. I've heard some complaints from some people I've met saying they didn't like it because it didn't flesh out all the characters properly, missing other notable heroes, or lacked depth in the film's story, but I beg to differ. Since this is only the first half, surely its second half will bring this story to a decent close. My only nitpick was indeed that a few other heroes didn't show, but that's okay since they could likely be saved for its follow-up. Compared to past MCU villains, I was intrigued with the directors' approach in making Thanos being more than just a typical power-hungry villain, but somewhat sympathetic as well. Music composer Alan Silvestri's underscore is a brilliant accompaniment to the most pivotal scenes too. To close, this movie is, by far, a culmination of Marvel's wide assortment of heroes raising the bar in their shared universe. Only time will tell on what more can Marvel dish out from here beyond this Phase Three.

The works of Stan Lee, Jack Kirby, and Joe Simon are now more than just drawings on comic book pages, they are embodiments who've made their mark in cinema.",8
An Honest Review from a Non-Marvel Fan,7 May 2018,,7
Packs a Solid Punch before the ultimate finale,1 September 2018,"This movie is beyond awesome, and I call it awesome not just because I have to, as so many people have liked and given crazy 10 ratings. I genuinely feel it is. I think the Russo brothers have done a commendable job in bringing so many superheroes in one film and Indeed it must have been crazy. One wrong move and it could just go wrong. Remember how Spiderman 3 and The Amazing Spiderman 2 went wrong in the similar manner. The directors just couldn't work with the idea of using multiple villians in the script. Thankfully that does not happen here. There are many superheroes and many supervillians and works just fine. Credit should go to screenwriters because the main job is always handled by them.

The biggest strength of this film is that you don't have to watch the previous MCU movies to understand the storyline. urrmm..ok you must watch some movies but not entirely because I haven't seen myself. And it was one of the reasons why I was a bit doubtful whether I would like the film or not as I am having the lack of knowledge. But the makers have pulled off a superb job. The film is so gripping from start to finale you won't even care what happened previously. Every character is well defined and moves you. Heck! didn't even watch the two galaxy movies before this film but still could understand everything. That's the magic this film got.

People hating on the ending especially on Quill's part is childish and annoying. Quill loved Gamora to the extent that he could not lose her. His action was understandable and inevitable. Ditto for the part of Thanos, He had to be victorious, and its fine considering the next movie is coming next year (fingers crossed)

Coming to performances, everyone has given their best foot forward. But I have my favourites. Josh Brolin as Thanos dominates the show with a commanding presence and engaging act while the best performance comes from Zoe Saldana as Gamora, She moves you completely and takes this film to an time high, kudos to the makers who thought of giving her such a strong arc this time. The next day I watched Both guardian movies and her performance in those films were nothing to write home about. So yeah ! Gamora rules

Next comes Okoye, she was simply fantastic as the General of The Wakanda Army. Her role is quite short but she manages to make a mark ditto for Nebula who is striking in a small role. Emotionally distraught, she is ready to take on her evil step father even if it means her death. Last Comes Black Widow who sadly didn't get much to do not even proper fight scenes she is known for. But her presence is enough to ensure light. Rest all were great. I wouldn't call this one a masterpiece but its certainly a great piece of cinema. Go Watch it !",8

Magnificent Marvel Performance 10/10,10 March 2019,"I am truly impressed with this movie and I thought that this one would have win an Oscar. I was especially blown away with Thanos and his Malthusian Theory. Although he was referring the all the population throughout the different universes, he has truly painted a factual picture about of life and the suffering of the population in planet Earth. I agree that it is a sad concept but his ideas and speech was very deep and quite concerning. Although I would not like to see half of the population get wiped away :D

Thank you Stan Lee for your most remarkable creations and I sincerely hope you will rest in peace and will find comfort and joy in the heavenly stars above. :')",10
The only reason it is rated so high is for the ending.,26 February 2021,"Because nothing else in this movie makes sense. Purple dude looks for rocks and tries to be scary. Things happen. Heroes change all the rules around about what powers they have and why. More things happen. Oh yeah, spider man can survive in space without oxygen. Bunch of guys fight purple dude instead of going to the other side of the galaxy and hiding. Some stuff happens. Purple guy is sad. Random generic battle at the end with an extremely random army of space dogs that lasts way to long because the earth guys are incompetent. Some more dudes fight purple guy and should have no chance at killing him but somehow don't die instantly. Ending is pretty cool. Kansas would be proud. Also Tyrion Lannister just shows up for no reason.",7

If does for you what you wanted,5 May 2018,"See this as soon as possible if you care enough to read reviews. This movies impact is in your unpreparedness!!! The Interstellar of comic book movies. It moves fast. It tackles enormous plot points, throws all the heroes into the storyline with thrust yet with finesse and comedic touch. 5 story lines converge and collapse into 4, then 3, then 2, boiling over into an intense, sometimes shuttering series of climaxes. This is then reduced down to a concentrated chapter of events that will leave the outside viewers and fans alike giddy and shaken. Sit back and enjoy the new canvas the directors and writers splatter, like bright paint, both nostalgia and Fresh life with our characters.

This is NOT age of ultron. This avengers is to avengers 1 what ragnorak was to Thor 1, except with everybody youve been waiting to see again, plus guardians, plus mystic arts, plus an antagonist that shouldn't even be called a movie villain, but an inevitable turning point character.

The best superhero movie since Logan,27 April 2018,,8
Sina's review over Avengers:Infinity War,15 December 2021,"The film is good for those in the age range of 9-15. Full of unreasonable action, bright colors, video and sound effects, and things that are made in studios. Lots of unnecessary characterization. Lots of unneeded drama. A melange of characters to make Hollywood richer and help it have a sequel or a threequel.

It's good for dreamers, imaginative people and those who believe in superpower and heros. Not for those who ponder, critique and look for reasonable sequences. A popcorn film to watch with your young friends, not recommended for lovers.",6
A truly masterpiece.,27 April 2018,"The film is all that Marvel has promised and more. Incredible from start to finish, tense, exciting and emotional moments. Thanos is the greatest villain in film history, well developed and motivated, he is so sadistic and remarkable, and Josh Brolin's performance was fantastic. The CGI is perfect.",10
Still confused,8 April 2020,"It's funny how I thought it was a disgrace of a film when my friend took me to the theatre to see it, but after a few years it still sticks because of how Thanos is projected as villain and slowly I'm starting to wonder if he is. I wonder if - would this story be told again in a few decades - he would be a hero for taking on such a task.",7
2 and a half hours of my life I can't get back,3 May 2018,Who wants to go to a movie when they feel worse at the end than they do when they come in? The ending ruins the film and tries to hook you into seeing part 2. I will wait until it makes it to the small screen. I won't lay down good money to feel bad. Nice effects but storyline just sucks. I can't believe all the high ratings.,1

"Very good, but choses to miss greatness (EDITED after 2nd viewing)",25 April 2018,"EDIT after second viewing today.

I liked it a lot more today, mainly because I saw the movie for what it is, and not for what I intended it to be. I could easily change my score to a 9/10, but it probably would not be fair. Undoubtly stands the test of multiple viewings, very good movie overall.

The board was set, the pieces were ready, but an unfortunate lack of ambition and commitment prevented this movie from living up to the marketed premise, thus failing to deliver the much needed and desired ten year emotional punch.

It's still a very good movie, in its own merits. The very best action scnenes, the jaw dropping cinematography (Imax 3d showcase!), a beautiful and emotionally soundtrack.

The movie tries its best to handle the various groups of characters, but clocking at 150 minutes, there is only so much one can fit in. Precious minutes are sometimes wasted in rather poor and awkward atempts of comic relief that overstay their presence. Some characters do not get enough screen time, it was never going to be easy to fit everyone in, but there were clearly questionable decisions, pacing problems and unwanted discrepancy.

Thanos character is one of the highlights, and is handled quite nicely, although his origin has been cut from the movie, Even so, we can clearly understand what and why he wants to do. One of the very best Marvel villains. As it also happens in the comics, Thanos shows a lack of competence in handling his growing powers, being seemingly allmighty in one scene, and a juvenile brawler in the next. This movie did not fulfill my - high! - expectations, and it's sad to know it failed to do so due to a ""creative"" vision that fell short of the ultimate ambition the movie required. Anyway, still a pretty good superhero blockbuster, one of the better Marvel films (not on the very top tier, though) and highly recommended to not only comic book nerds as myself, but also to the general fantasy/action/sci-fi movie audience.

8/10 (as a long time Marvel fan, I truly wish I could rate this movie higher, but honestly and sadly.... can't.)",8

Great Movie,15 May 2018,"I think Marvel should have made a solo Thanos movie before infinity war. They could easily started this movie with Thanos having 2 or 3 Infinity Stones already.

Hated the ending,22 May 2018,,7
Anything less than 8......,28 April 2018,"If anyone rate this movie less than an 8, probably never rated a movie above an 8 in their life. For those who rated 3 and below, probably never even seen the move yet or they watched a bootleg copy.

This movie is a 10 all the way across the board. From the beginning to the end, this movie captures the moment, while seizing the day. I'm already considering going to see it again.",10
Not a bad movie.. but not a pleasant ending,17 October 2018,,7
Terrible,5 May 2018,"If I am to get to the point, the movie was noisy audibly and visually. It felt like a Michael Bay movie where he creates a false sense of excitement by wildly swinging the camera around with nauseating shots that last a few split seconds, leaving the viewer confused as to what is happening on screen. There's a balancing point in a movie with CGI and this movie has too much of it. Nothing feels real or organic. Much of the movie is like watching a children's morning cartoon. Too much was crammed into the movie. Every minute you're in a new area in space or on a ship. I savoured the non action scenes where people were talking to each other. Wakanda? I never read the Black Panther comics and I am not sure if the movie represents the comics, but wow, what an embarrassing part of the movie for black people. These Africans are so advanced that they fly spaceships and tell Bruce Banner, a genius, his folly in relation to brain surgery while working on Vision. Is this supposed to come across as condescending to blacks because it was super cringe-worthy. I mean, it's kinda like dressing up a 5-year old as a professor and telling him he is the smartest person on the planet. And for these people to be so advanced, why are they using spears? I realise why Black Panther was always a 3rd tier comic now. Anyhow, there are some good parts in the movie, but it's rushed and just awful. I preferred Justice League as a movie; the pacing was a lot better.",4
The hype is real! Still in awe,25 April 2018,"Spoiler free Simply EPIC!!! I hardly write any reviews, I read them. I felt compelled to write a review for this movie.

I'm still processing what I've seen and I can tell you one thing, the hype paid off, big time. I'm really an MCU-fan and have watched every movie prior this one and all these movies accumulate in this one.

The cast, the acting, the cgi, it's all top notch. Thanos really is bada** and I think together with Hela, the best villain I've ever seen. This movie gave me all the emotions from thrilled, sad, hope and awe.

I'm going to watch this 150-minute movie again really soon, there is so much in it that can't be seen in one go.

If you like MCU, this is the mother of it all. You'll most definitely like this one.

Can't believe when I say that I'm looking forward to the sequel.

Best movie in ages, a job very well done!",10
Marvel's Best Film Yet!,15 May 2018,"From the opening moments to the last frame of the end credits scene, Avengers: Infinity War will blow you away. After ten years of films leading up to this moment, we finally get to see Thanos in action and he does not let down. Played by Josh Brolin, Thanos is above and beyond the best villain that the MCU has had to date. And when you get to the end of the film, you will be picking your jaw up off the floor as you will be craving more. And more we will get next year as Avengers 4 will be released.

I highly recommend this film to all sci-fi, comic book movie, comedy and action fans out there. This highly lives up to the hype and deserves its spot as the #1 top grossing film of all time.",10
Best movie!!,27 April 2018,"This movie will make you cry, laugh, and smile!! Literally every emotion you have, this movie will make you feel It; it is that good!!",10
This is more like it,15 May 2018,"After the debacle that was Black Panther, I was reluctant to be excited about this. Happily, I was proved wrong.

Firstly, I know a lot people don't like the amount of humour in the MCU films. I personally enjoy it and the comedic moments in Infinity War are on the money. It seems a shame to waste the laughs that these actors can deliver and the jokes hit the mark. Pratt, Bautista and Hemsworth in particular are great.

Secondly, I enjoyed the narrative... mostly. Yes, sometimes it's messy and unexplained. Yes, sometimes it requires a good working knowledge of the MCU and leaves you reaching into the depths of your brain to work out how bits link in to the bigger picture. But mostly it's fine and I'm ok with that.

Thirdly, kudos to the visual effects team. The action sequences are stunning and keep you gripped from start to finish. Seriously, give these guys some medals and awards.

One negative: some of the characters feel underused. Obviously I'm not surprised by this as there was most of Hollywood in it but I still felt some of them weren't explored as much as they could have been.

Lastly, can we all take a moment to appreciate Josh Brolin? Considering his real face is never seen, he delivers the best performance out of all of them. Yeah, his character isn't brilliantly written but he gives it everything despite this.

This is a great movie, relatively speaking. It's not going to win an Oscar. It's not going to go down as a classic. But, for what it is in the grand scheme of things, it's fantastic.",9
It is not very nice,27 April 2018,,8
Infinity War is a non-stop adrenalin gush throughout its entirety,12 May 2018,"The movie delivers overwhelmingly and worthy for every buck spent. A triumphant blockbuster from the MCU sure to break(ing) and set(ting) new trends & records. It is packed with an intense and intricate narrative that wastes no time building its momentum and connects all the 18 movie threads coherently while solving minor plotholes of each film, suffered individually so far. Particularly applaudable and respected is the writing to embed such a huge lot of characters by Christopher Markus & Stephen McFeely and the gripping direction by the Russo brothers in creating this massive behemoth. The blissfully orchestrated music by Alan Silvestri is what keeps you hooked unconsciously. Marvel has finally learnt to justify their villains through Thanos and his villainous motives. The CGI and VFX unlike previous marvel movies have all been taken to a whole new level. Such high order ingenuity and planning in film-making is rarely observed in hollywood movies these days. Turn your heads down and you will regret missing an alluring moment. The makers left no stone unturned. Sadly the fate of few characters and the waiting required to watch the untitled Avengers film next year is unfortunate because of the shocking surprises. Hope Ant-Man and the Wasp & Captain Marvel give us a peek into what's coming next. 10 Years of creative efforts ultimately paid off from MCU & Kevin Fiege. James Cameron feels there is an avengers fatigue incoming, and it has been appropriately answered through this one that MCU will never take you there. It is one super-hero movie that has to win many awards in the next year oscars!",10
Nice CGIs but story ahhh,9 May 2018,,7
Avengers: Infinity War Truly Delivers On Its Ten Year Buildup,15 May 2018,"I wasn't a Marvel fan until I watched The Avengers in 2012. I had seen tidbits of Iron Man and Iron Man 2, I had watched Thor in the movie theaters, and I hadn't seen Captain America: The First Avenger but these films, while they were enjoyable to a certain extent, didn't make me incredibly happy. The Avengers did. At that time there had never been a superhero ensemble like it before and it was positively incredible. Jump forward six years later and Avengers: Infinity War has completely wowed me like The Avengers once did.

This movie isn't just spectacular because it's got nearly two dozen heroes in it but because Thanos was the villain worth waiting for. He arrives, gets an Infinity Gauntlet sized grip on your emotions and your fears for the heroes, and doesn't let go until the end of the movie. I walked away from this film completely stunned and I mean that in the best way possible. Marvel has created a superhero film that's going to be extremely hard to replicate in any way, shape, or form in the future for other superhero flicks and I just couldn't be happier with the experience I had.

Now I watched this film twice and the only reason why I don't have it as a solid 10 out of 10 is because the movie is VERY long. When you watch the film the first time the story is so compelling you don't even notice the two hour and thirty-two minute run time but after the second time I watched it felt like I had seen a really epic superhero marathon. That doesn't make the movie bad. It just isn't a movie I can rewatch over and over again like some of the other Marvel films (Black Panther, Guardians of the Galaxy, Thor: Ragnarok) and that is it its only fault. It's definitely one of my favorite superhero movies of all time though and I highly recommend you see it before it leaves theaters.",10
Great fights but a dissapointing engagement,19 December 2018,Avengers Infinity War id the 3rd movie in the series and is surprisingly better than the first two. Although that does not make this a spectacular movie. The fight scenes are great and the actors are top of the notch but this movie does not engage it's audience. Avengers 3 is a movie to watch but does not match the other top movies of the year.,7

"If I could give it 11 stars, I would",15 May 2018,"This one was for the true fans. I can relate to those who have no real vested interest in these characters. It's a long, confusing, space war movie with cool special effects. But to the true fans who knew almost exactly what to expect, or knew what or whom they were seeing; this film is a modern masterpiece. The magnum opus of the MCU. What other superhero movie in a universe known to be free of consequence could invoke such a broad dynamic of emotion? I am a grown man, jaded to most things in this world, and I shed more tears for this film than any other. I also loved the humor. There were times when I couldn't help but belt out a hearty HA much to my embarrassment. But at times I could hear a symphony of noses sniffling behind me. This one may be hard for young children, but that doesn't mean they shouldn't see it. I saw it standard, but now I know that I need to see this in IMAX before the opportunity is lost forever. If I could give it 11 stars, I would. Don't wear makeup to this one.",10

Infinity War is the quintessential,19 January 2022,,6
SPOILER FREE REVIEW,26 April 2018,"Hello there , after seeing Avengers Infinity War this morning I felt I had to share a fraction of my enthusiasm for this movie. It's a rare thing indeed that a movie lives up to its hype , how often have you went to the cinema only to discover that the best parts are all in the trailer ? Well, fear not , because this is the best Marvel movie so far. The first 5 minutes are awesome and hooks you straight away but hang on because this is truly a roller coaster ride that just speeds up from this point. Whilst some people might worry that at 2 hours 20 , this may be a bum-numbing experience , but rest assured , this movie flies over all too fast and leaves you wanting more . One major advantage this super hero film has over the rest is the main villain, Thanos. This is the first time I can actually remember a murderous tyrant having a rational reason for destroying half a galaxy and Josh Brolin's performance is nothing short of incredible. Seriously , go see this movie NOW before someone reveals the many great scenes or plot twists - YOU WONT BE DISSAPOINTED !!!!!.",10
No!! What?? Nothing matches the expectation.,28 April 2018,"Ok. Let's talk about most awaited movie. Infinity war. As per my and my 8 friends opinion(who watched movie with me) this is the worst movie in Avengers franchise.

What is plus point: Good fight scene. Some goose bumps moments. And you know cross-over.

What is minus point: **Movie is half, i don't want to spoil but movie is officially half. Movie ends in the middle of the scene. You will finish this movie with real confusion like what just happened and what will happen. **Comedy is not good. As compared to Avengers 1 and 2 movie, comedy is just time pass. **There are so many superheroes in the movie, but no one fights with his potential. (I know Thanos is the most powerful villain in MCU as well as in comics.) Wanda Maximoff's fight scene is unexpectedly good. Iron man and Captain America are as expected. Rest all superheroes don't match your expectation in fighting scenes. Some are extremely miserable. **And the last, if you have watched trailer, atleast 20% of the scenes are missing in the movie. There is no possibility of such scenes.

Conclusion: Watch it, but without expectation. Or wait for next Movie(May ,2019) and watch it togather.",7
"Not even an average 5, no way 8+",1 November 2018,"Avengers: Infinity War getting anything above a 6 ratings destroys my faith in IMDB's rating system. Once I got past the first page of 10/10 ratings, the rest were 1, 2 and a few miscellaneous 5's. Four of us sat down to watch this movie last night and only two of us could finish it. I apologized for renting it and threw IMDB's ratings system under the bus. I kept waiting for something redeeming to happen, but it never did. The countless times I said, ""Well, that was stupid"" went on through the entire movie. Plot holes, lazy writing or whatever you want to call it were just constant. I will not wait through another 2+ hour movie in this series hoping for something redeeming to happen. Oh, and taking the red, white and blue away from Captain Am.., wait, what's his name again? Steve somebody. No, I'm done and whatever gaming of the IMDB ratings went on makes it of less use too.",1
The most entertaining superhero movie in years!,1 May 2018,"First, I don't like MCU/DC or any superhero movies, I just watch them for free to waste time. But this movie is one of the boldest movies ever without mercy or holding back. Brutal ending and I loved it!

The story - I dont wanna waste brain cells to understand why people asking for a story when you have 100 super hero movies leading up to this movie which is ALL OUT WAR. They fight all the time, its WAR not DRAMA. Understand the genres!

Characters - No need for introduction. Each character has its own movie. Go watch them.

CGI - mind blowing.

Humor - for the very first time there is a good humor and in right place in superhero movie. I had few good laughs.

For last - finally they are going to chill on this genre (hopefully) and we can get other blockbusters in genres crushing the cinemas, cause I'm sick of this genre.",8
another great film,1 August 2018,As I do all the Marvel films constantly look out for Stan Lee and he arrives pretty quickly in this one.Had to admit had a little chuckle at my over enthusiasm at looking out for Mr lee.But there you go my review of this film is from my initial will it won't it be good or great after my last foray into the marvel universe left me feeling a little less than thrilled with Avengers Age Of Ultron and it being one that I wanted to finish as needed to see it through to the end in a desperate desire that it may get better toward the end but unfortunently it didn't. Infinity War however was absolutely the opposite holding my curiosity from start to finish. Incorporating a entire cornucopia of Marvel characters and holding you on the edge of your seat until the end. If as I started I was metamorphasised into the aforementioned mentioned Mr Lee I would be more than happy with this showpiece of the fantastic realm that is Marvel.,9
An ending... or a beginning?,30 April 2018,"Let's, for the sake of simplicity, divide it into theme-based and character-based points:

1- The movie starts out strong. Very strong, in fact, for a movie with a very important mission statement: To tie up all the previous Marvel Cinematic Universe movies (excluding F4 and X-Men) and deliver a fitting conclusion (or semi-conclusion?).

2- For a movie that has such a great number of heroes and heroines, the movie does a fairly good job of distributing screen time between each of them. Of course, some characters get a bigger share of screen time, but this is to be expected, of course, since those characters are the ones who have their own individual movies.

3- There are some great jokes in the movie which made me chuckle despite my best efforts not to do so, and also some misplaced ones which made me question if such a character would make such a joke in such a dire circumstance.

4- Despite the fact that the last half hour of the movie (if not more) is pure action, the dramatic elements in the movie are particularly strong and this somewhat means a deviation from the formula of Marvel's most recent movies.

5- The antagonist of the movie seems to have been crafted masterfully. The inner-workings of the character makes the villain almost ""not-a-villain"", who, in other similar movies, would only pursue a goal of domination only for the sake of it. The way Thanos's mind works is, to the best of my knowledge, in line with the comics, which makes the story even more relate-able, and the character believable.

6- The ending does deliver a huge blow to the audience (in so many aspects, if I may add so), and makes us wonder what may or will follow up after this particular block-buster. (Deadpool 2 doesn't count. Sorry.)

7- The post-credits scene is utterly meaningless, especially after such a huge ending, and does not leave us wanting.

8- Last, but not least, the music, the cgi, the multiple environments in the movie are all masterfully done, and it makes you wonder, what next?

All in all, this is a movie which would deservedly get a 9/10, not just from me, but from a whole lot of people out there. Still, in my humble opinion, Winter Soldier -as a story well told- is and will always be one level above this one. However, the themes and the stories of these two tend to occupy two different places in the space-time continuum, if I were to be completely honest.",9
Avengers: Vanishers,9 June 2018,,8
people who rate it under 5 stars are just haters and jealous!,29 May 2018,"This movie is better / as good as the previous MCU movies. at the time of my reivew the average of 300,000 reviews is 8.8 which is crazy! who would rate it 1 or 2 start? XD haters and jealous people who can follow the storyline or not interested at all!",9
An Honest Review (NO SPOILERS)- Spectacular or Probably the Greatest for MCU audience but simultaneously WEIRD for Non-MCU ones,28 April 2018,"If you are following MCU since its inception, I bet you will rate it above every MCU film as it was so-fast paced that your 100% focus is needed throughout the movie. I thoroughly enjoyed it and there was not a single low point throughout the movie, unlike any other MCU film. Obviously I've watched every MCU movie till date so I was well-addressed with the ongoing events.

I absolutely loved Black Panther and Thor Ragnarok and they easily break into Top-6 Avengers films ever but they also had some plot draggers but Infinity War didn't. It will leave you stunned from start to the end.

For People who weren't aware of MCU, I STRONGLY recommend to not SPOIL it before watch these movies. (A brief list who had link with the Infinity War, not the whole set)

(MUST) Iron Man 1 (2008) (OPTIONAL) Iron Man 2 (2010) (MUST) Thor 1 (2011) (MUST) Captain America 1 (2011) (MUST) The Avengers (2012) (Optional) Captain America: Winter Soldier (2014) (MUST) Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) (MUST) Avengers: Age of Ultron (MUST) Captain America: Civil War (MUST) Doctor Strange (MUST) Thor: Ragnarok (MUST) Black Panther

SKIP The Incredible Hulk Iron Man 3 Thor: The Dark World (Only Post Credit is Relevant)(Go for the written plot instead) Ant-Man Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 Spider-Man: Homecoming (Ending is Relevant)

Even though I strongly recommend you to finish all 18 MCU movies but you can save at least 14 hrs by skipping the latter list to ensure you are fully prepared for The Infinity War.",9
A miracle that it works at all,26 November 2019,"With so many characters, the Russo brothers made an intelligent choice to center the emotional core of the film within a new character and the only one large enough within the narrative space to justify it: the antagonist. Outside of him, the movie's essentially the biggest episode of a serial ever. It does that quite well, but it ends up squeezing out Thanos a bit. He's good and enough to anchor a movie around, but everything else around him is pure spectacle and little else.

I say little else because all of our heroes get their moments. Thor talking about everything he's lost. Vision and Scarlet Witch's little romance taking shape. Peter Quill's grief at the loss of a loved one. It's all there, but it almost all depends on things outside this movie to work. Not that anyone would ever come into this movie without having at least some knowledge of the myriad of franchises that precedes it, but I think it deadens the impact of the moments since the emotional workload isn't held within this movie itself. This isn't like the final moments of a three-part movie like The Lord of the Rings, this is the culmination of more than twenty films, each with their own adventures and main characters, that end up tying together here.

So what you do have is a well-produced series of epic fights and events in the vein of a man on a mission type story, peppered with small character moments, revolving around the character of Thanos.

Thanos is the biggest threat the Avengers have faced (other than Dormmamu who was going to wipe out the entire universe in Doctor Strange, I guess), and he's one of the better antagonists. I don't think he's miles better than Hela, Loki, or Vulture, but he's definitely in that league. He's a titan driven by an ideal, and he's pure psychopath. Some people put forward the idea that Thanos could use the power of the Infinity Stones to double the universe's resources, but that misses the point of the character. He's a Malthusian through and through. He sees intelligent life as a cancer, infecting the universe, and that's what must be wiped out. He's so psychotic that to even dream of reasoning with him is asinine. He's committed, and he demonstrate that commitment to his vision by sacrificing his beloved adopted daughter to gain one of the stones (the Soul Stone).

Meanwhile, our heroes take on several different related goals. There's the attempt to remove and destroy the Mind Stone from Vision's forehead. There's Thor trying to replace Mjolnir. There's Iron Man leading Dr. Strange and Spider-Man (joined by most of the Guardians of the Galaxy) to fight Thanos before he gains full strength on the titan's destroyed home planet. The story is structured around these different tasks, each told with the Marvel brand of quippy humor, seasoned with just enough emotion borrowed from the franchise's history, and built to all crescendo at the same time.

That crescendo, which really takes up the last hour or so of the film, is something to admire. There are so many pieces moving and so many parts flying in so many different locations that the fact that it's easy to understand who is involved in what and why on a consistent basis is kind of remarkable. The Russo Brothers have evolved a lot in terms of action cinematography since The Winter Soldier. They still have a preference for shallow depth of field, handheld camera, and close up photography, but they edit it a bit less frantically and pull back more than enough to firmly establish geography.

One thing they haven't really grown on, though, is visuals in general. It's an interesting contrast to watch so many of these movies in a row. Just a few movies back was Guardians of the Galaxy: Vol. 2. In it, everything with brightly colored with array of beautiful things. When Thor shows up in the Guardian's ship, the same location that was so easily bathed in color in the previous movie has been dialed back to almost complete darkness. The movie as a whole isn't dark (the fight in Wakanda is very brightly lit), but it's fascinating to see some of the same locations and costumes that had been so colorful drained of it all in this. I think it's an incorrect visual choice for the franchise, especially as it embraces its cosmic side. It needs to be crazier visually instead of dark and ""grounded"".

Still, I find Thanos a good villain, the ride overall fun and engaging, and just wish that it didn't rely so much on the previous movies and looked brighter and more colorful. For a movie that I could not see as being anything other than an expensive mess, that's quite an accomplishment.",7
Infincible?,27 April 2018,"The event is finally here, and boy does it have big expectations to live up to as the culmination of ten years of movies comes rushing in. With perhaps one of the biggest expectations to meet, can Avengers: Infinity War meet everything we die-hard fans love, or does the over expectation syndrome come into play. Robbie K with a spoiler free review coming at you to shed some light on the subject.

Movie: Marvel: Avengers Infinity War Directors: Anthony Russo, Joe Russo Writers: Christopher Markus (screenplay by), Stephen McFeely Stars: Robert Downey Jr., Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo

LIKES:

Character Development: It's always nice to see character evolve and while the 18 installments before this movie have laid strong foundations, Infinity continues that trend. Not everyone gets the full red-carpet treatment (with all the characters at hand), but those that do have some deeper trenches we did not expect. You'll certainly feel things resonate if you've been following the story so far and a fantastic means to tie you into the story.

Story Twists: We all have theories about this movie, most centered on who would survive the war for the Infinity Stones. Despite everything foreshadowed in the trailers, you have no idea what is coming. Infinity Wars is a universe filled with twists, throwing in suspenseful moments with ease and doing everything to keep you on the edge of your seat. The trailers were certainly edited to leave out key details, and that mystery was very well appreciated as the revelations began to drop and the story began to click, up until the very end. Be ready for some answers to lingering questions you may not have realized you have, and some surprises that will have you cheering in delight and excitement.

Acting: A small quality to comment on, and way too many actors to hit up in detail, the acting still lives up to the potential we had set up. All the contenders easily reprise their roles, bringing delight, fun, heroism and heart wrenching moments to life with no hesitation. Mixing the team together, really did feel like an awkward, weird family trying to save the galaxy one minute at a time. Despite all the characters crammed into this mega hit, the chemistry works fantastically.

Comedy: Marvel's writing continues to lean towards the comedic stick, trying to garnish the comic plots in a more expansive way to net more audience members in the box office. Infinity War has plenty of moments mashed into the space epic adventure, a mixture of slapstick, insults, well-timed cursing, and comical references that keep the giggles, guffaws, and laughter coming. Don't worry of the darker atmosphere overshadowing the laughs, there will be plenty to try and keep things as bright as possible.

Action, somewhat: The special effects are hands down impressive, especially seeing the stones powers better utilized than just exploding like previous films. All the sound editing and CGI are worthy of the theater spectacle, perhaps the biggest reason to come see in the theater. Infinity War has some decent brawls that deliver the fist pumping, adrenaline rush you wanted to see as new tricks are unleashed and styles mix together. Especially near the end, there is one particular fight that feels much like an epic video game battle with all the bells and whistles ringing into one. A little eccentric at times, but hey it is a comic book movie.

DISLIKES:

Lulls in Action: While there is good storytelling in this movie, an Avengers movie is known more for the fast pace and battles. There are some major lulls in the action, as the three-story trails attempt to connect all the pieces in the quest for uncovering the stones. These gaps are by far entertaining, but at times I felt another battle needed to be integrated, or others extended to keep the pace going. I liked the emotional warfare in this movie, but come on, a little more resistance.

The Black Order: This is only a semi-dislike, but Thanos elite guards were not as ""elite"" as I had expected. Gross and creepy looking, definitely. Deadly and threatening in design? Absolutely. But in regards to their skills, these masters of destruction were kind of... weak and under developed. It doesn't mean they don't get their 15 minutes to shine, but let's just say these characters really needed more integration in the story for this reviewer to enjoy.

Too Many Characters?: So many people mixed into one movie, brings with it the threat of potentially denying your favorite character the time you want him/her to hold. It happens in this movie, so take what you can get and run with it as best as you can. They do a nice job with most of them, but three of the characters got a bit stiff armed that I wasn't expecting to see. So, this element could have been tweaked to get a better immersive story in my opinion.

The Ending: I can't say much about this, but the ending to Infinity War is almost as mixed as the characters in this galactic quest. There will be many questions generated from it and even more theories as to how the next wave will proceed, which I guess is good to keep interest coming. However, it kind of felt cheaply delivered and rushed over, in a manner that was sort of a cop out to be honest. Based on that last sentence, this component is why the ending was not as well-received, not for the questions it generated.

The Fight at Wakanda: The biggest selling point of the trailers was that war on the Wakandan plains, where Wakanda soldiers join the elite squad to fight thousands of CGI aliens. With all the storytelling elements building up to the climax, I had very high hopes this battle was going to be the climactic piece to bring it all together. I'll admit, there are some parts that are true creative genius, but much of the battle was glazed over, dull, and missing so much of the battle chemistry I had expected. Quick finishes to semi-suspenseful moments, and much shorter than I anticipated, this battle was certainly the element I was most disappointed with.

The VERDICT:

Infinity Wars didn't quite live up to the hype that the marketing brought with it, but this does not mean it was a bad movie. A very edgy tale awaits the theaters, with twists and character development waiting to evolve our characters to the next level, with a few flashy battles to liven things up and comedy to ease the tension. Yet, this project may have been a little too big to tackle, leading to many things being glazed over in trade for others. Try to lower your expectations and I think you will be okay, just try to accept that there will be answers to come, one just has to wait.

My scores are:

SPELLBOUND !!!,30 April 2018,"Being a Marvel fan myself, i was expecting a kind of Avengers movie which would literally blow my mind ( After all the Hype & taking in account the previous MCU movies). As expected, Marvel delivered yet another masterpiece. This movie will surprise even those who are not new fans of Marvel. The plot is executed exceptionally well. The costumes, certain dialogues & some occasional humour ( Yes, you read it right. Surprised, aren't you? ) they are all just FANTASTIC. Each and every character has its own role to play ( Except Peter Quill AKA Star Lord . Just Kidding) be it small or large. So many characters, still you never seem to forget any of those as they are all AWESOME in their own way (of course not as cool as Iron Man or Doctor Strange or Thor). A big thanks to the directors (The Russo Brothers), who did their absolute best in satisfying their fans (& not giving even a slightest of hint about anything in the movie during all the promotions). Guys, do watch it even if you are not a Marvel fan. The movie will not cease to surprise you time and again.",10

Why Do We Go to the Movies?,21 January 2019,"I don't know about you, but more often than not, I watch movies or TV shows to escape for a while. I grew up as a keen movie fan and this has continued into adulthood. I've enjoyed all the Marvel Universe movies to date, some more than others. Winter Soldier was a highlight, Civil War was great, but when I heard they were going to bring it all together, I must admit I thought it was going to be a bit messy - still enjoyable - but messy. I am happy to report that I was wrong. THIS is what I want from a night at the cinema! Bags of action, snappy dialogue, incredible special effects and most importantly, surprisingly ...heart. Every hero gets their moment and not in a rushed or crammed in manner. The set pieces are astonishing, the laughs fast and plentiful. Brolin is the best villain in The MCU to date, managing to be both hateful and sympathetic, sometimes in the same scene! As the fella once said, ""I may not know art but I know what I like"", well this will never win an Oscar for Best Picture, but I would rather watch this than La La Land or Moonshine any day of the week. I can't wait to see where they take this next. Bravo Marvel, bravo.",10
"Visual pleasure as usual, and incredible ensemble cast",11 July 2018,"A very successful blockbuster, which I can say is the one I enjoy the most in all the movies I have watched this year in cinema.

I appreciate the visual pleasure it distributes through the abundant scenes with special effects as a typical Marvel movie, for which I suggest audiences to watch it in cinema for the best enjoyment. Also I'm really impressed by how they managed to put all the Marvel characters into this one movie without any pointless or boring plots.

However, it is inevitable that some dialogues and plots to introduce the other characters from a different story to connect to the original ones of Avengers series can make the narrative less compact and focused, but it is not a big influence overall. Moreover, to make up the distraction or confusion due to the added characters, I think they make good use of some of them like Grout from Guardians of the Galaxy.

This is a movie Marvel fan shouldn't miss for sure.",9
AMAZING!,17 October 2018,AMAZING! Grear characters with great story! Was never bored when I watched this opening day!,10
"Fantastic Job, MARVEL STUDIOS!!!",30 October 2018,"This movie is amazing. By being the first half of a 2-parter which concludes the first 3 phases in the MCU, it could not have been better. The makers of this film are summing up 23 movies with these last 2 Avengers films beautifully. Rounding out the entire story arc with careful writing and doing every character his or her due justice. I applaud the Russo brothers for this achievement 110%, since it is most definitely not an easy task.

The character who we have all been teased about ""coming to reek major havoc"" on our beloved super hero A-Team, The Avengers, and their new found friends, The Guardians of the Galaxy, is all and more I had hoped he would be. Thanos is a whole lot more dimensional in the MCU than in the comics, that is for sure. He has a deep meaning for his reasoning. He does horrible things, yes, but for, in his mind, a positive reason. And Josh Brolin does an excellent job in making Thanos believable.

The pace of this movie is the most amazing thing about it. This is about a 2 1/2 hour movie, but it seems to fly by because every scene is jam packed with either fun character interactions, awesome action, or storyline importance. My eyes were glued to the screen in fascination.

The ending was one of the most daring endings ever seen on film. I can not wait for Avengers 4.

INCREDIBLE CINEMATIC EVENT,3 January 2019,"After 5th time to seeing this movie, Im writing this review. Infinity War is not just a movie. It is a consequence of events in Marvel movies for 10 years. It is a huge responsibility to make a movie like this. Because it has to be a bridge of phase 3 and 4, considering MCU will be continued for years... Also this is a big comic book event and it has lots of characters. Russo Brothers and writers did a brilliant job on it. It is amazingly epic, it has action all the time, it might make you cry few times, it can make you extremely laugh, it makes you thrilled and surprised. Shortly, you feel a lot of emotions during Infinity War. Even if you didnt watch any marvel movie, it can blow your mind too. No doubt, it is absolutely one of the greatest comic book movies in history. Im counting days for Endgame.",9
"This is a Thanos movie, not an Avengers movie. Boldest MCU Film to date!",26 April 2018,,9

"Brave and bold, not without its flaws though.",26 April 2018,"I think this film is brilliantly executed, with many gasp, cheer and laugh moments. How it's truly viewed will be after the next film comes out to see if that ending was worth it.",9
"Infinity War is the biggest, baddest, boldest superhero film in a long time. Thank Thanos.",27 April 2018,"With a never ending horde of superhero characters, you could call this the biggest superhero ensemble in Marvel's Cinematic Universe. Heck, even without the searing white excitement generated by all the hype, this was going to be the superhero event of the year. Anyway you look at it, Avengers: Infinity War is the biggest, baddest, boldest superhero film in a long time.

And it's a long time coming with 19 preceding films in three phases over the last 10 years - it was all coming down to this. Viewers who stayed back for the post credits scene during those films (now a Marvel gold standard), were already in on it, and will be the most rewarded during this film. Although the plotline is simple, old and tired - ala save the world from an intergalactic despot - the mythology behind the story and how it is penned for the screen is by the far the best part about this film, and perhaps one of the best from the MCU. Equally praise worthy is the writing and rendition of Thanos, who is not only the best villain in the franchise but somehow the central character too. What makes Thanos even more lovable (as a villain you love to hate to love) is his human-like flaws despite his colossal repute as the most destructive and feared force in the universe. Even better is the fact that amongst the entire star cast (count at least 25 top name appearances) Thanos, voiced by Josh Brolin, is entirely CGI rendered yet still remains at the forefront of this film. In some ways, and despite the atrocities committed by Thanos, you still find a soft corner and empathetically sound reasons to believe why he does what he does. Now this is the modus operandi of a true villain and not even the avengers and Guardians of the Galaxy teamed together can stop him.

Despite the expected humour throughout the film, those atrocities make Avengers: Infinity War the darkest film in the MCU. This means viewers and fans will have to brace themselves for quite a few unexpected turns in the story, some of which may seem straight out of a Greek tragedy. That is the nature of this film, and at times irresistibly devastating. However prepared you think you are, and no matter what you've heard before going to watch this film, Avengers: Infinity War is always two steps ahead. Just like Thanos. I can hardly wait to see his reincarnation as Cable.",8
You can skip this one,9 August 2018,"I am not a fan. But I do like a lot of special effects and I do like to have fun while watching this kind of movies. However, you can easily skip this one. It is the worst part in the MCU series. People giving more the 5 stars just for the special effects? C'mon. This not how it is supposed to work.",1
Quintessence of «Marvel Cinematic Universe»,9 May 2018,This is the movie we were waiting for 10 years. TEN YEARS CARL! Ten years of work lead to this very moment. Truly historic event. I am very happy to live in this time and see such an amazing things happen on our planet. This is the movie when you come out of the theatre stunned by WOW-effect. I'm sure this movie would hit 2bln. $.,10

Definitely the BEST Avengers movie to date ! 10/10,3 May 2018,"This is a truly eye opener avenger movie that i ever seen. All other marvel movie NOT even close to it. 1 thing i would like to point out, IRON MAN Technology has gone up insanely. I am super shocked ! As for the bad guy Thanos, well it did bring me some sadness and of course his super power ! Hey, even our big guy green man CANNOT find thanos ! Well the only sad part is, some of the heroes are gone......SIGH..... Well not going to mention who are the heroes. Looking foward 2019 part 2. Well worth movie ticket money !!",10
The highlight of the MCU,10 June 2018,"So this is what the whole previous 18 MCU movies were working towards? WORTH IT. This movie was dark, funny, and just pure awesome. The opening scene will put a chill down your spine, and it's only when this scene is over do you truely understand what your watching. It has a great mix of humour to make this movie not too dark, but a perfect amount which DC may be lacking. And once the movie is over, you will walk out of the cinema wondering ""what did I just watch..."" this is truly is a masterpiece that will be remembered for years to come, nothing can top this.",9
Broke all records for a reason,9 May 2018,"This movie had me speechless, emotional and aching for the next one. In all of my 20 years I have never seen such a great movie. It had EVERYHING (and everyone) you'd want in a movie. I had very very VERY high expectations about Infinity War and I can say that my expectations were blown away. It was so much better than I could've ever even imagined. Recommend.",10
nonsense reviews..,23 September 2018,"Only registered to point this out because it's got beyond a joke. The reviews can't be trusted.. Before ""Black Panther"" hit theaters, alt-right Facebook group ""Down With Disney's Treatment of Franchises and its Fanboys"" announced plans to sabotage the ""Black Panther"" audience score (the same group previously took responsibility for targeting ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi"" with negative scores). The group reportedly created a Facebook event called ""Give Black Panther a Rotten Audience Score on Rotten Tomatoes"".

Seriously. What a joke the reviews have become and a waste of anyone's time to read. I think IMDb has a problem with its own ""User Score,"" which allows registered users to rate a film on its scale of 1 to 10 stars only after the film has been released or screened at least once. However, most users don't write a review; they tick off a star rating and move on which i believe the most accurate reviews.. avoid the comments at all cost!",9
The best of the Avengers so far,2 January 2019,"As the greatest threat the universe has ever seen seeks the six stones which allows him to decimate any living creature, the disassembled Avengers must do whatever they can, even if that means making the toughest sacrifices, in order to prevent Thanos from achieving his goal.

This third installment in the Avengers franchise brings a different approach to the series. It gathers its very popular characters/superheroes and puts them in a situation they've never faced before. Threatened from multiple places and also working on multiple plans, their actions are now bound to bring drama, rather than joy. Thus, the much darker atmosphere this movie generates is a very welcome change at least from my point of view. We still get the awesome scenery and the deeply satisfying action sequences, but the drama which they tend to generate has a much bigger impact. We also get some laughs seldomly and even some interesting sarcasm which are a good addition to the film, but those are somehow expected from a Marvel movie.

As you might have guessed by now, the plot represents the movie's greatest aspect. The way it unfolds and the way it generates such emotion is unique, thus you have to give it credit for that. The characters are very well known from the other Marvel movies so there isn't much to say about them, besides the fact that they keep their characteristics, both good and bad, and that they are very well played by their impressive and charismatic actors. It's needless to say that this movie's cast can easily impress anyone without even mentioning the title or the plot.

The visual part is top-notch. You get such great CGI that you're eyes simply cannot believe what they are seeing. Everything is so well thought and implemented that you cannot avoid saying ""wow"" at least a couple of times. We tend to get accustomed with CGI and special effects these days, but the ones features here are simply extraordinary.

In conclusion, it's so far the best movie which ""wears"" the Avengers name, bringing a new approach to the franchise while leaving plenty of room for a highly expected sequel thanks to its unpredictable but also very profound finale. It managed to impress in every single way so I give it full credit for that.",10

The best MCU movie out there,30 April 2018,"It is the best MCU movie in my opinion, it is refreshing, emotional and has a really great villain. It is a wonderful experience",10
Best villan,4 May 2018,"If I would have chance t vote twice I would vote for thanos character, Strong appearance even he's quite.. Don't talk much, if he do so, straight to the point.. Emotional but strong physically and mentally.. He knows what he's doing..

Love that kind of characters . I assume thanks would be same in next part..",10
Amazing.,6 May 2018,"If you're not a fan of this universe of if you haven't seen the other movies, you're probably not going to like it. There isn't a whole lot of character development because all these characters have already been developed and established in other movies. If you haven't seen the other movies before watching this one, then you're probably going to be a bit confused concerning everyone's motivations. Except for Thanos. This is basically his movie. Thanos is a giant middle finger to everyone who says that supervillians can't be good as he is probably one of the best villains that I've ever seen.

Though this movie may be long, it is extremely fast-paced. The graphics are all incredible (though there are a few minor shots that probably aren't going to hold up well). This movie keeps you watching with all the different well-executed subplots. Though the script could've been a bit better at times, the action is phenomenal. The boundaries between reality and imagination are tested by the powers of characters such as Thanos and Doctor Strange.

I could go on and on for hours about how much this movie does well, but instead I'm just gonna describe my theater experience.

This was probably one of the worst audiences that I've ever watched a movie with yet. Whenever there was any kind of joke, the audience laughed so hard I couldn't hear the next lines. Well, I say ""any kind of joke"" but whenever there was a couple of lines that were genuinely clever and funny I was one of the only people who reacted. At one point Thor appeared onscreen (it was the bit when he ex machinas his way into Wakanda) and some guy stood up and started clapping and cheering ""WHOOO THOOOOOOOR"" and it was pretty annoying. Also there was a lot of other slightly less loud reactions to other events.

After the end-credits scene everyone left the theater pissed off. This movie does have multiple character deaths and legitimate consequences as opposed to most Marvel movies. Its kind of sad that negative audience reactions to things like that encourage studios to avoid risks in the future. Unlike other movies of this type, I had no clue what was going to happen because of where they took the story, and that's a good thing. I wish that less movies tried to go the route of the happy ending like this one.",10
A Masterpiece,6 May 2018,"This movie - WOW. Everything about it is amazing. After years of speculation and anticipation Marvel/Disney truly delivered on their promises. I'm not going to spoil anything for those that haven't seen it yet, but I will say that this is the best Marvel movie to date.

The combination of the Avengers, the Guardians, and all the other heroes and supporting characters from each of the 18 movies leading up to this is a feat in itself. All the characters have remained true to their past versions, and the proper introduction to Thanos was that indeed - proper.

I have been a marvel fan my entire life, so when I read reviews from casual viewers who were disappointed or had trouble believing how Thanos can do things/overpower characters they are used to seeing (yes there are many bad reviews), all I have to say is they know nothing. In the comics Thanos is an unbelievably powerful character, so my advice to the casual viewer who doesn't know much about these characters is to get informed. If you know what you are walking into you will be extremely impressed with what you see. It's not just the power perspective of Thanos, but also the emotional aspect of his nihilistic ways that can somewhat be understandable and allow to you see things from his perspective (in no way condoning his decisions).

As for the movie it contains many moments of laughter, great action sequences, and for those with any knowledge of the comics some powerful, emotionally charged scenes.

This movie is now my favorite Marvel movie, which was previously either Guardians of the Galaxy or Captain America Civil War. I left the movie in awe and can't wait to see it again, and a whole year until the sequel is going to feel like a lifetime.

Oh, and see it in IMAX if you can, it was specifically shot with an IMAX lens and it is well worth it.",10
worse then ironman 2,3 May 2018,You know you can wrap a a pile of poo in pretty paper and bow but still a pile of poo and thats what this movie is sooooo disapointed,1
Simpley amazing,26 April 2018,"This movie is pure perfection , the plot the action the effects the scenery are all amazing ! You cant find a single boring moment in the entire movie , the timing is what impressed me the most , with so many charactees they have managed to give them all enough screen time to satisfy every veiwer also thanos just dominated that villain curse of marvel movies.",10
The Infinite Outcome of 10 years of MCU,3 May 2018,"Infinity War! The massive outcome of 10 years! Worth it? Absolutely yes. Thanos, the progression of the story, technical details etc. Well done, Russo bros. (and of course our remarkable Avengers<3) The only part I complain about is that Wakanda-Battle. How come the glorious Wakanda Army don't have a cannon or something can be called as 'big gun'? That part was really disappointing. I loved the movie and give 8/10 (but i'm afraid of DC fans so I decided, giving 9 on IMDb is a better idea)",8

That means my rating is not quite relevant because i can't get rid of a feeling Infinity War is just a half of the movie. But i must admit it's a damn good half. And now the long waiting starts.",10
Good movie,17 June 2018,Its rated 8.8 they should put it in top 15 Not 20 . Marval very good company for movies,10
This movie is breathtaking for all the comic book fans.,4 May 2018,Marvel took a huge risk in making this movie and fact that it turned out this great is absolutely phenomenon. Hats off to you Marvel. Job well done for all the directors and the crew that worked on this movie.,10
Absolutely bored.,30 April 2018,"Maybe I'm just getting massive franchise fatigue but I found the moving totally borIng. The story is linear, the stakes don't seem real by foreshadowIng the fact that they can change the past, and there's a LOT of backstory they fill in to get you up to speed on all 500 marvel super hero's from their various franchises that it's hard to feel emotionally engage. The power balance between characters strength and weaknesses seemed flawed. One character would be in peril from X weapon in one scene but then beat a more powerful weapon Y in another scene. Movies attain suspension of disbelief by setting and following rules. These rules seemed sloppily applied but all in all it wasn't as bad as Venom...",1
Perfect,28 April 2018,"This movie was perfect from start to finish. Waited 10 years for this big moment between the Avengers and Thanos. Was not disappointed. Had the perfect balance between suspense, drama, and humor. Can't wait for Avengers 4 next year.",10
Yes 90% of the movie is CGI,8 August 2018,"The CGI was way too much when compared to the other Avengers titles, maybe its due to Thanos's big head, but one thing is for certain, they should've toned down the CGI on this one a bit.

I really loved the Guardians of the Galaxy movies, and one of the reasons was the comedy and the music, but over here the jokes were not funny. It looked like they were trying too much. The characters a bit boring, it would've been better if they were not part of this movie.

The movie was all over the place, with characters moving in and out of locations, Killing off characters, even the characters with super powers were using Iron Man suits. They made it as complicated as possible.",8

A Masterpiece!!!!,18 June 2018,"This is my first review at imdb and I have only one thing to say, this film is 'masterpiece'. It is beautifully shot and every moment of the film is worth remembering. It is more than just a superhero movie,it is a celebration of the wonderful ten years of Marvel Cinematic Universe. Each character shines throughout the entire Film. There were moments where I laughed and cheered, there were moments where I was deeply tensed for the characters and most important of all some unexpected moments that made me cry. My mother who is not much of a fan of superhero films enjoyed every moment of every scene. There was one particular scene almost at the end that really broke my heart and quite possibly one of the saddest scene in the entire film. Thanos is by far one of the best villains MCU ever had, he is scary, you cannot help but love and hate him at the same time. Avengers Infinity War is truly a spectacular superhero movie. The cast and crew members should be proud of themselves for the amount of effort they put into making this epic masterpiece. Cannot wait for Avengers 4!!!!!",9

Amazing!!! Best Marvel Movie!! 10/10,7 May 2018,"Avengers: Infinity War could just be the greatest marvel movie.... oh wait..... it is!! This movie is bone chilling and ground breaking. The action, characters, score, visual effects are all amazing! And Thanos, oh boy Thanos. He is the best marvel villain without a doubt. He is complex and sorta makes you emphasize with him. Josh Brolin does an amazing job adapting the character. He even cry's! And that's motion capture. The standout is Robert Downey Junior though. Best Iron Man performance. You know what, everyone is great. The ending will 100% make you cry and is breathtaking!! 10/10!!!!",10

Everything you could want in a superhero film. The baddest heroes vs the absolute baddest villain. Need I say more?? Watch it and be amazed..... This movie was a true spectacle and brought out tons of varying emotions in viewers. The theatre I went to was packed and every one in their loved it! Everyone!,10

Amazing,9 June 2018,"Avengers: Infinity War is an incredible show that should leave all fans of Marvel speechless before the work done by Joe and Anthony Russo. The film has everything to be the new benchmark of the blockbuster as it connects the visual prowess If James Cameron would like the public to get tired very quickly Super Heroes movies, it is clearly not with this kind of feature film that it risks happening . Perfectly punctuated and filled with offbeat humor and intense emotions, the feature film is one of the best Marvel with the first Avengers and The Guardians of The Galaxy. A new cardboard insured for Marvel Studios which we wait the following impatiently",9

BRILLIANT,9 March 2019,"Marvel's Fans are going to love this movie, moreover Thanos' fans. This is the story of the Great Titan, the Mad Titan, and how he get all Infinity Stones.

I'm pretty sure that Endgame is going to be way better, but this was a MASTER PIECE.",8
Avengers: Infinity War Movie Review,21 June 2018,"I just want to say what the Russo brothers have done is outstanding. Taking a film with such a crowded cast and as a result; a very crowded story. However, I don't consider that a flaw, but nevertheless a roadblock surely. I believe they have made the best movie that they or anyone else could have done. The film felt equally leveled out, giving each character is given their own individual moments to shine. Everyone brings it in the performances, not a single weak link among them. And for once Marvel seems to finally be nailing their villains. They showed it in Black Panther, and they show it here as well. But who's better Killmonger or Thanos? It all comes down to personal preference, but personally it's hard to say in that they are two completely different characters, they both strive for separate goals due to separate motivations. Killmonger's story felt sort of Shakespearean, while Thanos felt more traditional but still very compelling in its execution. Ultimately this film lets the villain be the star, but like I said before it gives the other characters moments to shine. The action is as good as any Marvel film up to this point, along with fluctuating emotions throughout. Overall, everything that Marvel has done seems to have come to fruition and really paid off. This film may leave you wondrous and speechless. For the 3 people who haven't seen this yet, what are you waiting for?",10

It was everything I wanted and more,4 June 2018,,10
An absolute joy to witness,1 June 2018,"All throughout these ten years everything has been building up to this movie, and it surely does pay off big time. The action is incredible and the characters are so well used, it gets the plot moving constantly. Thanos is fantastic as the villain, and certainly the best MCU villain ever. Definitely one of the best superhero films ever made, and a total joy to be able to see it on the big screen.",10
Great,28 April 2018,Wow it was amazing. Cannot wait for the next movie,10
A great beginning to the end,31 May 2018,"Avengers: Infinity War is in my opinion the best mavel movie to date. It is unlike any movie I have ever seen before. It hasn't got a basic 3 part storieline and it doesnt introduce any of the heroes. This movie focuses more on introducing and following the villain. You heard that right, Thanos is the lead character in this movie. It is more a Thanos movie than an Avengers movie, and that is what makes this movie as great as it is. It is not your standard superhero movie and definitly not your standard marvel movie. Finally marvel has a great villain. Also the humor is on point in this movie and the avengers are great as always. In my opinion thor is my favorite avenger in this movie and his character has the most development of all the avengers. I gave this movie a 10/10, but i have to honest and say that i am a bit of a mcu fanboy. I think that if you like marvel movies in general you won't be disapointed, but if you have never liked marvel movies than this movie won't change your mind and you should better go and see another movie. I recommend seeing the other marvel movies first before watching this one, because it can be confusing for poeple who don't know these characters.

All in all, great marvel movie with a great villain.",9
Best movie of the year,14 January 2019,What an amazing movie this has been. Looking forward to the sequel. The real snap is to DCEU,10
Spectacular and forgettable,5 August 2018,"It's impossible not to merit Infinity War, the fact that a movie could have this many characters and stay coherant is admirable, and the effects and actors are phenominal throughout - I truly believed I was seeing these heroes fight in these otherworldy locations.

The best parts of the movie are when the characters are just talking to each other - the wit and the charm still shines through in a movie this jam packed.

On the other hand, the action is forgettable and boring, and basically pointless. There's no tension - you as an audience member know that the avengers aren't going to defeat thanos in a fight, so why is so much of the run time devoted to character after character punch him? The final battle is the typical avengers noise fest where you know none of the characters are in danger and nothing of note is going to happen.

As a result, Infinity War fails to get me invested or interested, there's no emotional core to the movie so everything is just noise. The ending is predictable, what will happen in the hopefully better and more focused next movie is predictable, objectively you have to give the movie credit for managing to stay coherant but in the end most of it fell flat to me.

Packed with boring action, writing shortcuts, inconsistencies, emotional moments that fall flat because the film is so desperate to move onto the next plot point, and pushing some of the best characters to the side, I won't be revisiting this one any time soon.",8
I'm rating it a 10 because it's the Avengers.,9 November 2019,"I'm surprised that almost everyone loves this movie, because there are parts that make me think ""WHAT? WHY?!"" It made me mad at the Russo Brothers until I saw ""Endgame.""",10

YOU SHOSHO NOT MISS THIS!,27 April 2018,"Finally, it arrived.

And what a great addition to the MCU. I just got out of the movies and i am overwhelmed by the emotion.

The russo brothers had a big job cut out for them, and boy did they deliver in style. It is absurd to think about a movie with so many main characters. And the directors achieved it with sheer brilliance. The writers managed to create a tearjerker with perfect proportion of all elements. Nothing seemed out of place in the story. The soundtrack is as always great. The fight scenes are very well choreographed and brilliantly filmed and edited. The villain, Thanos is exceptional. Finally marvel delivered a great great villain. His back story and aim was well done.

Finally i would conclude by saying it's definitely the best marvel movie and also one of the best superhero movies of all time. It definitely deserves all the hype its getting.",10

"Penultimate Movie in the ""KNOWN"" MCU",4 May 2018,"While I absolutely loved Infinity War...and I do mean love, there are scenes in this movie that I have wanted to see my entire life and I was not disappointed. But with that being said I was expecting this to be the greatest movie in the MCU because it was the culmination of the 18 movies up to this point. (I still would put Civil War, Winter Soldier, Guardians, and the original Avengers ahead of it). While 9/10 was the score I give it I feel like 9.5/10 is more appropriate. There was one thing that bothered me in the latter half of movie. This is clearly was a part 1 of 2. That is where my only problem lies. This is what I Imagine will be a better version of what I think Deathly Hallows Part I was to the Harry Potter series... but to the MCU. Highly recommend it but also feels like the episode before the season finale in this big budget tv show known as the MCU",9
The best movie ever,8 June 2018,"When I watch this movie I've got the same feeling when I saw Thunder Cats the Movie ... that moment when you saw all your heroes in one movie ...

Epic!!! A must watch masterpiece!!.. No better way to end a movie when you have a sequel,26 April 2018,"Avengers: Infinity War (2018) is an epic blockbuster.A movie that lived up above the hype. 10 years of building and they made a masterpiece. Thanos..Thanoss.. Thanos.. Thanos brings a whole new definition to fear and destruction. Ultimate villain.

There is no way you can give so much importance to a villain when you have a movie packed with heroes & there is no better way to end a film when u have a sequel ready.

Hope we can fast forward 2018...Can't wait for the next one!!!",10
It has all led to this,1 May 2018,"Avengers: infinity War has been 10 years in the making from easter eggs,references and hints to this very movie throughout all of the MCU and it was all worth it.The Story was well written and thorough,the cast put on good performances,the action scenes were epic,the tone of the movie was one point and it was just an awesome experience.

From the beginning of the it starts of with an intense tone,action packed and yet that contained that Marvel humor and this happens consistently throughtout the film almost near to perfection, thanks to The Russo Brothers directing this continuing their success from Captain America:Winter Soldier and Civil war.The first act was amazing as the movie introduced it's characters swiftly and didn't feel rushed at all with some clever writing and stellar action and gorgeous visual effects.Characters like Ironman.Doctor Strange,Spiderman and Thanos are great from the get go.You really felt there was a genuine danger unlike other Marvel films.

The second act continued with this momentum as you are introduced to more characters like the Guardians,Captain America and more and the movie expands on the villain's plan and motivation as Thanos was a great villain,the best marvel villain if not then at least Top 3 although his goal was to destroy half the universe which is generic,but the movie clearly explains why he wants to do so and his clear motivations,as Thanos is also intimidating and also rather emotional helped by Josh Brolin's terrific performance as Thanos so is the rest of the cast who do a good job potraying their characters,the best performances coming from Zoe Saldana,Robert Downey Jr,Josh Brolin and Elizabeth Olsen.

However since this was a very long movie the pacing was a bit slow and dragged a bit during the second act,but thankfully not too much and i have to say some of the characters from previous movies didn't get as much screen time as others like Captain America or Black Panther which is kind of disappointing their play a minor role in this big superhero film but but that's understandable as there were so many characters in this movie and The Russo Brothers did a fantastic job of balancing each one right even if it mean't some key characters didn't receive a lot of screen time.

Also i have to say some minor thing bugged me a little without spoiling to much this arc involving the Hulk and Doctor Strange which doesn't get full explanations only because it's convenient to the plot and some of the humor from the Guardians of the Galaxy characters was a bit much because of James Gunn not being majorly involved with the movie but again this doesn't ruin the movie,just some minor issues,.

Now to my favorite part of the film,the last act which was completely bonkers,the actions scenes were wonderful and looked like they came out straight from a comic book,the visuals were dazzling and story accumulated satisfyingly and there was a sense of unpredictability from the movie as the movie was dark,intense yet fun at the same time and the story was left completely wide open for Avengers 4 as it ended with a twist.

In the end i think that this is indeed one of the best comic book movies ever made for sure,the best movie of 2018 so far.It had nearly everything heartbreak,a compelling story,some unpredictability,incredible action,fun humor and more and all i have to say if the wait for this movie was totally worth it.",9
The truth,5 June 2018,,10
A movie well worth the 10 year wait.,27 April 2018,"This film, by a universal account, is the best Marvel film I have ever seen. To start off, I am a fair critic of film, and I cannot say that I have full enjoyed each Marvel film, however this one does not fall in that category. The promotional aspect of this movie falls very short in how amazing Avengers Infinity War actually is. The performances were stellar, the action was an achievement, cinematography will blow your mind, and you will be shocked over and over again. You will laugh, your will cry, you will truly enjoy this amazing film. Thanos is given a dynamic the likes of which I have never seen in that character, and I was completely glad to see how they were able to bring him to life on the big screen.

If you've been waiting for this film to come out, wait no longer. Go see Avengers Infinity War, and mark yourself a proud fan and filmgoer. This will be one that cinematic history, and marvel history will not soon forget!

Best Marvel Film to date!",10
Exquisite,26 April 2018,"A must see blockbuster that will make you laugh, shocked, silent, and tear up!",10
"This was THE MOVIE, and the fact that the movie even ended- was a huge disappointment!",28 April 2018,"The major challenge for such a huge movie- was distributing screen time among the ""protagonists""! Marvel almost managed to make it work.

All the big guys of the MCU got their screen time. Some, a bit more than the others, but it didn't disappoint! What did was the fact that not everything gearing up to Infinity War was given enough reel!

I went with some unnatural expectations. I blame Thor: Ragnarok for it- that movie was a game changer- it set the bar real high! And, due to that, with the Infinity War, not all the expectations were met, really!

I felt the film moved a little too fast in the first half, leaving behind some details unexplored. In an ideal world, I would have loved to prolong and detail the scenes and juice up the experience! May be (120 minutes x 2) instead of 1 150 minutes film.

Pros:

The obvious one! Some interesting fight sequences and some inspiring plot movements helped the movie hold the attention. Fight sequences were well managed. Right characters were given extra screen time. justified Infinity War plot better! It brought everything Marvel had been making for last 10 years together!

Cons:

Too many events for one movie. Some second grade characters were given too much of screen time. Too much left unexplained to leave the movie on a cliff hanger. Some incredibly stupid scenes on which the plot directly depended makes one feel that the plot was forcibly pushed on a direction. I was expecting one big wild card entry and one special emotional moment- that didn't really happen! Last 15 minutes were somewhat disappointing. Among other things, the fact that the film ended was heart breaking. This one had only one post-credit scene, meaning, at least one more post-credits was cut out!",8

The only thing amazing about Endgame is Captain Marvel and her new short haircut, but that's about all that shines on Endgame :(.

Nothing short of the best superhero movie ever created (as of 2018),3 May 2018,"I don't need to add much more than what has already been said so I'll instead sum up the pros and cons of this movie.

Pros:
Best villain to date: Thanos is greatly developed and you wanna see more of him
Best action to date: the fights are all fantastically choreographed and epic
Awesome drama and twists: You feel for both the villain and heroes, they have been so well developed and created that each one going through a phase here feels compelling... and it takes balls to go as far as this movie has. BvS, get lost!
Great story: the story itself may be simple (super villain wants MacGuffin to rule/destroy/semi-save the universe) but it's the good ol' formula done at its best!


Cons:


And that's my review of what is easily the greatest MCU movie, the greatest comic book movie and the greatest movie of 2018. Congratulations Marvel/Disney, you have once again shown why you are the juggernaut that you are! DC wishes it was you lol :p",10
Great flic but,5 May 2018,This was beyond the movie I expected. The Russo brothers did a unbelievable job with the cast and story line. The best villain next to Vader was created because you felt for him. The most emotional ending for a marvel movie ever. Beyond excited for the next movie a year from now. Please keep all of us in suspense and questions Thanks for making comic books come alive that have been in my closet for 30yrs.,9
Unpopular opinion: Over hyped!,16 September 2018,,4
I might be biased but...,8 January 2019,This movie is perfect. All of Marvel's favorites coming together to fight the biggest threat the universe ever faced. There are a lot surprises throughout the movie especially the ending. I'm dying to see how Marvel wraps up the Avengers sequel in the next movies.,10
First review of any movie ...,25 May 2018,"I've read many reviews on IMDB and generally I've tended to agree with the IMDB rating for a movie, and I agree with this one. Currently it's showing 8.8 which I think is about right.

If you're a Marvel fanboy, you'll love this movie. It is clearly the culmination of a story started waaaay back. Some have said it begins with Iron Man (1) but I don't see that. As soon as we were introduced to the infinity stones we started on a journey towards this film (and the next).

There is light and darkness in this movie (more darkness than light if truth be told). I don't want to spoil it for those who haven't seen it, but suffice to say I haven't stopped thinking about it since I saw the movie a week or so ago. It's one I'll buy on Blu Ray.

I'm in my 50s and for decades my fav movies were Alien and Aliens. The latest movies from Marvel (and Christopher Nolan) come close to toppling their crown.

I wait with bated breath for the finale..hopefully not too long.

If you have enjoyed any superhero style movie .. you will enjoy this. Its a sci-fi swashbuckle of an adventure.",9
Why should you not skip this?,6 May 2018,"Don't go for the story. Don't even think about watching it for the hype that it has. You might even start treating it as overrated if you are not a fan but just want to judge everything (and of course, the end). But there's a lot more to it than that. You are literally watching 20 or more, greatest actors of this decade, all together in a span of 2 hours 30 min. Included with some of the best visual effects put with such creativity that shows each of their powers used together as a team.

There's every bit of detail kept right on top. Even the characters portrayed have been top notch while crossing over not just for us audience but also meeting for the very first time in the plot. And the kind of reactions they have is exactly what we were expecting. Maybe even better, obviously because they defeat each other at sarcasm.

You'll obviously need a lot of past information before watching this one. I'll leave that to you. The movie starts with the kind of dark tone it has most of the time. It tries to make you laugh and we all do. We scream, we laugh, we ""Ohhhh"", we cry. It is a whole bunch of emotions. It is for every Marvel Fan. And for those who are not a fan, it is for you too, because this is history, my friend. You ought to be a part of it. I hope they remember you.",10
Wow,26 April 2018,"Yeeeeeeah I liked it. It was pretty good. Some pointless scenes, subplots etc but overall... I liked it. The visuals are stunning, I wasn't even watching in 3D or IMAX and my socks were blown off. It was a bold move, mixing everybody together in new places not even on earth- moving away from the more realistic side that was established originally. But it paid off. It did have emotional effect, mostly in one scene with Spider-Man, while the other 'emotional scenes' weren't very riveting. It was full of surprises and I enjoyed it. Good job guys.",10
Finally a overhyped movie that is actually good.,3 May 2018,,9

"bizarre ending, leaves you baffled.",3 August 2018,"First time ever reviewing a movie on IMDB

The film was on for two and half hours and i sat through it. Great for Marvel Fans with all the characters coming together in just one movie.

The Movie was spectacular with the special effects etc. but is it just me, it was the most disappointing ending to a movie i have ever seen. Its like it stopped 10 minutes before the real end of the movie. i still have not got a clue what was going on at the end.

I think this is a movie for Marvel Fans who follow the Marvel movies and the plot. but for the casual movie goer, i found it a weird and total strange end to a movie, where it leaves you thinking what the hell, one minute you are watching it and then it just ends in bizarre without explanation.

I assume they did this ready for the next movie in the serious. but non the less leaves you deflated after watching all the way through.",2
Rollar Coaster Ride,23 May 2018,"This movie was a rollar coaster from start to finish. It was like the movie was split into three sections, each section like each team. So it was like you were going from one location to another and back again. The story was well written though the giant cliffhanger at the end was upsetting. Very much unlike marvel. Josh Brolin, Zoe Saldana, and Chris Hemsworth stole the show in my opinion. The chemistry between Thanos and Gamora was really good. RDJ was as always great and a lot of emotion all round the movie.",9
Awesome,3 May 2018,I wanted to see the second movie right after when i left the premiere one,10
ONLY IDIOTS WOULD THINK THIS IS A BAD MOVIE,1 May 2018,"For all the people who rated this movie badly, SHAME ON YOU not Marvel. Every movie doesn't have to be a happy ending with shining rainbows all day round. Infinity War has broken the traditions of having good endings. Thanos is the biggest bad-ass in the universe and YOU SHOULD ACCEPT that fact. Infinity War is basically a Star Wars-esque movie and Marvel did it brilliantly. It is called INFINITY WAR, yes WAR for a reason so the pacing is a little bit faster than usual yet cost us more than 2 hours. If you are a true deep-thinking Marvel fan, Infinity War is basically a new beginning of something bigger than itself. Kudos Marvel.",10
"Marvel's most thrilling, action-packed movie yet.",20 September 2018,"Th russo brothers truly went all out directing a visual spectaculal, with a great plot, soundtrack and gathering all the MCU characters from tbe 10 years of MCU. Josh Broslin as Thanos steels the film as one of tbe best villians yet. Althouth there are some pacimg issues, this film is definitely ranked high up ad one of the best comic book films I have ever seen.",10
An Epic Culmination of 10 Years of the MCU,26 May 2018,"2 years ago, I watched Civil War and was positively wowed by it, much so that I became an undying fan of the MCU. The MCU is admirable for managing to build an almost 20-film franchise packed with great films all leading up to this movie.

Story: The story (for those who don't already know) is about the Avengers teaming up once again to face their biggest threat: Thanos. The Mad Titan wishes to collect the Infinity Stones to bedazzle his Infinity Gauntlet and wipe out half of the universe. The story is extremely captivating with major surprises throughout the movie and one WHOPPER of an ending.

Direction: My major worry about this movie was how they were going to keep track of several plotlines without it feeling convoluted. And miraculously, the Russos pull off such a juggling act almost perfectly. Some storylines do go on for longer than they should but overall, it never feels overwhelming.

Script: Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely have made a fabulous script with plenty of comedy and yet great dramatic moments. However, some moments do feel too melodramatic and one moment in particular was undercut by a joke but that might the director/actor's fault.

Performances: I can't make this too long (there are over 20 HEROES in this, ok?) but everyone does well. However, Thanos is on another level compared to the rest. Josh Brolin manages to intimidate you as soon as he appears on screen. A serious achievement for Marvel to create such a villain worth the decade-long wait.

Other Elements: As for the other parts, the action is well-done with less shaky cam than previous entries in the Russo's MCU movies. Everything else is fine though.

Conclusion: To conclude, Infinity War truly lives up to the hype, being an entertaining, funny and emotional blockbuster that can delight MCU fans and regular moviegoers alike. In the words of Kevin Smith: It's going to be a long year until Avengers 4...",9
Insane. Emotional. Brilliant.,26 April 2018,"Having grown up with comics in my life, learning about the avengers, iron man, captain America, spider man and so on, 10 years of Marvel films - growing up with them in my life, Infinity War tops it all off.

The Russo brothers, having smashed Winter Soldier and Civil War deliver an exceptional piece of work.

We have known for a long time of Thanos' coming and boy does he deliver! Straight from the get go we encounter the Marvel villain we have been hoping for. Menacing, frightful, evil and damn right punishing!

The way in which Infinity War connects each Avenger with new members like Guardians of the galaxy, Doctor Strange and the Wakandans is mesmerising. You cheer them all on from the start but in a way want to see what Thanos' main goal is throughout.

It delivers epic fight scenes, amusing comedy and great chemistry, Star Lord, Iron Man and Doctor Strange having very likeable clashing personalities and Thor continuing on from Ragnorak and his new sense of destructive 'banter'.

The film, to me, is a 10/10. Any true Marvel fan will agree and come out of the cinema filled with both sadness and pleasure.",10

I have to do my part,26 April 2018,The movie blow my mind and it is beyond my expectation. Just go and see it for yourself. It is just that good that it makes me write my first movie review in my entire life.,10
This is way better than The EndGame,14 May 2019,This movie is way better than the last Avenger's movie. The story and action are superb.,10
Is this THE comic book adaptation? Honest Reviewer's Score: 3/3/3/1,21 June 2018,A full review will be added later on. All that I will say is that this film blew me away. A true mastepiece - having 3/4 of 100 charachters and still pulling it off as one of the highest rated films of all time!,8
A nice comeback from Anthony Russo to start the summer!,26 April 2018,"A moment to rejoice! Welcome to Phase 3 of the MCU. First things first, clever writing from the Russo brothers.

After a long time (since Spidey's Homecoming) the critics are totally in sync with me. Last month I watched Black Panther, and thought it was media-hyped! But today, I found something refreshing. This is the best Avengers assembly ever made!

I watched A:IW in IMAX with Laser and it was nice. This resulted in bright images, especially the galaxy, projected by dual projectors on the giant 42 feet high, 65 feet wide screen of IMAX, completely using the whole screen with a slight chopping of the picture. The images are larger than life. Although they don't confuse the eye but I am still having a strain. Along with 12,000 Watts IMAX proprietary sound system that was used very well for the sound editing!

It may have taken 10 years and 18 movies, but the superheroes have shown redemption. This may have room in the hall of fame!

Spider-man is just a teenage boy but yes,Tony Stark can convince any one and it was watching both of them together again. Thor appreciates Roger's beard. And the suits even support the tone of the film.

Some people in the theater started crying in the end, but I didn't. I don't want to spoil anything, so save your bucks for this blockbuster. Expect a few BO records to be broken and don't forget to watch the end credits.

My significant digit score: 8.5/10",8
Fantastic Movie with Great Writing,27 April 2018,The writing and the dialogue between characters was just fantastic. They really did a great job with this movie!,10
U will regret if you go to toilet..,26 April 2018,Another great superhero movie of all time. Full of actions from the beginning till the end.,9
What?????????,5 August 2018,"Horrible storyline, horrible writing, bad acting. Don't waste your time.",2
Mindblowing,5 May 2018,"I went to the movies with expectations of being a little confused since I haven't seen a lot of the Marvel movies that came out in the last decade that passed. But still, this movie was able to give the perfect amount of background story to make it a compelling movie and then some. I cannot believe how good this movie is. I won't spoil it for you but the last 10 minutes of this movie are amongst the best I have ever seen of any movie. I also noticed he use of foreshadowing for the final scene with expanded my fing mind ever more. The action sequences are incredible and the whole cast did an amazing job, not only with the great comedy the writers blended into the story, but also the heartbreaking and very mysterious sequences of this movie. With all that being said there were some moments in this movie I found to be a little dull (such as the piece of trash that decides to be selfish). I cannot recommend this movie enough though, even for people who aren't particularly fans of superhero movies.",10
Worth the 10 year wait,28 April 2018,Innovative movie. I have waited and theorized for years. The movie was awesome.,10
Heartbreaking and phenomenal at the same time,3 May 2018,"This film has broken me in many ways. But really there is not much to say, i am not going to include the spoilers but can honestly tell you that this time you can believe the hype!",9
Watching this movie is very enjoyable.,12 March 2019,"In this film, Thanos was the most fascinating and also the most complex personality of the story.",10
How to Properly Subvert Expectations,15 March 2019,,10
The Best MCU movie made so far!,1 May 2018,"I did not go into this movie with very high expectations, it looked to me that it would be a mess with all the main characters. I am very happy to say that I am wrong. The way that this film handles all the main characters is great and and did not expect it to be this way. I honestly can't say this is a film, this is more like a three hours of straight climax which is actually done really well. Another thing that this movie does well are the characters themselves. While some characters get more attention then other (for example War Machine gets a lot less screen time than Iron Man), most of the characters are given adequate screen time. One more note about the characters is that Thanos is genuinely the best character in this movie. He gets the most character development of any Marvel villain and any character in this movie. Most of his development in the film is spoilers and I don;t want to deprive anyone of this amazing experience. For those reading this don't spoil the movie for anyone, don't kill the moment some have been waiting ten years for.",9
The greatest story ever told.,29 April 2018,This was the first time in thirteen years I had been to a theatre to see a movie and what movie it was. This is the greatest superhero movie of all time hands down.,10
NOTHINGS CHANGED (REVIEW FOR ALL MARVEL FANS),25 October 2018,"This review represents more than just infinity wars. This review applies to every marvel movie ever made.

Why I hate marvel movies Marvel represents everything wrong with movies from this generation .The marvel universe started off strong in 1944 with captain America which for the time was incredible. Than they started making movies that were aimed at adults such as the Blade trilogy and of cause the punisher which might I add I actually enjoyed. But than the sequels began to this day in 2018 marvel have filmed over 80 movies with an average of 9 movies every 2 years. If this doesn't show marvels true intentions than I don't know what will. Marvel is the most soulless repetitive money motivated film company of all time at this point you are literally paying for the same movie with a different repetitive costume 80 times 5 times a year. let's say you pay $10 for a ticket for every hardcore fan they have wasted $800 of there money times that by about 20 million fans you got $1600000000 going to a terrible franchise that just keeps ripping people off over and over. Than using money and theatre time that could be going to actual good movies. For example Quentin Tarantino's the hateful 8 was postponed for a later released because non other than marvel desided that they wanted to release there film a few weeks earlier. If movies watchers keep supporting these high budget plotless pointless repetitive garbage movies that keep Dwayne Johnson and marvel in business in a few years there won't be any good movies being made. Than we will all be thinking back to the 90s and mid 2000s when movies weren't money making trash and actually had plots and were more than a few good action sequences wondering what happened. The fact that avengers infinity wars is 49th place on the top 250 is disgusting and shows how close we are to the good movie irreversible apocalypse. There are a few good directors left and unfortunately they are getting old and only release 1 movie per few years such as Quentin Tarantino Martin Scorsese and Steven Spielberg. But lucky for us it's not to late just stop buying tickets and merchandise for marvel DC and any pointless action or dumb Adam sandler or Amy Schumer comedy and we might be able to save this planet from the great film Death.",1
Job well done,30 April 2018,"One of my favourite Marvel films, Thanos is just the best villain, bring on Avengers 4",9
🙀,22 March 2019,Great way to set up the end I hope Endgame is three and a half hours long,10
I'm a marvel fan-boy,4 June 2018,"I love this film. For the scale and sheer mass of a project like this I think the Russo's did an amazing job. The exposition is key for me: too much and I'm clearly watching a Michael Bay film.Too little and well, it would be a straight to DVD flick. This is just below perfect for me. It's a 9 because there are inconsistencies in logic that slightly tarnish an otherwise excellent film. I have to remember that it's only 50% of the story so maybe I'll track back and change this amateur review.",10
A perfect Blockbuster.,28 April 2018,"Avengers: Infinity War is not only the 3rd Avengers film or 19th installment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe but also marks the 10 year anniversary since the start of everything MCU with the first Iron Man film. A lot of expectations are put onto this film, this is the film that unites the Avengers with the Guardians of the Galaxy to take down the greatest threat yet, Thanos (Josh Brolin). I will not go too much in depth with the story, only referring to what we saw in the trailers. The cast in this film is absolutely ridiculous, Robert Downey jr, Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Don Cheadle, Benedict Cumberbatch, Tom Holland, Chadwick Boseman, Zoe Saldana, Karen Gillan, Tom Hiddleston, Paul Bettany, Elizabeth Olsen, Anthony Mackie, Sebastian Stan, Idris Elba, Peter Dinklage, Dave Bautista, Vin Diesel, Bradley Cooper, Gwyneth Paltrow, Benicio Del Toro, Josh Brolin and Chris Pratt. With such a huge cast it will be naturally difficult for the writers and directors to successfully balance all of these characters, giving them enough to do. In most cases it works, in others however I felt that more development was required. A good choice by the filmmakers was the idea to split up these characters all over the universe. They were paired up in smaller groups, this gives the opportunity to bring in some of the classic dynamics that we have come to love and also set up some new conflicts. However what was done with one relatively small group in the first Avengers is done here with multiple groups. This causes some characters to lose their strength in development that made them so interesting in their previous films. This is why I recommend to have seen some of the Marvel films beforehand, otherwise this film won't emotionally move you as you aren't familiar with most of the storylines and characters. One of my biggest worries about Infinity War was Thanos, most other villains in the MCU were boring uninteresting entities that the heroes simply had to face and punch their way out. They were never interesting and there was never a sense where the audience could understand them. Luckily Thanos breaks that tradition, Josh Brolin gives a very conflicted performance of a creature that wants balance in the universe, which is why he wants to collect the infinity stones. The audience receives a motivation, (which I will not spoil) that makes this character understandable and to a degree even relatable. You never root for Thanos but you understand him at the same time. Brolin easily gives us the best MCU villain and one of the strongest comic book villains in years, easily exceeding Tom Hiddleston and Michael B. Jordan. The same thing can unfortunately not be said about the hero characters. Some receive extra material that allows them to shine as the great actors they are, notably Robert Downey jr, who adds the typical eccentric charisma of Tony Stark but there also seems to be sense of terror and panic within his portrayal. Downey jr has now played the genius, playboy, philanthropist for 10 years, it's still awesome to see that this Academy Award nominee puts this amount of effort into a role he has now played for a decade. Zoe Saldana also has some key scenes to really shine, especially when she comes to realize who the attacker is. Gamora has never been my favorite Guardian of the Galaxy. However this is the first time where I find her character interesting. Overall Infinity War is a popcorn spectacle with a great villain and some terrific performances, however the different tones can be jarring sometimes and most other hero characters receive very little development.",8
A Mindblowing epic experience....,4 May 2018,,10
Best comic book movie ever. Out of the expectation,3 May 2018,"I am just speechless. I thought it would be great movie but I can not expect that much. This movie have made with lots of super hero. In the previous Marvel movies we saw different movie have different category, like funny, action, brave, talent or sad ending movies. In this movie we found every thing. And this movie's script is out of this world. It is really good. And also there are many mysterious things, for that we need to wait for the next Infinite War movie.",10
A 10 Year Masterpiece,5 May 2018,"This movie shouldn't even be physically possible. 18 movies before it, having to make sure everyone acts accordingly, make sure everyone gets screen time, and that's even before we get into the story. The movie is a masterpiece made over 10 years. No character feels out of place or over-used. I will admit there is one character in particular that could've been used more, but because of how much was going on it makes sense why he wasn't. Characters act like they should, and their chemistry is amazing. The three separate groups all work masterfully together. This movie honest to god had me on the edge of my seat the whole time, which is hard to do with me, especially for two and a half hours. I almost cried numerous times and legit couldn't walk when I left the theater. I had to hold onto my girlfriend so I wouldn't faint. It was that good. And I haven't even gotten to Thanos, aka the best mcu villain. His motivation is so much better then the comics, and he makes every scene feel like it could be the end for a character. You never know what will happen. Overall, this is my favorite mcu movie, and definitely in my top 10 favorite movies of all time.",10
Scatography,30 July 2018,"As I do with all Marvel stuff, I've loaded it onto the tablet I keep in the bathroom. The scenes are perfectly cut for some minutes in there. And it doesn't matter if you don't remember your last visit after a day or two, there's no correlation. Wether it's shapeless, explosive, dripping, ludicrous or misleading, it always ends with the feeling that there could have been more. But even if you try harder for another minute, there's only void. And as soon as you stand up, the whole stuff is flushed out of our memory. Only persists a reminiscence of nauseating miasma. Mankind seems to enjoy it. Well in that case, I've got a be an alien. I've decided to quit eating any fibre to never have to endure it again.",1
A really good surprise by Marvel.,30 July 2018,"It has been a couple of years since I watched a Marvel movie and didn't get disappointed about shortcomings. Infinity War rides off the back of Thor Ragnarok (one of my lowest rated Marvel films) and Black Panther (a decent film, but flawed) both very successful and both very different in tone to each other. Infinity War as the third Avengers film does something that you don't always see happen, normally the third movies are not that good, in some cases are even catastrophic but here Russos bring their directorial power back for a bigger film than CW and thanks to a much more compact and well planned script a much much better film than CW too.

Infinity Was doesn't waste any time and goes straight for the jugular from the very beginning. There is no warmup, no normal life sequences that drag on, there is only real tangible threat and the powerless (compared to the villain) heroes that put everything on the line. The film goes on to shock (well depends on what the audience expects form the film) the audience from the very beginning and paints the picture as clearly as possible, the real strength of this film comes in the fact that the story is very much straight to the point, some might even say rushed but the fact is that this ""rushed"" feeling helps in creating those whiplash like moments where the audience is suddenly thrown off course by big moments that are supposed to get emotional responses of all kind from the audience. The sound design is nice and there isn't anything to complain about in that category really and I personally enjoyed the soundtrack too, the character themes come in at perfect places and they are tweaked a little bit to reflect the changes these characters have gone through. Acting is also very well done in most parts and that should be give considering the names in the movie, however this is the first time that most of these people get to shine in a Marvel movie because normally the scripts are not really on par with the quality of the casts. Here as I have mentioned before script shines bright and in turn helps the cast members to be more than what they normally are. What makes Infinity War really good is that it knows how to balance the tone, the humor is there but kept in check and the closer to the finale we get the fewer out of place jokes there are (altogether there are not many jokes that fall flat and out of place) and that is something that I believe any serious movie watcher would most probably appreciate.

I have to say, Marvel and the Russo's did impress me a lot specially after the taste Thor Ragnarok left in my mouth.",9
"Wow ALL that just happened, and somehow I'm only slightly overwhelmed",13 May 2018,"Infinity War is a jam packed movie with tons of action and story balanced for a nonstop Marvel experience like never seen before. Infinity War managed to cram a solid story, countless characters meshing together, and fun action all in one film that should have been 4 hours long to fit everything in. Seeing the Guardians finally interact with Avengers characters is one of the most satisfying elements of Infinity War. My only flaw WOULD BE that soooo much is jammed into this film. However, the Russo brothers managed to pull it off as effectively as anyone could. The Jam packed film worked and didn't feel like ""too much"" as much as it would if anyone else had Done a film like this. Loved it, go see this!",10
Leaves you wanting more.,28 April 2018,"Avengers: Infinity War continues with the adventures of Tony Stark/Iron Man(Robert Downey Jr.), Thor(Chris Hemsworth), Bruce Banner/Hulk(Mark Ruffalo), Steve Rogers/Captain America(Chris Evans), Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow(Scarlett Johansson) & the rest of the Avengers. The evil intergalactic titan Thanos(Josh Brolin), sets out to find the all-powerful Infinity Stones. The Avengers have to put everything on the line to stop Thanos, before his thirst for never-ending destruction puts an end to all life on Earth.

Avengers: Infinity War is an awe-inspiring film. Directors Anthony Russo & Joe Russo have given us the most ambitious Marvel Cinematic Universe film to date. The final product is a dark, funny, action-packed & emotionally overwhelming movie. The banter among all the various Avengers & the action set pieces are the highlights of the film. The visual effects are flawless. The 3D is eye-popping. The climax of the movie just leaves you absolutely shocked & in high anticipation of next year's Untitled Avengers Movie(2019). The star-studded cast, is the main reason this movie is unforgettable. Robert Downey Jr. is outstanding as Tony Stark/Iron Man. Downey Jr. brings even more emotional depth to his usually fun-loving character, this time around. Chris Hemsworth is brilliant as Thor. Hemsworth portrays a wide variety of emotions, as the film progresses. Mark Ruffalo is fantastic as Bruce Banner/Hulk. Ruffalo provides some much needed comic relief, amidst this generally dark movie. Chris Evans is spectacular as Steve Rogers/Captain America. Evans continues to play his part as the first Avenger, to perfection. Scarlett Johansson is superb as Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow. Don Cheadle is effective as James Rhodes/War Machine. Benedict Cumberbatch is excellent as Doctor Strange. Tom Holland is amazing as Peter Parker/Spider-Man. Chadwick Boseman is great as T'Challa/Black Panther. Zoe Saldana is awesome as Gamora. Karen Gillan is wonderful as Nebula. Paul Bettany is impressive as Vision. Elizabeth Olsen is spectacular as Wanda Maximoff/Scarlet Witch. Anthony Mackie is good as Sam Wilson/Falcon. Sebastian Stan is outstanding as Bucky Barnes/Winter Soldier. Pom Klementieff is great as Mantis. Dave Bautista is hilarious as Drax. Vin Diesel & Bradley Cooper are amazing as Groot & Rocket, respectively. Josh Brolin is highly intimidating & menacing as Thanos. Brolin's character is the best villain in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Chris Pratt is hysterical as Peter Quill/Star-Lord. Tom Hiddleston, Idris Elba, Danai Gurira, Peter Dinklage, Benedict Wong, Gwyneth Paltrow, Benicio Del Toro, Letitia Wright, Tom Vaughan-Lawlor, Carrie Coon & Winston Duke are unforgettable as, Loki, Heimdall, Okoye, Eitri, Wong, Pepper Potts, The Collector, Shuri, Ebony Maw, Proxima Midnight & M'Baku, respectively. Avengers: Infinity War is a must watch. Can't wait to watch it again, in IMAX 3D! Another gem in the ever expanding Marvel Cinematic Universe.",10
Awesome Movie,3 May 2018,I loved this Movie saw it twice Both times it was Great,10
The Best Super Hero Movie,26 April 2018,"I've watch this movie yesterday, on imax screen in indonesia... because this movie was planned years ago, all i can say that this is perfectly executed.. all of the character has been introduced, excluding thanos...

from normal people perspective, i think that thanos way to balance the universe is fair.. he loves to kill and annihilate, but it because his main objective is to maintain balance.

all the hero that i predict will be dead in the movie, it turns out they didn't dead, but others..

from business perspective, Disney will grab lot of money from this movie.. investment in marketing, production etc seems small to their profit..

and on the other side, warner bros exec need to bang their head in the wall, there's no way WB and DC to reach 20% of Disney and Marvel achievement..",10

ALL MARVELS ALL THE WAY,29 August 2018,This movie enforce me to watch again at least 8 marvels movies to understand thi one..... I just cant wait to see the final in 2019,10
Prepare to be cheated,28 August 2018,"The hype of this movie has been .. enormous ... and then they cr-p out this from their b-hind. This gives me the EXACT same feeling as the totally mind-ruining sequence in Dallas .. just before the character Bobby is waking up .. and the last most part of the series .. had just been a dream. I'll eat my shorts if the next movie doesn't have any kind of similarity to that Dallas plot-turnaround. If the Russo brothers wanted to sink the franchise to the bottom .. they sure have succeeded. I know I'm a minority in my opinion .... but maybe I'm one of the clear visioned ones, seeing what this movie really has done as far as ruin the future avengers or marvel movies. I feel cheated of any future experiences. This is not a spoiler, I'm just stating facts, together with my own opinions of a sad and boring predictable action-upgrade for every sequence .. that is the Russo brothers amateurish way of directing a movie.",2

It Delivers,18 June 2018,"I rated this a 10 because it delivered in every way possible. It may not be the greatest movie ever, but without giving anything away, it addressed everything that was hyped. We wanted a movie to kick start the Infiity War, and a movie that was great in its own right. I think that's what we got. And it made the original Avengers (an epic movie when it came out) look minuscule in scale. Thanos is not just a mindless killing machine. We could even grow to understand him. The other characters may still be in their own box, but that's they way we love them. Despite that, they've all developed over the last 10 years, been through their troubles and triumphs. Keen as to see the next chapter in the Mavelverse for Earth's Mightiest Heroes.",10

Boring and childish. The king is naked.,12 January 2019,If this kind of a boring childish screenplay has no much popularity it is saddening. Cannot understand how anyone over the age of 20 would not get bored to death with such a lose infantile story. A lot of computer based affects but no soul and no intellect.,2
Stupid 1'ers,16 May 2018,The film was 1000/10 and people who gave 1-2-3 are stupid. They are probably dc fans and probably didn't understand a thing from the movie.,10
One of Marvel's best movies yet,25 April 2018,"Avengers Infinity War is the culmination of all the Marvel movies since phase one. The movie follows both the Avengers and the Guardians of the Galaxy in their mission to stop the Mad Titan Thanos in his quest to gain all six of the infinity stones, which could potentially destroy the galaxy as they know it. Infinity War is an action packed adventure that utilises all characters to their full potential and highlights them with a detailed story. The story is not only extremely well written but is also true to both the source material and characters.

This is a very funny movie. Characters such as Tony Stark (Robert downy Jr) , Spider-man (Tom Holland), Star-Lord (Chris Pratt) and Thor ( Chris Hemsworth) bring their usual well timed humour to the movie which adds a sense of lightheartedness to the movie which is needed as the tone of the movie can be a little dark at times.

The team up between the Guardians of the Galaxy and the Avengers was seamless and added more depth to the story as well as more humour and banter between characters.

The directors of the movie (Anthony and Joe Russo) have created a movie that is not only well directed but also a movie that is also right in every way. This is one of the Marvel films where everything works. The cinematography is beautiful and the soundtrack is absolutely incredible.

One of the things that really shone consistently throughout the movie was the villain Thanos. Thanos is one of the best MCU villain to date. The Russo brothers really did a great job in developing his story and showcasing him as the villain.

As the film is constantly switching between different characters and paces the film can lack a constant tone and can suffer from a slight drag, but this won't bother most of the viewing audience.

Defiantly go to see this movie if you aren't planning to already as it is one of (if not) the best MCU movie to date. Even if you aren't partially a Marvel fan this movie is still enjoyable and worth seeing.",9
MARVELous!!,4 June 2018,"THE BEST SUPERHERO MOVIE EVER!! Russo brothers have done exceptional job. Everything thing, every piece, every character was used so perfectly that it created Exitement of what will happen next. And I can't wait to see part II.",10
Best Marvel Film without a doubt & possibly one of the greatest,26 April 2018,"This is the best Marvel movie without a doubt if not one of the greatest movie of all time IMO.

As a big fan of Marvel, I had very high expectations & I was worried it wouldn't live up to the hype but this movie exceeded it.

The characters and the casting were great as always. The story was just on point and it is very much a Thanos' story and a movie as the directors said. The pacing is just right so it keeps you on the edge and flows together. I was worried about all the CGI especially for Thanos but man the visuals effects are amazing. He looks so real! Thanos was phenomenal. He was an absolutely badass yet at times a sympathetic villain. You understood him. They really nailed the character. I liked that he actually had a decent motivation. The score fits right in with the scene and really gives you the chills.What can I even say about action.... it is just perfect.

Mostly everyone has a moment to shine in the film. The Russo brothers really managed the screen times of characters pretty well. Everyone has done their part really well & I'm in so much joy.

Do yourself a favour & go watch it in the cinemas. It is brilliant.",10

First part was great,4 August 2018,"If not the immortal stupidity of the actions/heroes in films, it would be a great movie(thinking out loud: just a couple of seconds it was necessary to wait, you idiot). And sometimes I felt like relevant in the previous films jokes, here often inserted just to fill the airtime. In all other respects - an excellent film.",9
"So Obvious, kinda sad, fixable? Maybe, sorta?",6 June 2018,"Okay Disney cats out of the bag that the gifted screenwriters under your thumbs are writing the MCU movies and the thus far way over-hyped flops have screwed up the Star Wars films except Rogue One which wasn't that hard to write being its the crawl to ""A New Hope"". Solos' uninteresting story combined with fact only Harrison Ford is / can be Han Solo, same will show in the recast of Indiana Jones. They would have been better off going way of CGI'd Han Solo voiced by Ford. There was just lame awkwardness from everything out of whatshisnames' mouth, so there was no chance for the lack of weight story within Star Wars Universe. All the would have been interesting backstory was just referred to in conversation like Han's days in Imperial Academy. Could you have imagined the mouths drop if they would have revealed Han's pilot instructor as the Dark Monolith himself, 'Vader'. Any chance for a Vader scene anywhere should be jumped on. It's what puts Rogue One in top three Star Wars films with Empire no.1 and A New Hope and Rogue I consider tied.",10

Over-rated,29 April 2018,,3
Excellent superhero ensemble adventure,6 January 2019,"The story arc continues as ""Earth's Mightiest Heroes"" face Thanos, their most implacable and powerful foe yet, whose goal is nothing less than the elimination of half of the universe's denizens. To do this, he must acquire all six of the infinity stones, colourful MacGuffins with a complex metaphysical backstory - a plot device that allows for a series embedded stories involving subsets of heroes and villains. The story is quite good and relatively internally consistent, and the characters interesting and well worked out (although I have my usual suspension of disbelief problem with The Avengers somewhat asymmetrical powers: Black Widow knows martial arts and is a good shot, Thor is an immortal God who can fly though space and withstand the focussed power of a degenerating neutron star, yet both seem to get equal hero billing). Even the most heavy made-up (or completely CGI) characters have a lot of personality, especially (IMO) chief villain Thanos, emotionally-expressive Mantis, and my personal favorite: giant dwarf Eitri (Peter Dinklage). The script manages to hit a good balance of action/drama and comedy (tricky to do and often a weak point in the genre). The ending is a set-up for the next film, in which we can expect Captain Marvel to put in an appearance (perhaps a harbinger for the next generation of Avengers). Given the God-like powers of some of the heroes and the fact that Thanos can now control reality and time (always a convenient plot gimmick), pretty much anything could happen.",9

MIND BLOWING EPIC !!!!,8 December 2018,"To sum up, this movie is the superhero movies GOD, I think marvel kicked the hell out of DC's butt with this one",10
WOW,26 April 2018,"I can not with words describe how amazing and Well done this movie was! I have been waiting for this movie for so long and i had really really big expectations. But it still blew my mind. I really was not ready for this. When the movie was over i literally felt like i was walking out from a funeral and it was both amazing and absolutely heartbreaking.

This is so big, the movie is huge and it feels amazing to be a part of all of this. Wow and dont even get me started on seeing all the characters from different movies suddenly together. I was amazing to see the energy and chemistry between them. This is definetely going to be the biggest movie of the year!",9
"2.5 hours of film with no content and no ending, amazing!",25 August 2018,"Hollywood achieved a new high in quantity over quality: even more actors, even longer duration, even more special effects, even more chaos (incl. chaos on the script itself, in the sense of entropy vs order), and in the end it felt like a TV episode that suddenly ended just before you see what you were waiting for in the whole duration, to be continued next week, except that in this case it won't. Like 2.5 hours weren't enough to include an ending, so you have to wait for the movie industry's next release, obviously next year (as usual) to see what you were supposed to see on this movie.

Watch the movie if you want to watch for 2.5 hours a completely uninspired, unintelligent and boring plot, been written by a group of writers who obviously were bored themselves in their personal lives, with all usual cliche and banal lines, a film that has nothing to say, and doesn't worth a dime either as fantasy, as science fiction as drama, or comedy. If you add them all, the sum is zero.

Of course, you get a parade of popular actors that participate and serve that worth-less movie, and a series of computer effects. But a film is much more than actors and effects, it is supposed to have essence, inspired messages and stories that worth the time you spend watching, otherwise it's just an effects demo. You can watch many special effects demos on YouTube, on the cinema you are supposed to see a movie, not a demo. So if you want to go to the cinema, or rent a movie, better look for a real movie, one that honors the art of cinematography and you'll come out smarter, not dumber.",1
Best Super hero movie ever.,31 July 2018,"Only Avengers 4 can beat it. Period. The movie has it all. Connected timelines, story, emotions, consequences of every action and not to forget that villain toys with everyone. It's just not a happy ending movie which I might think will piss many kids off. The movie is just mind blowing.",10
The most incredible marvel film made in many years,18 May 2018,,9
A lot better than I expected; I'd have to say it's the best of the genre,1 May 2018,"I'd say about 7/8ths of this movie is topnotch and worth watching. It misses the mark a little near the middle of the second half, but not catastrophically. Altogether it's a uniquely imaginative and ambitious ride. The action is pretty much non-stop and each actor's contribution takes the whole production a little bit higher. I would not have thought this kind of group effort possible, but it's almost as if everyone in the production felt the need to give it their all. Kudos to the directors, Anthony and Joe Russo, who have never tackled such a large project before. They definitely have the sensibilities and eye to make a movie rock.

If I had to rank the performances, I'd have to say Chris Hemsworth, Zoe Saldana, Benedict Cumberbatch, Josh Brolin and Chris Pratt were my personal favorites though I'd hate to do without any of the rest.",9
Perhaps the best Marvel movie yet!,11 July 2018,"Avengers infinity war is the culmination of all what has been built in the past 10 years. Directors had come and told their stories but now it was up to the Russo brothers to put everything together and make all these characters with individual story lines work in a single setting, though that had been done in the previous movies but this film took it to a whole new level. The movie in spite of so many people didn't feel over crowded and everyone got their time in the sun shine. Thanos was an exceptional villain with motivations and goals that made sense. He was powerful, wicked yet had weight in his actions, so great in fact that you think ""Hmm this guy has a point"". Despite Marvel taking a dark route this time they don't shy away from making jokes time to time heck I would say this is the funniest Marvel film yet. I tip my hat to Marvel for making the most funniest and saddest film yet. My gripe about it would be that the Dark order was boring,bland and cliche. Can't wait for what's next!",9
Can I rate this over 10/10 somehow? This is amazing!,15 June 2018,"This movie is amazing, they incorporate the Thanos storyline (which is amazing). They also made the biggest crossover ever, and they made a trilogy good. I loved it, I hope you do too if you can watch this. This is definitely worth your money.",10
An immense crowd-pleaser,27 April 2018,"Entry number 19 in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), all roads have been leading to Infinity War since a Thanos-teasing end credits stinger in 2012's The Avengers (and more broadly since Iron Man kicked it all off in 2008). With Thanos (Brolin) the biggest and baddest threat Earth's mightiest heroes have had to face - and many of the franchise's original stars at the finishing line of lucrative multi-film contracts - the stakes are higher than ever. Even the most popular MCU icons are in life-threatening danger this time around. In the unenviable position of juggling over 20 established characters in a satisfying manner, whilst also delivering the high-end action expected from this series, directors Joe and Anthony Russo get a lot right. Two and a half hours allows for a plethora of mammoth set pieces and the Russos don't hold back. The choreography isn't the most stylish (nor the CGI as polished as it should be), but every dollar of the considerable budget is utilised to craft wall-to-wall action. An exciting first-act sequence teaming up Dr Strange (Cumberbatch), Iron Man (Downey Jr), Spider-Man (Holland) and Bruce Banner (Ruffalo) quickly sets the all-or-nothing tone, but also demonstrates just how difficult the balancing act will be across the lengthy runtime. Whilst Iron Man gets an electrifying entrance (arguably the best moment of the whole movie), Strange never gets to show off his coolest trick, use of the mirror dimension. And where Spidey gets a suit upgrade, Banner gets underwhelming assistance from the Hulk. These trade-offs are littered throughout, with some more egregious (Clint?) than others; however, the narrative pace is so lightning fast that a few character absences or minimisations become more of a concern after the credits have rolled. Where the filmmaking brothers really strike gold is in the barb-heavy dealings between our favourite heroes. Thor (Hemsworth) and Star-Lord (Pratt) are hilarious in their one-upmanship, Strange and Iron Man build a bromance through witty insults, and Black Widow (Johansson), Scarlett Witch (Olsen) and Okoye (Gurira) combine for one scene that tantalises the oft-rumoured all-female Avenger flick. It is a shame though, that whilst Thanos is given the time and dedication to be fleshed out as one of the better villains of the series, his four hench-creatures are visually bland and narratively unnecessary, their design and execution reminiscent of Steppenwolf in Justice League. Although it doesn't break through into the very top echelon of MCU outings, it's not far off either; a few sneaky cameos, consistently delightful character interactions and one of the franchise's best climaxes ensures Infinity War is an immense crowd-pleaser.",8
Spectacular,1 August 2018,"The culmination of ten years' worth of work there's little to say about infinity war other than the highest regards, action packed and straight to the point this film brings a great threat and a fantastic villain and was honestly a great watch at the cinema. At times tear jerking but mostly heart pounding and thrilling this is a landmark in cinema I can't speak anymore highly of it",9
Mindless,3 January 2019,"It's amazing how differently people react to the same movie. I read the accolades this elaborate bit of silliness gets and I just don't understand it. It's a mass of dazzle in its computer graphics but with a story line for low energy morons. The story belongs in a comic book for juveniles. It's nonstop action all right but with nothing else behind it: no story, no suspense, no McGuffin. A real waste of time.",1

In all honesty if you are trying to make a point, let me tell you, you're not. It is stupid and infantile. This is a 10/10 banker. If you can't sit back and just enjoy this film, the humour, the effects, the great action then I could not in all honesty recommended ANYTHING for you.

I am really going to look forward to the next one, at least I hope tbere IS a next one!! This was a thrill a minute, started off at 100 miles an hour and never let up. It has enough in it to keep people of all ages enthralled.

LIKE A SUPERHERO OVERSTUFFED PIZZA,27 August 2018,"Sorry folks, this movie was ridiculous. Not to mention that it was a dishonor to prime superheroes. It was like ""let's see how many heroes and mind numbing perpetual non stop action we can cram into the same movie"" , not caring about the flow, emotion or even if any of it made sense anymore. And seriously guys, after everything that went down in Ragnorok, Thor's long awaited proclimation as King of Asgard and the salvation of the Asgardian people, to have it all decimated in the beginning of this film was total crap. Marvel needs a huge enema for a Disney flush out and bring Marvel back to its glory. Sorry folks.....In my humble opinion, I give it a thumbs down ... and only 2 stars, just for Disney's ballz for pulling this crappy film off. What a shame...Disney got to you too, Stan Lee. They even got you to cut Thor's hair off in Ragnorok....that just about wraps it up.",2

The worst superhero movie ever!,14 August 2018,"What kind of a superhero movie is a superhero movie if they loose? The directors just clearly wanted people to waste money in watching this piece awful movie so that they can again waste money in the next awful movie to get more money with Captain Marvel and Ant-Man. Why? They could have just introduced them earlier and could have made a could superhero movie. This is no way similar to the comics. For a big comic book like me who wanted to see the infinity gauntlet storyline being adapted in live-action ,this movie just ruined. And not just that why do these people show scenes in the trailer that are never in the movie.",1
Unbelievable.. not to be missed!,25 April 2018,"Lives up to the hype and then some! It has everything you could wish from a cinematic event 10 years in the making. All the characters are where we last saw them and this means we'll be taking a ride from places like Brooklyn and Wakanda to many different corners of the cosmos and it does not disappoint! The scenery is always varied and provides some of the most amazing backdrops to this universe wide adventure. The action scenes are fierce, full of emotion and pack a serious punch. As always with the Avengers movies, the character interactions are almost worth the price of admission alone! During an action sequence you are more often than not both afraid to blink, cough or chew cause you might miss something. The stakes have never been higher and this is felt throughout the movie, yet the humor has not been forgotten, it's not in the style of ""Thor Raganarök"" if you were worried about that, but no character is suddenly grim or dark just for the sake of it, everyone acts like you'd think they would. Which brings me to Thanos.. this dude is intimidating as hell, but has a complex personality and is definitely not just evil for evil's sake! Josh Brolin does a great job bringing him to life. The rest of the cast is as good as they have ever been, or perhaps even better since many of them have had so much time in these roles already. It truly is something you want to see on the big screen, maybe more than once!",9
Non-Stop Awesome,30 April 2018,"Superbly written and wonderfully executed. The film delivers from beginning to end. Some CGI is weak but not for the main character Thanos. They accomplish him to the screen in a perfect fashion. The film is 3 movies in one. They squeezed an entire trilogy worth of action, emotion, suspense, and excitement into a single film. The movie is 2hr and 40 minutes in length so plan your bladder accordingly. No handicap patrons had attended the show so after a few minutes into the film, I moved from the very side of the theater to the center of our row where wheelchairs would sit for better seating for my son to see. This led to us being in the walkway for anyone that needed to leave. Every person that had to leave to use the bathroom was literally running to not miss one more second than they needed to of this phenomenal film. I love Marvel (Disney) but have never enjoyed a movie enough to go back, spend money again, and watch it a second time in theater, until now.

Marvel doesn't fail to deliver,2 May 2018,"Of all Marvel films, this is the one where I really expected them to drop the ball. There seems to simply be too many main characters in the universe to make a coherent and satisfying film out of, however I would say they accomplished it.

Not a moment is wasted, but the film doesn't feel like it's rushing all the same. It feels like just enough time is given for each scene to develop each character, and though more could have been done and perhaps 3 hours or more would be more appropriate, it's a very clean and satisfying film that defies expectations. Perhaps the second part will fill out what remains to be explored, and that would bring it to a more reasonable 5 hours, and this film was more just half a story anyways.

This is one of the most dramatic Marvel films to date with the typical humor toned down a bit as to not interfere with the darker aspects, which surely sets it above Doctor Strange in terms of consistency, though the Guardians of the Galaxy are as goofy as ever, which is also neat since all the characters still feel as they did in previous films, which could have easily been muddled with how many directors have brought this universe to this point.

Thanos is probably my favorite MCU villain to date, as he has strong, logical motivations, which is admittedly uncommon among most superhero villains. Though he is definitively a villain, one can see things from his perspective, and can sympathize with him. He may be a bad guy, but his ideologies are not contrived but rather fleshed out in a believable way and shown clearly. It's quite interesting to me how Marvel has now seemed to shift to having the superior villains as opposed to DC.

One of the worst things about this film is actually the trailer, which spoils the climax of the film. This isn't the first time either. Civil War's trailer spoiled two critical plot points in the film, which can be a huge problem when it takes all of the tension out of a scene since you've seen the outcome before the movie even started.

I'd strongly recommend this film, though I'd highly recommend watching as many of the previous films as possible to make this film a bit more consumable. It is a bit dizzying, but that's surely not a deal-breaker given that it's so competently executed.",8
absolutely great!!,2 May 2018,"Already seen it twice, will see again in the theater next week Thanos is badass!! this movie is the greatest even exceeding IMO Jurassic Park 1, Star Wars I-VI, The God Father, Batman Nolan absolutely great!!",10
AMAZING!!!,2 May 2018,"I went into the theatre almost being prepared to be disappointed. Just because it was part 1 and a lot of times the first part of movies aren't the greatest. But wow! This movie blew me away. Is was really great. There were sad moments, but also comedic relief that didn't make it come across like they were fitting to many genre's in one movie. The end of the movie will shock you and make you realize that marvel movies can still surprise you. They really put a twist on things that you won't expect. So if your iffy about seeing it because you were disappointed in Civil War. Don't be. The abundance of characters did not ruin the movie at all. I highly reccomend WATCH THIS MOVIE.",9

Brilliant movie,22 January 2019,,10
Closing Walls and Ticking Clocks,27 April 2018,"I can't say much without ruining this film so instead I will just give a very vague overview of the movie with no plot points and no spoiling will be done. As you will probably have guessed this movie has been anticipated since 2012 when the first Avengers had hit the screen. This sort of thing had never been done before on the big screen with a group of characters. It was the turning point and issued in the Golden age of Marvel comic book movies.

Six years later we finally get to see Thanos and his search for the infinity stones. Thanos is probably the best Marvel villain since Loki and we see why he does terrible things. His reasons are actually quite justified in a sick sort of way and play on the human idea of overpopulation.

For a film with so many characters I think the story does a great job of giving screen time to all however some of the characters do things that are out of character a bit. The film does drag on a little too much and has the habit of sometimes sacrificing a good character development scene for action. Saying that, the action sequences are probably the best in a long while from any marvel movie. Because this is the serious Marvel movie as well the comedy does suffer quite a bit and I does kind of kill the scene for me when a joke is said as it is not really in keeping with the seriousness of the film.

The score is very great as well and they even threw in a new guardian of the galaxy song to announce when they are on screen. The score is pretty textbook slow piano stuff and the do use a lot of the dramatic violin which has become a bit of a cliché at this point. Overall every technical aspect of this movie is flawless. The CGI works really well and it is everything we come to expect from a Marvel movie.

This movie feels like an ending in every sense of the word. Things transpire and characters do irreversible things. It really felt like I was watching the peak of superhero movie franchises and certainly a change in the status quo of Marvel movies. Although I enjoyed the movie very much, I couldn't help thinking ""where do we go from here?"" People have been saying for a while that superhero movies have had their day and infinity wars feels like a swan song.",10
Amazing,26 April 2018,"Everything Disney did wrong with Star Wars the Last Jedi, they did right with Infinity War. It's the Empire Strikes Back of the MCU. The current situation will be a great start for Avengers 4.",10
Good but didn't fulfill the hype,5 May 2018,"Infinity war was good but the hype surrounding it made for a slightly underwhelming experience for me. So many heroes and with so little screen time, it just lacked the charm we've been used to with the last few Marvel films.

Solid 8 for me. Whereas Thor: Ragnarok and Black Panther for me were definitely 9's.

Very good acting and action scenes. It's by no means a bad film, it's very good but falls slightly short of Marvels own standards as of late.",8
This is a Masterpeace,26 April 2018,"The first thing that i will say is that if you dont see this movie in the theatre you will regret it because this will go in history as one of the best movies ever made. The characters,the visuals,the action are all top notch. Thanos is the best MCU villain and probably the best comic book villain aswell. The ending of this movie alone deserves an Oscar. Go see it ASAP Because trust me you dont want to get spoiled.",10
Why this film souldn't be so well rated,3 August 2018,"I had to make a list of why this is so poorly made after seeing the film (I even made my account just to do this). It makes me really mad because it promotes bad films with a high budget, but i will try to convince you not to waste time watching it :

1 - lots of scenes which don't add anything to the story, this film could be 1h40 long without any probleme 2 - fighting scenes without any tactic and where everyone waits it's turn 3 - fighting scenes scenes with explosions (is it supposed to be entertaining ? ) and no tactic, they simply punch and kick 4 - they give up stones too easely (which apparently could save the universe, but why do it ?) The caracters don't know how to make a choice 5 - The actors speak a lot but are not that good 6 - aside from the scenario, the film isn't even interesting visually nor the audio

Making more arguments is actually hard because this film is just about idiots fighting and ""jokes"" over and over My one star is to balance all theses undiserved good reviews, I personally think it should be rated with a solid 3,5",1
Infinity War is truly a masterpiece,26 April 2018,,10

THEHURRICANE,2 June 2018,,10
Infinity Scores !,30 April 2018,"Thanos is coming. That's about all I can write for a plot synopsis without delving into the many potential spoilers that ""Avengers: Infinity War"" contains. Obviously, Earth's mightiest heroes will stand against him, joined by the various other characters that the MCU have introduced in the decade of success we've enjoyed since ""Iron Man"".

""Infinity War"" is one of the rare films that, for me, lives up to the gargantuan hype that has revolved around it, since is announcement. Tonally, it's spot on. The moments of levity releasing a tension that caused by the honest belief that this is going to be the end for some of the characters we've spent that happy decade with. Somehow, despite the history with the previous 18 movies, that the heroes will win in the end, there's a sense of purveying dread throughout ""Infinity War"", that any encounter with Thanos is going to be the last time we see that character and if it's even possible to stop him, the cost is going to be astronomical.

Marvel are often accused of having a problem with their Villains, but that is not the case here. It really is Thanos' film, he's in virtually every scene and even when absent he's the focus of discussion from the other characters. It's testament to Josh Brolin and the writing and animation teams that Thanos is not simply some genocidal madman, he believes in the justification of what he's doing and the price he's had to pay to do it.

One of the initial concerns I had was how they would balance the 50 odd named characters without making them token. My concerns were unfounded - the writing team do a masterful job of explaining why each hero is where they are and their justifications for staying or travelling to where they do. It's full of little hero moments, that make your heart beat a little faster and as I say above, the comedy is spot on. Doctor Strange is much more compelling here, than he was in his solo film - the sorcerer supreme at the height of his powers, his dialogue, event he early comedy is much better written than before. The heaviest work from a hero point of view is probably done by Thor, who continues to show the character development across his films arc, and the humour that Chris Hemsworth is becoming so adept at.

The ending (No spoilers here) is perhaps the only real blot on the copybook. Despite the immediate shock of it, you realise fairly quickly that it's . . . not going to stick, I guess is the best way to describe it and that next year's Avengers film will be about sorting out the situation that they are left in. But this is a relatively minor quibble, soon routed by the realisation that we're actually only half way through an epic story of loss and redemption.

One year to wait until Avengers 4, I will be counting the days.",9
Amazing,22 August 2018,No movie can be perfect. No movie can be 10/10 but Infinity War comes close. All the surprises and action kept me on the edge of my seat (cliche but what else could I say to describe it). All I want now is to know what Stan Lee's cameo will be for Avengers 4. 'Nuff Said,9
BEST MARVEL MOVIE EVER??!!,10 August 2018,Where do I even begin? Avengers Infinity War is one of the best if not THE BEST Marvel movie that I have ever seen. Everything in this movie was excellent from the acting and action to the special effects and music. Josh Brolin nailed his performance as Thanos and gives one of the best supervillain portrayals.,10
THE BEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME!!!,3 May 2018,"Before I seen the movie I new it would be great, but when I left the theatre I thought it was mind blowing epic! It was definitely the best MCU movie of all time! It was definitely more intense then other MCU films but it was also greater, and it is a marvel movie so it has some humour threw out. It would has every thing I like in a movie.

Most people who aren't really into the MCU will not understand the end. But me I'm a huge MCU fan. If you are going to see this movie in theatres you will want to see captain America civil war before you go see it. From the beginning to the end it was so exciting and stressful, a little dark at some parts,

The marvel cinematic universe is going great, some people think that maybe this was the end of the MCU but it's not they have so much more planed.

So this movie deserves a ten star rating.",10
Awful!,28 April 2018,"Even if I overlook the Witzelsucht - the lame, inane attempts at humor - there are many other reasons to dislike this movie. Instead of expending the effort to portray the hulk longer than one moment, it actually upscales a little person. WTF? I will never pay to see another Marvel production!!",1
Great popcorn movie!,4 May 2018,"Great popcorn movie! Action, humor, picture, everything on its right place. Of course it's not the one I'm going to see again and again, but very good choice for weekend evening",9
Great piece of CGI entertainment,26 April 2018,"This movie is packing many aspects into its backpack and amazingly it succeeds delivering all of it. How is it possible to fit massive load of heroes on screen? Is the directing and cutting hasty, editing messy?

The answers are; Very possible and no, there isn't anything wrong with the linearity of plot and scenes.

Russo bros have obviously been workshopping the content for years and it has paid off. Presentation works, no side jumping plot, fitting many top actors with enough dialog to keep everyone on the board with his/her favourite superhero along the ride.

Movie actually is best of superhero movies that have been made till this day.",9
An extremely emotional film,27 April 2018,"I actually don't know what to say. This had some uh very big twists. It does not end how you would think with a major comic event happening. Uh my theory was right but I've told very few people so. Let's just say I laughed, I cried tears of joy, W specially when cap came in and the avengers theme played, and I cried tears of sorrow when four legitimate character deaths happened and at they very end when something big happened. Very big. Thanos was well done. He was a very menacing villain, possibly the best MCU villain and is actually relatable. A character we've longed to say again comes back. One we haven't seen in almost a decade, wink wink. The black order was ok. Wished we could have learned more about them but it's ok. A lot of the trailer content was not in the movie. However most of that should be on Blu-ray. A character is teased in the end credit scene but they troll with the usual mod credit scene which is actually not there and the ""this character/team will return"". That honestly was a mixed bag with the other viewers. Highlight was this one guy who saw the solo trailer said wait not on that the fourth when the realest date came up and multiple crying and oh man is that nova, oh it's the defenders form one dude. He was ignorant and also said there are three parts although the Russo brothers stated there are no parts. Each movie can stand alone. And there were multiple NO *cries loudly. So be weary with your audience. The cgi was rough in very few places and acting was good as always and the pairings of the hero's is notable. One being tony and strange. They were a good duo. The movie so many twists I couldn't even explain. I'd have to rewatch the movie before I can explain it. Overall with all the moments where you feel like yelling with joy, my audience as well as I sure did and very loudly on my part, and the multiple crying moments this movie probably deserves a solid 8/10 but with all the actually good things a movie needs like a solid story big surprise out of nowhere and solid pace this as of right now gets a 10/10. I'm definitely seeing this again and will probably cry myself to sleep tonight.",10

EPIC and ASTONISHING,26 July 2019,"I love this movie. I'm basically blown away for the entire runtime, even on the fifth viewing. Action packed and epic. The perfect amount of funny. Filled with beautiful shots. An awesome story with a beastly villain who you begrudgingly sympathize with.

I can't believe how many characters are in this movie, as well as the mammoth of a cast that comes with it. So many memorable scenes, and when I say memorable, I mean I remember the exact moment I first witnessed them. The music frequently gives it a Shakespearean tragedy vibe. Well done on all fronts.

If you like original, thought provoking movies that test you're senses and deliver new experiences, with strong well built characters, unique stories, excellent acting and ground-breaking directing... Then you won't like this. Another year, another endless array of comic book movies; there's a reason non of them never get nominated for best picture & it's not a good one.",1

Thor's one man show....,17 June 2018,"World-shaking events are kid stuff in ""Avengers: Infinity War,"" the first installment of a two-part sequel to ""The Avengers"" and ""Avengers: Age of Ultron."" The whole universe is under attack from Thanos, an infinitely villainous villain sporting a multicleft, prognathous chin. Universe-shaking throwdowns succeed one another with truly stupefying regularity as the Avengers and their Guardians of the Galaxy allies take turns rising to the challenge. But moments that touch the heart are few and far between in this almost-culmination of a decade of Marvel Comics movies. The finale, scheduled for release in May 2019, may well bring the adventure to fittingly grand fruition. What's on screen now, however, is table-setting for events to come, a groaning board of superheroes, a superabundance of undifferentiated superpowers, and an ending that's more exciting than anything that precedes it.",10

The Build Up We've Been Waiting For!!!,11 May 2018,,10
"""AVENGERS:INFINITY WAR""- MY REVIEW",20 July 2018,"Avengers: Infinity War, directed by Anthony and Joe Russo( who gave us the terrific Civil War and The Winter Soldier), is what we can term as a satisfying summer spectacle. This is not a film. It's an event. In a film with more than 20 superheroes, not once does one feel that any one of them are underutilized.

The plot, as you all know , is about the conquest by Thanos (who is a computer generated character and given a terrific motion capture performance by Josh Brolin), to conquer all the 6 infinity stones and to wipe out half the universe. It's all up to the Avengers along with the Guardians of the Galaxy to stop his evil plans.

That's all I can tell u about the plot. Because revealing too much will kill the experience. The director(s) have packed in all they can - marvelous action set pieces, humour, twists and dramatic moments etc.... Almost all the department have done their jobs neatly. Be it the stunning VFX or the exhilarating background score , the film has it all. The climax, I would like to mention, is not at all what you would expect, especially since this is a Marvel movie. Also the character deaths too will come across as a shock. Now coming to the performances, the list is going to be too long if I mention each and every actor. Everyone has done their roles perfectly and not once do you feel that a single character is given prominence. But a special mention has to be definitely given to Brolin for his outstanding performance. He is a villain that's menacing and heartwarming at the same time.

Hats off for the director(s) for undertaking a project of this magnificience.

So all in all this an experience or should I say THIS IS the Marvel movie we all waited for. So go in and have a Blast. My rating- 4.5/5

P.S: Do not miss the END CREDITS...",9
Stop reading this and go watch it!!,30 April 2018,,10
ugh,29 August 2018,"I will only say that this movie is twice as long as it should be and has way too many characters. I won't even try to guess why they did that. I love Marvel and have a huge tolerance for bad movies, but by 29 minutes in I was ready to give up. If all the bad stuff had been cut out this would have been a great 90 minute movie.",2
"Unbelievably, this movie lives up to the hype",25 April 2018,"This is a non-spoiler review. I recommend watching the film without reading any reviews, but if you insist, here we go.

I'm not sure that I have ever been more excited to see a movie, despite being just a casual fan of the MCU (I've seen them all and like quite a few of them) The Winter Soldier and Iron Man being my favorites. (none of them rate above an 8/10 for me, they all fall in the 6-8 range). I stayed well away from tv-spots, interviews and early reactions, got the earliest ticket to the biggest screen in town and I am so glad that I did. This movie not only lives up to the unbelievable hype, but is also the best entry in the series to date.

The first 45-50 minutes of this movie is some of the sharpest, fumiest, action-packiest entertainment i've ever witnessed, it just doesn't slow down, and right when you think it does, it whips right back into it. The first act of this movie is as good as any third act in any comic book movie, accept funnier. If you didn't come for a laugh however, fear not, the movie eventually does take a breath to cover the more weighty parts. Speaking of taking breaths, the effects in the film are outstanding, almost every scene has something that impressed me, be it an establishing shot, a Raccoon closeup or a comic-come-to-life action extravaganza.

Okay so how is the action? Picture the hand to hand combat from The Winter Soldier, the airport scene from Civil War and the battle for New York from the first Avengers, now imagine that they are all happening at once. Although the latter two obviously have the biggest influence because of the scale this movie is on, there is an added element this time around, and one that has been missing for far too long: stakes. Red, juicy stakes and with an extra dose of salt.

Okay but the characters, how are the characters? First of all... they are great. The insurmountable task of balancing, what, 40 A-list actors? (holy shit that's a big cast) is pulled off effortlessly by the directors. Of course there are characters that get less screen-time than i would have liked, such is the nature of the movie, Shuri in particular was a let down since i came out of Black Panther really loving that character, but hey, i understand. Thor was a standout for me, Chris Hemsworth was simply magnificent throughout, and after such a perfect portrayal in Ragnarock, somehow outdoes himself.

This movie made me feel what i think a lot of people felt when watching The Avengers for the first time, personally I don't love that movie, I love bits in it, but as a whole I ""only"" like it. But every 5 minutes of this movie I felt myself smiling, laughing out load, wanting to stand up and cheer in a way that movies usually dont make me, I was hooked in every sense.

For this reason I have decided to rate it, again ""only"" a 9 out of 10 (which i pretty high for me) because i simply can't yet know how much i was simply caught up in the moment. Don't get me wrong, there is nothing wrong with getting caught up in the moment, but I want to see it again to see how it plays when i know the outcome and am not constantly out of breath. Watching Age of Ultron for the second time, i didn't love it as much as I did the first time (although i still like that movie more than most) so my score right now lies between a 9 and a 10 and a second viewing will decide on which side it falls.",9

An Epic in all respect,26 May 2018,"Waited till May 11th to see it on IMAX in mainland China. The theatre was filled. The line of people waiting winded outside into the mall. People were excited before they went in, and hyped after they came out. The best cinematic experience ever. There were indeed a lot of characters, each and everyone of them loved by so many fans, had their moments in the movie. Some has more screen time, some less, but not even one second was bad. All the pieces and moments were good, in a way that it either pushes the story line or build up the characters. As someone who's more fond of the original Avengers, I do have some complaints about the Guardians' lengthy journey compared to the short appearance of my beloved Steve Rogers and Black Widow. But if you take the storyline into consideration, the Guardians were indeed more intertwined into the plot. So I understood what the directors wanted to do. But, again, why can't there be more backstory about what Steve Rogers and Black Widow did after the Civil War? Instead, I had to look at someone eating snacks for over a minute~ I laughed at that scene, but, I still wished that I had seen more of Steve Rogers and Black Widow after waiting sooo long for this Averagers film. Even though I still LOVED this movie. It's definitely going into my blue-ray collection.",9

The Marvel franchise went downhill since Iron Man 3 which hurts so bad considering he is my number 1. But this movie took the cake. There were so many inconsistencies, so many random characters which weren't introduced in the MCU (only in the comics). There were far too many big egos and sub plots to try and cram into one movie. And to the masses, it was good. So hats off to them for making a crowd pleasing movie. But to the others who like some sense and substance when they pay good money to see a movie, try harder.",5

I dont think this movie can really be reviewed or compared,because it has no peers.It was a roller coaster ride and i was left wide eyed and grasping at my seat the WHOLE movie,THIS is what 10 years of building can accomplish,and i think every comic book enthusiast should watch this movie,it doesn't get any better.

Avengers: Infinity War is possibly the best Marvel film so far!,16 July 2018,"Avengers: Infinity War is possibly the best Marvel film yet! Out of all the Marvel movies that have been released over the last couple years, there are none as special as their last, Avengers: Infinity War. Infinity War is an intense, action-packed film with every superhero in the Marvel Cinematic Universe fighting against the mad titan Thanos. Ever since 2012's The Avengers, Thanos has been a potential threat to the universe. The way that Marvel linked this film with the films in the past is also very impressive. All in all, Infinity War is Marvel's number one masterpiece full of dynamic characters with astonishing chemistry, dramatic, thrilling moments left and right, and an emotional storyline that has consistently built up in the franchise. One thing that is instantly noticed are the amount of characters in the film. Almost everyone in the Marvel Cinematic Universe is in Infinity War. Having all these famous characters like Thor, Thanos, and Iron Man combined into one film is both awesome and breathtaking. Not only do all these characters connect with one another, they also have amazing chemistry. For example, every scene with Tony Stark and Dr. Stephen Strange are both hilarious and intense because both of their personalities are very alike, therefore, creating a clash. Marvel does a very good job grouping these characters, both alike and different, together to make the audience laugh and fall in love with these characters even more. Marvel movies are always known for their suspenseful moments of action and heroism. What's nice about Infinity War is that there are so many characters that have their own fight scenes. For example, there is a scene where Captain America, Black Widow, and Falcon fight two members of the Black Order, while another has Spider-man, Iron Man, The Guardians of the Galaxy, and Dr. Stephen Strange taking on Thanos. The fact that everyone is fighting to save the universe against only one villain makes it even better. Not only is Thanos one of the most known villains in the Marvel Universe, he is also the most misunderstood villain. Thanos is a very complicated character to understand. He is always seen as this evil tyrant who wants to wipe out half universe, but, if you really try and look at it from his point of view, you may think otherwise. There is a scene in the film where Thanos and Dr. Stephen Strange are having a conversation. Thanos uses the stone of reality to show Strange that he was born on the planet Titan and how it's corruption led to its demise. He reflects his possible solutions on how he could've saved Titan, but it's genocide. Strange says to Thanos, ""Congratulations, you're a prophet."" ""I'm a survivor."" Thanos states. ""Who wants to murder trillions!"" says Strange. Thanos says to Strange, ""With all six stones I can simply snap my fingers, and they would all cease to exist and I call that mercy."" This shows that in Thanos' eyes, he is doing the universe a favor. He believes that the universe needs to be balanced, even if it comes down to wiping out half the universe with a single snap of his fingers.

Out of all the Marvel movies, this has been the one fans have waited the most for. Marvel is known for having many ending cutscenes that link past films together. The storyline building up to this film is both long, dramatic, and intense. The first film that Thanos is considered a potential threat is 2012's The Avengers. Almost every film after that has a scene of Thanos getting more and more eager to control the universe. For example, in 2014's Guardians of the Galaxy, Thanos is seen several times throughout the film plotting how he is going to obtain the power stone. The amount of time Marvel has taken to setup this film shows how special it really is. Overall, Avengers: Infinity war is a very special and remarkable film. It is full of amazing, action-packed moments, fabulous characters with astonishing chemistry, and has a long, emotional storyline that has consistently built up in the franchise.",10
A masterpiece in film history!,15 June 2018,"When I first walked into the theatre I was already so excited...during the first 5 minuets of the film and had a wirl of emotions. The movie had such great everything! The music,special effects, acting and twists. I even clapped at one part! The movie is excellent and you should consider watching it because it's very enjoyable, and even if you don't necessarily like the movie then still appreciate the directors for working with so many of these iconic hero's and squishy all of them into this film and having to handle this massive movie....so congrats to you Marvel and the Russo brothers you made a filming masterpiece in my eyes and hope you all see that too.",10

Pointless,18 July 2018,"To a certain degree most super hero movies are pointless as they are mainly about beings with super powers and in flamboyant costumes duking it out at each other. And, seeing as I grew up reading super-hero comics, that is just fine.

However, without getting into any spoilers, this movie could have ended the first minute as the end-result would have been the same as watching the whole thing for 2+ hours. So I guess you could say that this game was a setup for the next Avengers movie, which seems to have become the norm these days.

But disregarding that, there are a number of other weak points in this movie such as:

Hulk was a massive disappointment and made his weakest contribution so far of any Avengers movie. And it was never explained why.

Vision was another disappointment as apparently the Black Widow, who has no super powers, could hold her own against someone who was mopping the floor with Vision.

Some young girl in Wakanda, who I never heard of in the comics, is apparently more intelligent than both Bruce Banner and Tony Stark as she came up with a solution, in about 5 minutes after been presented with the problem, that those other two hyper-intelligent people could not come up with. I suppose that is because of feminism?

Loki made a very uncharacteristic choice which quickly made him irrelevant in this movie. Why then even have him in the movie to begin with?

Dr Strange, who was pretty good in the movie, didn't seem to stand much of a chance against a Thanos henchman but apparently could go toe to toe with Thanos himself?

Thor was easily swept aside by Thanos, in the beginning, yet by the end seemed to be the only one who could actually defeat Thanos, just because he had a weapon. Yet in Thor: Ragnarok Odin suggested that Thor, was more powerful than Odin and did not need any weapons as he said: Are you Thor: son of Hammers?

I could go on and on but this is basically a very nice action movie with some great performances from actors such as Josh Brolin as Thanos. But don't think too deeply about it as it is just an action movie and not much more.",5

Never has there been such an assemblage of notables in one film, and never it seems has one film taken so much money at the box office in its first weekend. Let's face it, this is not just one film""......it's taken us ten years to get here, ten years of Marvel wowing us with good, not so good and fairly awesome film, ten years to introduce us to all their heroes and villains and I have to say, if you're going to put them all in one film......this is surely the way to do it. Some of our early heroes are ageing but what's a little make up between friends and well hey it blinkin works. This film is not a single story, it's a gathering of many tales told in many different ways, with all paths heading on a collision course. I can't tell anything of the plot without massive spoilers but what I can say is, it's great meeting all the characters again, spending a couple of minutes fitting their individual pieces into one massive jigsaw as you remember what their role is in the story, and another thing, it made me want to go back and watch all the other films again.

It might be a little fast paced for some people.

Now that's a movie!,17 May 2018,"Call it a secret recipe for great film making, marvel keeps getting better and better!!",9
"Spectacle and weight, perfectly balanced",25 April 2018,"A culmination of the first 10 years of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It's kind of insane of far they've gotten. There isn't any major development on previously established characters in this one. But that's OK since we have 18 other movies where you can get to know everything about them. Thanos is the man who's at the core. It's really good because now the villain isn't sidelined at all. Bold chances are taken, which actually makes you feel the important weight that this movie needed to bring. All in order for it to leave a greater impact and resonance compared to what the MCU has done before. It's a theme park ride, but with real care put into it. It's not merely action and special effects for the sake of it. There's a real humanity at the core of this extravaganza.

I'm the guy who doesn't read the Marvel comics. I've become a fan of these characters because of the MCU films. I knew nothing about Iron Man or Thor or Captain America. Now I have gotten to know them throughout the years thanks to this series and I feel a greater appreciation for them. The films haven't been fantastic masterpieces or anything, but they have given you what's necessary: An understanding of the hero. They have also brought some great fun and the adventure that you may want in a movie going experience. However, this time you are given something extra. There is a reward for having gone through 18 films. You can nitpick this because of tonal shifts and focusing on so many story-lines. I honestly think it's very impressive how it was put together in the end. Must have been a nightmare juggling what could have been a complete mess. Thankfully it isn't.

Try to stay away from spoilers since this is definitely ""Mic Drop: The Movie"". I will say one last thing before ending the review and please stay with me on this one. People say that there's going to be Marvel fatigue because there's been so many superhero movies coming out every year. And with some of them I understand. The Repetitiveness has been felt. But look back at the 50's or 60's when the grand epic super-scope films were based on mythological stories or historical figures or biblical tales. Movies like ""Jason and the Argonauts"", ""Ben-Hur"", ""The 300 Spartans"" etc. Those were often pure spectacle with a huge scale and the masses went to see them because they were events. The plots were adapted from very old stories. Archetypical stories with classic heroes and villains. All of those stories have been adapted by now. So the Marvel films are kind of acting like an equivalent of that for modern times. The superhero stories are from newer sources, but they feature similar archetypes. They have pretty much become replacements of the epic films from back then. The mythological stories are much older than the comic books and are naturally more respected and known. Superhero tales are more recent, but when you break it down to the core, they carry on that legacy. So take it easy with them and enjoy the experience.",9

Unexpectedly amazing!!!!,10 July 2018,"I was bought a ticket at the cinema for this film and didn't really want to go. Don't get me wrong I love Marvel, I love DC more but everything Marvel is good and worth a watch but I thought this film was a step too far for the cinema, I couldn't really be bothered after Black Panther, another Marvel movie, groan....... Anyway, the actually film was flipping amazing!!!! There was none of the back stories or build ups or fluff pieces it was just a load of super heroes kicking backside!!!! Thor just owned it to be honest, Iron Man is awesome and my favourite character, Downey Junior carries the character now to be honest, they just keep increasing his powers probably to match these super duper evil guys but I dont think they need to, he is awesome as he is without extra nano super ridiculous hammer tech!! Make the armour harder and the beams more powerful to be honest or something, he doesn't need guardians of the galaxy god powers manipulating his suit. Anyway, the film is the beat yet even though I didn't want to see it, THOR rocks.",10
"MCU didn't push any safety buttons, they went beyond your conventional superhero movies.",25 April 2018,"I've never thought, ten years ago, that this is even possible. But thanks to the brilliant minds working in the MCU for piecing together all ten years of work into one grand film, and to the Russo brothers for doing their job again.

This is not your conventional superhero blockbuster, MCU didn't push the safety button here, they went beyond anything we've ever experienced in a superhero movie. And they know they need to step up because this isn't an ordinary movie event, forget about the Justice League.

From the opening scene, you can already sense the dread and the heaviness of this film, the humor is still there and the 'relief' in comic relief is more apparent this time because you can feel an air of unease throughout the film.

It felt to me, though I'm not sure if it's intended, that Thanos is the center of the film, it was all about his character and his quest. And I liked that idea, it gives Infinity War another twist.

I've got so much to say here, but I'll leave it in my second viewing.",9

Avengers Infinity War Review,22 May 2018,"Avengers Infinity War is a film directed by the Russo Brothers. This film was my most anticipated film for this year and I can definitely say the same for every MCU fan out there. I viewed the film very late and knew how much I had to wait. But the wait was worth it.

Plot: The Avengers team up with the Guardians of the Galaxy to stop Thanos from obtaining the 6 Infinity Stones.

Story and Direction: The Russo Brothers and the writers had a huge and daunting task of bringing all of the characters that we loved for all these years into one big movie. And I can just say that they did an excellent job. Never for a moment do you feel that the characters were not given space and time to do what they wanted. The character work for this film is just flawless and I think Thanos was just the best villain MCU ever had. Although he is strong and kind of undefeatable, he has emotions which provided a lot of weight to his character. The film is has a much darker tone compared to other MCU films. The stakes in this film are very real and never there is rest for the mind. You do feel the tension lingering around and feel for the safety of your characters. But the film does retain that Marvel brand of humour in places. And all of the jokes are very funny and do provide relief. Given the film was shot on IMAX cameras, the visuals are just awesome. I had goosebumps just looking at how beautiful this film looked. Also the action scenes were awesome. And the VFX was just jaw dropping. Action scenes were just awesome. Although there were some shaky cam scenes, but they were just perfectly handled. The score by Alan Silvestri was quiet good and complemented the scenes very well. Also the film doesn't end in a very peculiar way. It takes a very different route, which was very well appreciated. I did have one little issue but here I am being quite nit-picky. Some scenes in the trailers didn't make it to the film which was disappointing and also the Thor storyline didn't feel much important to the film.

Performances: The Avengers and The Guardians were just awesome with Thor being my favorite character in the entire film. His presence and his comic timing were just awesome. Idris Elba and Tom Hiddleston too deliver good performances. Josh Brolin was just excellent as Thanos. Every time you watch him on screen you do feel that he was just the correct choice. Also the Black Order was nice to watch. And finally, Peter Dinklage. He also delivered an earnest performance for his role.

Favorite Scene; It would be Thor's scene with the Guardians. That scene lightened the mopd for a bit and also gave that kind of entertainment you expect out of these characters.

Verdict: This film satisfied the Marvel fan in me. I walked out of this film with a lot of questions about what will happen next and I can't just wait for the next instalment arriving next year.

I am going with a 9/10.",9
Brilliant culmination for 10 years of MCU,25 April 2018,"After 10 years of amazing movies, the Russo Brothers have managed to create a brilliant continuity to the stories and link them into 1. With amazing production and CG that rivals any I've seen before, I was taken into this universe and was part of every charachter's thoughts even the evil Thanos. Well played by all, well produced by Marvel, this movie is a definite must watch, Josh Brolin made me forget he was CG. Cannot wait for next year's installment",10

Best movie ever,2 August 2018,,10
Bigger and different than any other movie,2 August 2018,"Infinity War is the nineteenth movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, so it makes sense people expect nothing else than the same characters fighting and joking. However, this movie is so much more than that. This isn't just a typical Marvel movie. This movie brings together 23 superheroes and concludes 18 previous installments to lead to the ultimate climax: a battle with the greatest and strongest villain of all time, Thanos (who raises in my opinion to the same height as iconic villains like Darth Vader or Voldemort). Thanos is more than a villain: he is a titan with the sole purpose of making the world a better place, only in the complete wrong way. Josh Brolin delivers an astonishing performance of this character and puts more to him than just a baddy, and makes him to someone who actually cares. As for the superheroes, Joe and Anthony Russo perfectly managed to give every single one of them a moment to shine. Special credits go to Robert Downey Jr, Benedict Cumberbatch, Zoe Saldana, Elizabeth Olsen, Chris Hemsworth and Paul Bettany. The movie gives us not only a ton of humor, but also some memorable though heartbreaking scenes which puts a different tone to the film than all the others. There is a strong build up with some spectacular action sequences (where the heroes are divided into smaller groups so that every person has his time to shine), and the film ultimately leads to an epic and amazing climax with an unexpected ending. Well done Marvel.",10

COLOSSAL. MONUMENTAL. EPIC!,25 April 2018,"It's COLOSSAL. MONUMENTAL. EPIC! Indeed the biggest Hollywood movie of 2018. It's an EXPERIENCE. Avengers: Infinity War gathers Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Captain America (Chris Evans), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman), Star Lord (Chris Pratt), Spider-man (Tom Holland), Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) and the rest of the Avengers together & unite in order to battle their most powerful enemy yet: the evil Thanos (Josh Brolin). On a mission to collect all six Infinity Stones, Thanos plans to use the artifacts to inflict his twisted will on reality. The fate of the planet and existence itself has never been more uncertain as everything the Avengers have fought for has led up to this moment.The hype that surrounds the movie is real. You haven't seen a film that puts together 19 of the biggest stars in Hollywood in one mega extravaganza. It's 2 hours & 29 minutes of big cinematic moments after another, with all possible elements of filmmaking combined together to make one gigantic film. You get your fill of action, comedy, suspense & a pinch of touching scenes in between. Like any film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, you also get your fill of fantastic visuals, top notch editing & great cinematography from Trent Opaloch. Alan Silvestri, fresh from the success of Ready Player One, delivers another memorable musical score.Directors Joe & Anthony Russo gives us not only an unforgettable superhero film, but the biggest film of their lives. They also directed one of my favorite films in the MCU (Captain America: Civil War) so rest assured that this movie is in totally good hands. I was literally shookt when the film ended, was not able to stand up even after the end credit scene was shown because I still needed to process what just happened in the whole film. It's that good!

How can Marvel top this???,27 April 2018,"This film is simply stunning, all the hype and antisipation do not do it justice.

From the start it's all go and the first 10mins of the film ensure you go through a few emotions, Thanos is here.

The story of how a group of superheros need to put differences aside to deal with the real end of world threat of Thanos is told to perfection, and how it all comes together is done in a way that now Marvel has a big problem!!

How can Marvel top this non stop rollercoaster of torn emotions??

I'm trying my best to not write a spoiler here so my review is short and sweet. People have said the run time is too long and these folk are stupid as there are so many questions coming out of this film and believe me when I tell you, As soon as the film starts time goes by and you will leave the cinema not realising you just spend over 2hrs in their.

This is the best film Marvel has done and will be impossible to top it",10

"Crackling dialogue, great fun.",29 April 2018,"Avengers: Infinity War: Great opening sequence with Thanos and his children/minions attacking The Asgardian starship. Loki stays on the Light Side and tries to kill Thanos but is apparently slain himself. Thor is battered and bewildered while the Hulk escapes to Earth and arrives as Banner crashing into Dr Strange's HQ.. Strange rounds up Ironman as the minions of Thanos arrive on Earth. Banner Can't change back into The Hulk, only succeeding in getting green around the gills.The guardians of the Galaxy rescue Thor who then heads off with Rocket and Gruit.

Space battle scenes, a Giant Dwarf forging a battleaxe.for Thor, ground battles in Africa, the Creation Myth for Gamora.. Vision and Scarlet Witch are outside a takeaway which serves deep fried kebabs when they are attacked by the children Of Thanos, possibly saving them from an even worse fate. We even get to see how Thanos got his start.

Crackling dialogue, wisecracking from Ironman and smartaleckery by rocket are counterposed to Thor's solipsistic godliness. The Guardians are successfully assimilated into the Avengers storyline as is Dr Strange. Maybe a confusion of characters at times but great fun. 8/10.",8

While this movie is not perfect, It was indeed a very well made movie, with the actors doing a top notch job as can be expected from the marvel cast. The story was very good and kept me engaged, and finally answered the question of why Thanos wanted all these shiny stones. Also I felt some sad emotions with some of the events, but I will not describe them as to not spoil the movie.",9
"Awesome, Brilliant, Epic",27 April 2018,Avengers : Infinity war is a movie which not just lived up but surpassed all the expectations. Its an intense movie with many fight sequence but also has its moments of fun. GOG Scenes with Thor add Iron man were the ones which will make anyone smile. even though the los our super heroes has gone through in the entire movie. There is not a single scene in movie which feels extra or unnecessary. All the actors have played their characters perfectly. Even we get to see the different aspects of Thanos personality and its just awesome.,10

Shallow but enthralling,26 April 2018,Avengers infinity war was one of the most enjoyable experiences I've had In a marvel movie the movie succeeds on entertainment value alone and the ending had me frozen in my seat. Unfortunately it's suffers from some poor character development except for with thanos who shines through as one of my favourite marvel villains. All the set pieces are memorable and more than up to standard as expected and we do get a lot of plot which is good because the lead up meant a lot needed to happen and it definitely delivered. Another great aspect was the sense of desperation that was a strong theme throughout the movie and it held a constant sense of tension during the whole runtime and did not hold back in what it did to some characters,8
THANOS Rules!!,28 April 2018,"Freaking amazing!!! I still can't gasp what I just saw...it was effectively moving & superbly action-packed that comes with a jaw dropping ending which may going to disappoint some moviegoers but I'm sure it'd really make sense to the true comicbook fans. Kudos to the MCU team for making it so bold & masterfully crafted. Some may find lack of concentration or character development for some of their favorite characters but as a whole it didn't bother me much, cause you can't expect each & every character of MCU to shine in their own way of glory in one single movie. Moreover, there's the sequel coming next year and that's where many possibilities lies, even changing the course of its reality! Btw, THANOS RULES!!! Awesome character building & surely going to be one of the best superhero movie villains of all time.",9

The best movie ever!,10 August 2018,There's nothing to add. You just can't take your eyes off the screen.,10
For all Marvel fans,30 April 2018,"Thanos(voiced by Josh Brolin) is searching for the Infinity Stones for his Gauntlet that could bring such incredible power for him, and he will stop at nothing to get it. And all the Avengers will have to come up with a plan to stop him, but will they before it's too late?





This film is what Marvel fans have been waiting for, most all the characters from the marvel universe in one film is a big treat, and the Thanos character is very menacing, and there toughest opponent, but I like the way he was portrayed has not just a one noted character, and CGI did not look fake. Everybody who has a little story of there own here, and they all play there parts well, you really invested in there plots. Action scenes are quite well shot. Keeps me with excitement for what new Marvel project coming next.",10
A+ Comic Book Movie,10 August 2018,,8
The most ambitious crossover in history of filmmaking indeed,17 May 2018,"Everything was almost perfect. The cast, the villain, the fight sequences, it all happened like a dream. The humour was good too. The ending was not only touching but also kept me craving for the second part of the movie.",10
Better than the Hype,11 January 2019,It wull blow your mind and break your heart. Not the usual superhero movie and cant wait for the second. Definitely recommend!,10
Hey yall prepare yourself for the Rubberband man,27 April 2018,"You've never heard a sound like the Rubberband man

You're bound to lose control when the Rubberband starts to jam

From the first moment Thanos appears on screen, the movie starts an emotional rollercoaster. With so many great characters there was bound to be great humor, but the Russos made a great coherent film with great story, visuals and drama.

I love Infinity War, because of the great messages it brings across about friendship, setting aside differences, sacrifice, love and overpopulation. Prepare yourself for Thanos, because there hasn't been anyone like him, cause you're bound to lose control when he gets to use the Infinity Gauntlet.",10
Best movie of all time.,1 August 2018,,10
Wash rinse and repeat,19 October 2018,This movie sucked bad just like all Marvel it's a same thing over and over there was a couple good Marvel movies,1
the best MARVEL !!!,7 July 2018,"If you are a fan of marvel movies THIS is the last LEVEL !
For the people who give a negative review . i ask you this : why do you criticize this type of movies if is not your favorite style ! go to other types such as drama ;comedies, trillers or others. do not enter ! is not for you !!",10
Epic proportions and Nerdgasmastic!,2 August 2018,"This movie is epic in all definitions. 19 movies to add up to this and it could not have been better. I was slightly skeptical a couple of years back, but after the last couple of Marvel movies (Doctor Strange, Black Panther and Thor Ragnorok) I had high hopes, and they were most def met!!! This movie makes the inner comic book nerd child in me drool in amazement!",10
Marvel best movie yet,1 May 2018,"Avengers Infinity War was far from the best movie ever made but is a pretty great, the visual effects were beyond amazing, the character interactions were great, the performances are wonderful, and then their is Thanos who is by far an amazing villain, one of the best villains ever and the best Marvel villain, surprisingly the story was well done, and the 3rd act is where the meat and potatoes are, not going to spoil anything but it's not like any of the other Marvel movies. And by That right there, You get the best Marvel movie.",10
An excellent movie from the Marvel stable,1 August 2018,"It's been hyped as good and surprisingly it actually lives up to it.

Marvel have brought many stories and characters together into this film to provide a VERY entertaining romp.

It's hugely dependent on the action and CGI and thankfully these are superbly handled as befits its astonishingly high budget. Although Spiderman in his first few swings still isn't quite right. Luckily, just like the last Spiderman movie it sorts itself out (is this an in-joke?).

A nice simple story with a decent number of cracking one-liners built into a very adept script, allows the action to proceed with aplomb into its numerous excellent set-pieces.

Great fun. More please!",10
Avengers,8 June 2018,Avengers Infinity War is bigger and better then any other movie.,10
BEST MOVIE IN HISTORY,1 May 2018,"Best movie ever seen in my life , ohhh baby what an outstanding STORYLINE, CGI , ACTING ,, everything in this movie is THE BEST ,, the movie will definitely make cry if you are a REAL MARVEL FAN , this movie is very very deferent than other avenger movies, i'd give it more than 10/10 if I could ""IT WILL BLOW YOUR MIND DEFINITELY""",10
Awesome,26 April 2018,Awesome movie of the year. The opening until the end is FIGHT!!,10
"Pointless, probably the worst movie of the franchise",2 August 2018,"Explosions, eplosions and more explosions and then it ends in drama, that you don't care At All, because the characters are given so little time and so few lines, it's shamefull. No, wait. It's actually shameless treating storytelling like that. Why did they spend all this money on this hopeless scipt? I was bored so much, I left mid-movie, went to get something to eat and got back. And I didn't really miss anything. Countless plot holes, nonsensical vilain and the heroes doing constantly things contrary to their character and abilities. And don't anybody dare say these are character arcs, because they are not. If nothing else, they start from the very first scene. Usually I'm patient with superhero movies. They are supposed to be light and fun, so many sins are forgiven without second thought. I'm sorry, this was unforgivable.And not fun. At All.",3
Great Film,10 May 2018,"It was a great film, I watched it in one breathe, the ending was a surprise, but that was the meaning and it told that that's not the end!!!! By the way it was very interesting!!!!",9
WOW,27 April 2018,The movie is amazing!! It's is hilarious at parts. It is super sad at others. They did a good job incorporating all of the characters. Best MCU movie to date!! Left me speechless at the end!!,10
10 Years in the making,26 April 2018,"I cannot contain my excitement! This film is the very best the MCU has to offer. It gives you a lot of thrills and shocks from the get go. All the cast members were incredible especially Brolin himself. His take on the mad titan is so daunting yet so relatable. (Not the best father figure) but you can see the time and effort which has gone into the character. Also he is an absolute beast!!! (Like Barney the dinosaur on roids) the storyline is captivating and for such a massive ensemble of all star actors, the film delivers and keeps the viewer interested and does not feel to overpowering and overcrowded at any time. The cast work so well together from the very serious scenes to the comedic timing of other scenes. a blend of drama and action really set the tone on why MCU is destroying DC films at the moment. Great watch 10/10",10
AMAZING AND PERFECT,21 June 2018,,10
Awesome film,16 May 2018,I was so looking forward to this film and it did not disappoint. Epic action scenes and just the right amount of humour. I enjoy the references to the other Marvel films and I would say this is my second favourite (after Thor Ragnarok). Can not wait for the second and make sure you stat til after the end credits finish,9
Haters gonna hate... but this is a cult movie.,13 May 2018,A movie that's gonna be remembered for many decades to come. Epic movie. Why are all the ONE STAR reviews most helpful? Are you kidding me? 10/10,10
I had many worries - but it turned out to be my favorite Avengers movie,25 April 2018,"This is the movie we've been waiting for. The big villain, the big story, almost all of our heroes working together. In the last ten years, all MCU movies built up to this moment. And we're not just seeing the big heroes, but also their sidekicks. This isn't just another Avengers movie, this is Avengers³.

I was really worried. These were the questions on my mind : 1. Would it all work out? 2. Would all the different movie styles mesh together? 3. Would it make for a coherent, satisfying story? 4. Could enough characters get their own moments? 5. Would the movie dare to try enough new things? 6. Now that they cut the story in half, would the movie have a satisfying ending? 7. Would I want to watch this movie again and again? Would it be a great movie that I'd want to watch many times?

The answer to all questions is: Yes.

1. It all works out and makes for a great and epic movie. It's fast, it's exciting, it's funny, it's scary, it's dramatic. Marvel has not forgotten how to make movies.

2. The styles blend in flawlessly. Because the story takes place in different places, not all characters meet, so that definitely helps. And when they do, they are suitably introduced to each other. It never felt weird; if anything, it set up for some hilarious jokes.

3. The story is fast and feels like it could be spread out a bit more, but there's a lot of depth here. Thanos makes for a better villain than I dared to hope.

4. There are several great character stories here. A few sidekick characters only do some fighting and hardly get any lines, but most characters definitely get their awesome moments. The character interaction always feels very good.

5. The movie really dares to go where others did not. Not just in scale but also in drama; this is probably the most dramatic MCU movie to date.

6. Don't worry, the movie doesn't stop halfway the story. There's cliffhanger, sure. You'll be dying to see the sequel, sure. People will complain about the ending, sure. But it all works out. Next year, we can organize some great 5 hour's marathons.

7. There is so much to see and enjoy in this movie, I'll be watching it again and again. I daresay this is the most enjoyable Avengers movie to date.",9
Didn't like it,3 September 2018,"I can't understand why you guys liked this movie, it's just superhero turmoil. Just can be watch to waste spare time. I must admit that movie's graphics are awesome but movie isn't made up just with graphics.",1
Best. Movie. Ever.,18 May 2018,"As far as superhero movies go, even if you have never seen the other movies, this is by far the greatest comic book movie ever done! It has everything, from action to drama to comedy to tragedy. If you want to truly be entertained, then GO SEE THIS MOVIE!",10
Beautiful,14 May 2018,"The movie was very nice the build up was amazing I mean 19 movies to make this movie most characters got a fair screen time except thanos of course but every character you know their back story you feel like you know them and you can't judge this movie alone because it's a two parts , to have all this story in just one part is very beautiful , this is my favorite super hero movie so far , most people who like DC more than marvel will say the movie is bad because this is not their team but just watch the movie and forget about DC or any other super hero movie and you will see it's a good one and for maximum enjoyment of this movie I prefer watching the movies before this that lead to this big movie. Also if you don't like super heros at all or if your very old you might not like this movie other wise you will love it just keep an open mind and try to blend in.",9
"This film will take you for a ride, pull at your heart strings and yet you will be coming back for more.",2 May 2018,"Marvel have proven time and time again that they know what the fans want and they know what the fans need and this time they not only pulled off such an audacious film but perhaps the most star and risk filled film to date.

With such a ride from start to finish, a perfect balance between action and narrative story telling, Infinity War knows when to suck you in, pull back a little and then knock you down begging for more.",10
"Watched it 3 times already in XD, Dolby and....IMAX!",23 May 2018,"This movie is a cash cow for a good reason...it is an exciting first of a two part conclusion to the build up of Marvel super heroes over the past decade, beginning with Iron Man, leading the fight to Thanos's realm. I watched it in Cinemark XD which was a let down, then second time in Dolby AMC and finally in AMC IMAX. The IMAX experience was the best and I can't wait to own an Infinity War bluray to add to my collection. Furthermore, this movie is a great conversation starter with family members and friends to discuss what happens next. The visuals are stunning, the sound is fantastic and the standout characters were Thanos and Thor. This movie is approaching 2 billion dollar mark and hopefully it should reach it, because it is worth your money spent. I highly suggest IMAX, it was awesome. Looking forward to the second part in 2019!",10
Greatest movie Marvel has ever done....,10 May 2018,,10
The Ten Year Wait Was Worth It,17 May 2018,"The MCU has been my favorite since I watched the first Captain America in elementary school. Every single film felt like it was leading to something bigger, and this was it and it delivered better than I ever could have imagined. Stephen McFeely and Christopher Markus once again do a fantastic job with the screen play. I was amazed at how well they were able to balance every single character. Most characters don't have more than 10 minutes of screen time but everyone has a moment to shine, their presence feels much bigger. I really think credit is deserved for Thanos, everything about him. Josh Brolin does fantastic in this role; he is the best villain in a superhero film since the 2008 Joker. The CGI on him was also flawless. The visual and sound effects were superb in general. I was a bit worried about that after Black Panther which had mediocre CG, but this film looked excellent. This movie is paced in a way that provides exciting action throughout and offers a chance for the big characters to have deep moments, particularly with Star-Lord. If you haven't seen this, you need to, it is nothing short of spectacular.",10

Very entertaining,25 April 2018,"So balance... funny, heroic, sad, thrilling, mysterious, savage all in one screen. Can't wait to see the next chapter",9
Great film,2 May 2018,"Best MCU film yet. Brolin in his role of Thanos was great. Very intense throughtout, the story was brilliant , most MCU fans would be disappointed with the ending but this wasn't a film focusing on the hero's for once.",10
"Amazing , The Russo Brothers nailed it, hand down from me",21 June 2018,"Some of scene make me shock some scene make me imotional too. Thanos is the best villain I've ever seen. He not just normal villain to kill bunch of people because he love but his motivation so clear why he wanna do that and most people know he is collecting all the infinity stones.

One of the best part of it the team up Guardian & Avengers just amazing, full of humor cannot stop laughing watching their scene together.

If You are a MARVEL fan Or If You Are a Superhero Fan Definetely Yo Will Like It.But You Need to Watch Previous Marvel Movies.",10
To Infinity And Beyond,21 June 2018,"Marvel Studios has over the years come under criticism for its lack of great villains in their movies. I'm not sure I totally agree with that assessment as I always thought Loki was pretty good, and Michael Keaton's Vulture in Spider-Man: Homecoming I really liked, I have to say. The Winter Soldier was another great one I reckon, as was the Red Skull. But I guess I can see where people are coming from with regards to some.

Thanos however, more than makes up for any villainous shortcomings in the MCU. He wields awesome power with his nefarious intentions, but Marvel also manage to give him an incredible depth and intriguing method to his madness in this latest confluence of superheroes from all over the universe.

We've known Thanos has been coming big time for a number of movies now and in this latest blockbuster he arrives with a bang. Or maybe more with a click of the fingers. Anybody who knows anything about the mad Titan and his skullduggerous designs on the universe in the comic books knows that that is pretty much all he has to do to achieve massive genocide on a galactic scale once he gets all six of the Infinity Gems in his gauntlet.

Can Earth's Mightiest Heroes the Avengers, as well as a number of others and Galaxy Guardians stop him?

Well, like many others over the record-breaking opening weekend, you will have to go and see the movie to find out. Of course, the movie technically comes in two parts even though the second instalment is not going to be 'Infinity War part two' as originally announced, but rather named something else. A title that was apparently held back because it might have spoiled certain aspects of this movie.

It's never going to be easy incorporating so many different characters into one film - many of which who are pretty big in the comic book and movie world already - but following previous success with The Winter Soldier and Civil War, the Russo brothers pull this off again to great effect.

This movie does jump around the universe a lot from scene-to-scene, but has a very interesting ending indeed. And for god's sake, unlike many others who still appear to not have cracked the code yet, make sure you stay for the post-credits scene. Because if you know anything about any of the characters in the spacey world of (Captain) Marvel, the next couple of movies in the on-going saga are going to be a real treat.

Make mine Marvel!",9

A great movie !,15 May 2018,"There is a lot of negative reviews here and I don't understand why, the movie is what it is entertainment and a lot of actions and that is exactly what I expected,,when I go see a movie of this type I am not expecting a academy award performance but instead a great action movie and that is exactly what I got !",8
Emotional and breathtaking,14 May 2018,"Avengers infinity war is a must see for any marvel fan like myself seeing our greatest heroes come together like the guardians of the galaxy, spider man and many more but the highlight of the movie is Josh Brolins thanos easily the best baddie since darth Vader. I cant stress it enough just see it for yourself",9
THE BEST!,2 May 2018,"Travelling by bus for a total of 800 plus kilometers just to watch it in IMAX is all worth it. I haven't read the comics but I'm really into the movie. The visual effects are superb! The story line is not dragging. The movie is like a puzzle, that was perfectly fit by the Russo Brothers! The fun is there, but it's so brutally dark that left us speechless.",10
WHAT!!!!!!,31 July 2018,Don't understand the negative comments. The film was solid. Lived up to the hype.,10
Exceeded my expectation,2 May 2018,"There was balance between explosions and quietness. I was sceptic, I thought I would get empty feeling like what usually I got after watching summer blockbuster movies. This movie is different, I felt lots of emotion afterward :)",10
An Honest Review,29 April 2018,"I walked into this frightened that there would be too man characters and the result would be an empty vacant shell of a movie that was pulled in so many different directions it couldn't make sense of itself.

Yay, I was wrong.

Seriously, they did a good enough job. They focused on Gomorrah, Thor, and Strange and Stark enough to make a plot despite the insane amount of characters. And the rest they used as filler, with only the Vision story coming up a bit light due to population.

And the Vision story was a bit of a draw back. It was there but it wasn't, but at least it was there, it was important, but it seemed tertiary and a little too much so.

The Humor was also scaled back. But Spider Man did a good job, Cap had a few and laughs,and yet again, it was only Panther and the Wakandans that took themselves too seriously to be in a Marvel movie.

I'm sorry, someone really needs to tell the MCU that it is fine if the Black Panther cracks a smile or a one-line once or twice. We won't mind.

The tone was more action than action/comedy...but with ""War"" in the title, you kind of expect that.

However, they do NOT even address the elephant in the room...why did Widow go blond? Was it to have more fun or was it simply because she was on the run. The world may never know.

What we do know is that we missed Hawkeye, even if he is on and off again retired. And we missed Ant-Man, but given how many people were here, the absences were noted but not really noticed.",10
My first review in life time!,10 May 2018,"This is my first review, or you say I've to give my review. This movie makes an impact on you that will last for some time. After a very long time, something extra-ordinary to watch. I really felt the fear of Thanos that means how perfectly this character is developed. Excellent Stuff and a Must Watch!",10

Flawless Masterpiece,6 August 2018,Great story telling amazing visual effects The best comicbook movie ever made Even better than the dark knight,10
I don't know how they did it but they did!!,8 July 2018,"I'm a marvel fan, have been since day 1 and I can conclude that this film was simply the best it could have been! Every element you could think of, the cast the acting the CGI, cinematography, editing, it's all extraordinary in this movie to the point that marvel fans are most likely ecstatic about like I am! Everything we were hoping for and more was in this movie. Best MCU movie!!

P.S Thanos is by far the best comic book movie villain of all time exceeding that of Heath Ledgers joker which I never thought would be possible but I'm anyone can do the impossible in cinema it's Marvel!",10

Badest movie ever!,20 August 2018,Story is scandalous. Too much heroes... you know what I mean. It really hurts during watching.,1
Great.,2 May 2018,,10
DC take note please,28 April 2018,Before Infinity War for me Thanos is just another genetic looking villian for me so i don't know how much this movie do the him justice but what i do know is he slowly becoming my favorite villiant of the MCU.Infinity War is depressing as hell everytime the heroes get a tiny bit of chance Thanos crush it into dust with his ultra OP weapon The Infinity Gautlet.His ideals of bringing balance to the universe is so wrong on many levels but the fact that he believe that is the only way is what make Thanos so scary and interesting.For more than 10 years the long string successful of the MCU still continue with Infinity War so let see how much they can offer us in another 10 years.(P/S.The best dark storyline of Marvel so far is still Logan btw),9
Amazing! Amazing,22 May 2018,Amazing film when I first heard there were going to be 60 characters I thought it would be very packed but I was wrong this movie found a way to make all 60 characters have a good part that wasn't to confusing and not hard to follow!,10
Infinity War is an epic that every MCU fan deserves,28 April 2018,"Hands down Thanos is the best CGI villain ever put to film. He's a compelling character and you can feel he's a real-life human (except he's not). Josh Brolin performance makes Thanos even more realistic and humane. His motion-capture performance adds up to the character of Thanos, and that's really unusual or maybe doesn't happen unless we had Andy Serkis. The CGI in general is very good.

Thanos has many great moving moments when he explains his motives, but despite how indirect and classy he illustrates his motivations, I hoped there were more ways to do so rather than using dialogue and nothing more. Also, I think there was no need for more explanations in the third act of the movie. C'mon, there is a final battle happens and Thanos still gives some reasons why he does that!

There's an incredible chemistry between almost all our heroes, and that enhanced the humor in this movie which, by the way, is splendid! Almost every joke hits the mark. The problem that there was a tonal shift between the first act and the second act that made a dramatic scene not as effective as it should have been, but it's really a very minor issue as it just happened one time.

The character development features all along the movie itself not just as a complement to the previous movies.

There are a lot of shocking moments and unflinching decisions that you have never seen in a Marvel movie.

I have never been confused by the story's developments or many events as all of them are represented simply. Actually even simpler than in some other MCU movies.

The Russo Brothers showed how much they understand every single character in the universe by changing the tone according to the characters and the place.

The Best Marvel Movie Yet.,18 May 2018,"When this movie was announced I was super hyped for it & after seeing it on opening day I will gladly say that this movie did not disappoint in the slightest, not only is this the best MCU movie but it's the best comic book movie period. Also without revealing too much I just wanna say that you should be sure to bring a box of tissues with you when you see it.",10

Worst Movie Ever,11 August 2018,"Let me start off by saying I am a SciFi/Fantasy Fan, I love it.. it expands the mind and usually lifts the soul. But this negative soul ripping ride into depression made me so angry that I called where I buy digital movies from and got my money back.. first time I've ever done that.. I understand this is part one of a multi part movie, but *explative* after a hard day I wanted to be 'entertained' not pulled into a depression.. negative from start to finish, nothing but bad feelings. Superhero's are supposed to give hope and you'll find NONE here. In this day and time we live in the entire point of watching a superhero movie to see what a super hero is supposed to do. This movie infuriated me because it did the opposite.. you blew it marvel.. not as mad since I got to see it for free, but angry enough that I won't ever give you a red cent of mine again so long as I live for doing that to me.. you failed me at a time when I wanted nothing but a little entertainment, if I want something depressing that looks like fantasy I just watch the news. Marvel you suck.",1
Don't believe the negativity!!,6 May 2018,,10
"Arguably, the most epic Marvel comic movie ever made.",29 April 2018,"The greatest asset of this action packed superhero saga is that not only it can stun you with many hair raising action and epic battle sequences but with the emotional grip that tones this fantastic film very well throughout the running time.. Even, with the highly unlikable villain 'Thanos' the directors have managed to create emotionally tender moments giving quite a bit of a wider scope to how the villain is portrayed in this epic Marvel gem. Each an every major marvel Superhero gets to pay his/her contribution in fighting against the almighty evil 'Thanos' with convincing and rich performances majorly because of the wonderful screenplay adapted by C. Markus and Stephen McFeely. The major sub plot turnouts and plot twist building up to the climax have been crafted so masterfully to create maximum impact on keeping the strong momentum in the flow of the plot. I must also admit that since the fantabulous and iconic Dark Knight trilogy by Christopher Nolan this is the next superhero movie in which I felt emotionally gripped with its storytelling and with amazing visual effects which in itself is a marvel to look at. Do not miss this epic saga by Russo brothers and regret it.",8
This was impressive...,31 July 2018,,9
All-time Fav!!!,18 May 2018,Great movie! Lots of fun. It is really fun for me to watch the marvel movies as I read a lot of the comics as a kid. It's innocent fun with relatable themes for anyone with any sense of empathy. I can't believe all the negativity but I guess it's a sign Marvel is doing something right.,10

"Anyone That Rated It Less Than 9, Is A Person Who Loves to Walk Against The Tide",14 May 2018,"Like I said, anyone who has rated this movie less than 9, has done it simply because they can't bring themselves to agree with the majority. Most of these are people with low self-esteem who have been at the receiving end of the world at large. Good to see, there are only a few such anyway. The movie is hands down the best movie ever created in the history of movies and that's it!",10
"Perfect: balance, continuity, everything",14 May 2018,,10
The whole movie is just a 2- hour fan service.,4 August 2018,"Have you ever watched a movie where even if you already set the speed to 1.3, you still can't stop yourself to forward it 5-20 seconds time to time? I just did. I even read positive reviews to convince myself that the film is good but nothing worked. Don't get me wrong. I know, and I am very much familiar with MCU. I liked it, in fact, even if the whole plot is cliche.

The whole movie is just a 2- hour fan service thus the lack of storytelling. But, of course, this would be not an issue for Marvel since the viewers watch the film only for the sake of seeing their favorite characters come to life (even with slight inaccuracies) and knowing (not figuring out because every Marvel film is shallow) what would happen at the end of the film. Thus, it is also the case that if the viewers already knew what will happen in the film, the film will lose its value. This is pretty simple. Every important part of this film is just a collection of discrete information. Watching this film felt like reading a bullet outline. There's no transition. No emotions to fill those gap--which something I believe a good movie should have. The supposed catharsis should have happened during the whole disintegration moment, like really? How cringey is that? This film is a mosaic. Most of the plot-turning moments in the film are unsubstantiated. I would bet even the Marvel fan themselves observed some moments in the film where they would react: how did that happen.

The script made the film into a clown fiesta. This film is more like a parody. A highly budgeted parody is a crap.",4
Best movie ever ... ignore trols and haters,19 May 2018,"Ok, first of all more and less everybody seen this movie so far - so i will refer to these negative comments here.

First of all time shouldn't allow everyone to add here review. I look most of this 1-3/10 accounts profile and there are mostly created in 2018 without any activity but negative on this movie. So there are trols and multy accounts of some group from DC extremists or general haters of everything. IMDb should ban this trols.

Second, for every SCFi fan, or Comic Fan, this is masterpiece of our time. Avengers on big screen and they are epic ... WTF do you want more? yes i want too ... that Justice Ligue is half good as this one but hey at least we have one good and one epic i 2 years :))

3rd this is not 'part movie', this is complete movie and it follows conquest of Thanos. He starts, he collects, he fights and he .... SPOILER ... the end, movie is over. They don't need to made any other Avengers nor any other movie to finish story.",10

This is Both What marvels fans have waited for 10 years and a chance for New Marvel fans to feel a part of it !,25 April 2018,"Okay so first of all i went to the cinema with high expactations with Both Marvel fans an non Marvel fans ! So first a was chocked by everything it was so much feelings for me as a Marvel fan and also nostalgic!

The other who where non Marvel fans was just sittning trough the film and didn't say anything ! Everyone was staying after the credit scene and after the cinema screen was closed everyone tough this movie was great !

everyone was Happy sad (just me)XD and just enjoyed the film and Said it was really good One of the best !



This is the biggest movie ever done and it's live upp to everything",10
Marvel's Best,15 May 2018,"From start to the last scene at the end of the credits, Avengers: Infinity War is a jaw dropping, action packed, adventure that will leave you craving more as the end credits start to run. Thanos is shown to be not only the biggest threat the Avengers has yet to face, but has also proven himself to be the best written and performed villain the MCU has had to date. This movie is a must see for any and every comic book fan out there and is highly recommended to those who are casual fans and sci-fi/adventure and comedy fans.",10
Perfect Start,2 May 2018,,10
Not what i expected,23 September 2018,"I was disappointed. Normally Marvel produces very great movies however this one was a flunk in my opinion, to much was jammed all at once into it and not only that there was just not enough detail to storyline such as previous Avenger movies.",2
Emotionally Shaken,25 April 2018,"If you understand MCU really well, have watched all the 18 movies before this one and all the TV series connected to the universe, you will emotionally shaken realize that the stakes are really high. The Russo Brothers are clearly understand what makes MCU works. Nearly everu character has their own shining moments, the team-up was FANTASTIC, and the call from the past was unbelievable. I still can't believe what I just watched.",10
The Greatest of All Time,28 April 2018,"I can't think of a movie experience as gratifying as this one. This movie was a complete universe in the making, an experiment that had every possibility of going wrong... but it... did... not!

The whole movie lasts about two and a half hours but you can barely feel it, the mere spectacle is so full of surprises mixed with a healthy dose of humor. Infinity War feels like an intergalactic battle with the higher stakes as The Avengers and their allies fight the biggest threat they will ever face, a god-like Mad Titan by the name of Thanos.

Every single film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe feels like a necessary piece of the puzzle as many of the questions we thought were forgotten will get a resolution.

The Russo Brothers did the best they possibly could and it feels almost as a reward of all our loyalty, this is the movie we deserved... and they gave it to us.

This was probably the best Comic Book adaptation of All-Time.",10
Greatest MCU movie yet!,25 April 2018,"Wow,just wow.

I was so thrilled going into the cinema, expecting great action, amazing visuals, funny jokes, and it delivered. This has to be the best marvel movie i have watched so far! IM STILL PUMPED I CANT SLEEP!",10

A MASTERPIECE!!!,25 April 2018,"Everything about this movie was so perfect and epic, it's what we had been waiting for many years! Just wow...what a ride of feels! I enjoyed every second and can't wait to see how it continues. So much fun humor, action scenes, music, lots of characters etc... The best villain. Also that ending omg.",10
For shame DC fanboys.,31 July 2018,"I thought this was a 9/10 but gave it 10 stars to counter the 1/10 from all the moronic DC fanboys. They're not even hiding it well either. Go read all the 1/10 reviews and see how many at some point make a remark about ""how bad it is and it's the sort of thing those marvel fans enjoy"" or similar. They slip up every time.

So blatantly obvious. Go back to your dire movies and maybe get out of your mother's basements once in a while.",10
...Is That It?,14 November 2018,,4
Thank You,8 August 2018,"I absolutely liked it. Superheroes especially Marvel I can only take in smaller doses, but when we get all those superheros in this film it is so Epic. On their own they can often drag out. DC Batman/Superman/Dredd however I am more inclined until they don't combine well, because they are stand alone, and any justice league seemingly only really stole from Marvel.

I admit this film is gonna be marmite to some, love/hate possibly due to continuity. But it's worth it unless they predictably Disney next. There should be a price. Look at our World. Otherwise I might stew. As far as the current trilogy so far, it's very hard for me too pick a winner between the first and the 3rd? The first started it and was a great film, the 3rd however you must watch and make that marmite opinion. Forget the second I didn't like it, many reasons, but that's a separate review. Infinity War certainly lives up too its hype, it is so fresh and enjoyable, they didn't look stupid like all stand around jacking each other off in those other superhero movies where they all do a line dance, singing like a bad music video. It had enough clever one-liners, comedy not too impact its telling, but enough humor for it to also be a hoot. And its visuals, choreography, and story are masterful.

Thank you for this addition. It was amazing, and a favorite.",9
Thanos the real hero.,11 May 2018,"This is a story about a being who wants to save the universe. Who sees the big picture and know's that no matter what the cost, be it family or fame, he will sacrifice all to save trillions. Some people call him the villian, but will he be remembered as a savour ? Are the Avengers putting their selfish needs ahead of the greater good, only time will tell.",10

Don't Hear These Hater Voices.,14 May 2018,"First of all i am not a Disney fanboy, i hated Star Wars 7 and 8 (6 and 3 on IMDB). Second i am not a Marvel fanboy, i didnt like Iron Man 3, Avengers 1, spiderman homecoming and i was upset about Black Panther. But its hard, to describe this one other than epic. These scenes, a perfect villian and the music guide you through a movie that is by far one of the best movies in the last 3 years. Yeah sure its not inception or interstellar but the movie doesnt want to be that kind of movie. Its high end action, best cgi i have seen so far and the best version of Cap, Thor etc. I have seen. Don't belive those haters, this is highly entertaining. I don't know anybody personal who has seen it and didnt love it. (Please excuse my english.)",10
The best Súper héroe movie.,15 May 2018,"Avengers Infinity War its more than good, its funny, exciting, sentimental and manages to find a balance when using its characters, thanos is a better villain of the MCU, and the truth revives by much my love for the genre of superheroes.",10
"Half audiences were gone by the end of the movie, must have left in the middle",25 May 2018,"By the end of the movie, half audiences were gone. Must found it boring and left in the middle :\ . . . . Oh wait a sec...",10
I see the DC fan boys are joining together to try and ruin this films rating....,31 July 2018,"Great balanced(excuse the pun, Thanos) film that worked with over 20 characters, which could over totally toppled over with too many characters. A good continuation of the marvel universe that took a lot of chances.

I can only imagine the people that are rating this as 1 star are the ones that are trying to stick up DCs sorry excuse for a franchise.

I'm not a Marvel fan boy but I have enjoyed every marvel film that has been released due to good script, good acting and a good plan for this franchise to carry on so far. Marvel/disney....bravo.",10

Best marvel film!!,2 May 2018,Film is amazing best one they have made yet so looking forward to part 2 this film definitely a 10/10 rating!,10
"Entertaining, fun, a feast to the eyes. Very well executed.",16 May 2018,"Marvel sure know what they are doing. The storyline is well-designed. VFX scenes are super satisfying. Lovable heroes. Intimidating villain. Very creative in every way. So many characters yet handled so well. It was a visual feast to the eyes. I saw it in IMAX3D and it was just perfect. There might be a few goofs during the movie but hey, all movies have some. It is such a pleasure to see the development of Marvel's universe and heroes. They evolve through out the films in a best way possible. Totally recommend the movie.",9
More Of An Event Than A Movie,15 May 2018,,9
The best Marvel movie!!!,16 May 2018,Truly Avengers Infinity War it's the best Marvel movie.It lived its hype and it was a big shock for all the fans.Fantastic but sad too. This movie is different than any kind of superhero movie and it had a lot of twists.The action and the acting was perfect and evey scene of the film was exciting.I recommend it to everyone because even if you're not a regular watcher of Marvel you will like this movie.,10
masterpiece,15 May 2018,The recast so genius this movie movie genius unpredictable bla bla bla,10
MARVEL PEAKED !!!,16 May 2018,"Best Marvel cinematic universe movie ever !! With such a big cast .. and so much build up ... hype .. everyone expected the movie to disappoint . For me it didnt . It succeeded in all aspects . The action and cgi was better than in any other marvel movie before. the best villian in a marvel movie . the movie itself was emotional , let room to grow for some characters ..even tho i mean thanos especially cuz it was kind his movie ... but also gamora .. thor ... ironman .. had character moments. Black Panther was a good movie for the first 30-60 mins but became shallow really quick.. it was more of a bad written and bad directed James Bond Marvel version to me, even tho the acting was pretty good.. but Infinity War felt like a true Marvel movie..",10

An Honest Review,29 April 2018,"I walked into this frightened that there would be too man characters a the result would be an empty vacant shell of a movie that was pulled in so many different directions ti couldn't make sense of itself.

Yay, I was wrong.

Seriously, they did a good enough job. They focused on Gomorrah, Thor, and Strange and Stark enough to make a plot despite the insane amount of characters. And they rest they used as filler, with only the Vision story coming up a bit light due to population.

And the Vision story was a bit of a draw back. It was there but it wasn't, at least it was there, it was important, but it seemed tertiary and a little too so.

The Humor was also scaled back. But Spider Man did a good job, Cap had a few and, again, it was only Panther and the Wakandans that took themselves too seriously to be in a Marvel movie....again.

I'm sorry, someone really needs to tell the MCU that it is find if the Black Panther cracks a smile or a one-line once or twice. We won't mind.

The tone was more action than action/comedy...but with ""War"" in the title, you kind of expect that.

However, they do NOT even address the elephant in the room...why did Widow go blond? Was it to have more fun or was it simply because she was on the run. The world may never know.

What we do know is that we missed Hawkeye, even if he is on and off again retired. And we missed Ant-Man, but given how many people were here, the absences were noted but not really noticed.",10
"An ambitious, decade long project culminates with a film that lives up to the hype.",2 May 2018,"The only flaw I could find in this film is that it's best moments could be lost on the more casual fans of the MCU. Infinity War certainly rewards those who have spent years following the over-arcing story through the decade of 18 films. That said, Infinity War probably doesn't create many ""new"" fans, with the exception of those willing to watch the back catalogue.

For those who have followed the MCU, Infinity War more than lives up to the anticipation and buildup of Thanos throughout the years. The stakes were not only high for the heroes in this film, but for the creative team who had to deliver on the work of countless others over the years. Infinity War May be the best summer popcorn flick I've ever seen! Ridiculously exciting, excruciatingly suspenseful, emotional and awe inspiring. The acting is great, the humor is on point and the villain Thanos is more than we could've hoped for. The CGI and effects were next level and I left the theater dying to see the next installment, as well as another viewing of Infinity War. I left with that feeling if stepping off a roller coaster and wanting to ride it again immediately!",10

"Epic and unforgettable, a genre mastepiece and a milestone",2 May 2018,"Russo's brothers warned us that would have been an unforgettable movie, but neither in my best dreams i could expect something like that. The characters are perfectly managed, lots subplots that risked of weight down add something new, and their characterization gives me goosebumps beacuse of his consistency. See the characters we love interact between them is as funny as serious, because of Thanos's imminent threat, wich here is simply monstrous. One of Marvel's biggest problems has always been the villain, often too flat and stereotypical, Thanos instead it's all the opposite and He gives us a memorable villain, with which you empathize and that behind the Motion Capture hides a heart and a soul. From a technical point of view the film reaches roofs never topped, with breathtaking visual effects and a fast and frenetic direction, which in the fightins gives the best of itself. While not having a dark stile, the film proposes mature and tragic's themes, answering a lots of questions but leaving us with many questions marks wich will presumably be unveiled in the next chapter. My only issue is in my opinion the hurry with which the final battle was managed, although this defect is blown away by the end. Russo's brothers have been able to do what 10 years ago(release of the first Marvel movie) seemed impossible and they did it dosing everything perfectly, everyone has his role to play within the story. Nobody is indispensable, but everyone is necessary to face a threath wich concerns them closely and that risks to undermine everything they care about. Humour is not exaggerated, but on the contrary, it contrasts very well with the dark's themes, and Guardians of the Galaxy fit perfectly. Like it or not, Avengers Infinity War is destined to enter in the history of cinema, for social and economic importance, it's the culmination, the apotheosis of 10 years of hard work, and It won't be Pulp Fiction or Citizen Kane but is a genre mastepiece. On conclusion Avengers Infinity War is destined to become iconic, it's epic, unforgettable, exciting and courageous and despite some little defects it's going to be one of the best entertaining movie ever made, if not the best. Score: 94%",9
Malade !!!!!,15 May 2018,"Malade .... j'ai adoré, il y a de l'action dès les premières minutes. J'ai adoré et j'ai déjà hâte a la suite",10
Just a little bit better than Justice League,8 August 2018,"Compared to Justice League's Steppenwolf, the main villian is a bit more fleshed out. What doesn't help is, that his motivation and plan are super dumb if you think about it. The execution also doesn't make much sense.

The story is full of cliches and non-sensical plans and most dead people surely will return soon again. This movie is 90% CG, some of it very bad and I could believe of even the soulless script was computer-generated",3
Oooooosssshhhhhhh,16 May 2018,Did not disappoint. What a brilliant start to part one of two. I found my self leaning to team thanos we defo see a side to him finally after 20 movies that have been building up to this. He's not the crazed lunatic he is made out to be he's a realist anyway hope u guys enjoy,9
Epic movie,16 May 2018,Personally I thought it was excellent. I wasn't expecting Oscar performances or deep plot just an enjoyable action film showing just how tough Thanos really is and this doesn't disappoint. There was alot of story to cover even in over 2.5 hours of film but thought it was done very well. Can't wait for next film.,10
Damn!,11 May 2018,"That was the best and most magnificent MCU movie I have ever seen. Bumps up to my top ten films of all time. Just right behind Logan, Avengers: Infinity war did what the justice league never could. Pull people into the story. I felt like I was there fighting side by side with Iron-man and Cap. Not once did I stare at the stupid screen in my pocket. Not once did my eyes get droopy from weariness. Not once did I go, 'they could've done that better.' Emotional, funny, action packed, perfect writing, and entertaing as all get out. Simply superb. 10/10",10
Best movie I have seen,25 April 2018,"To me it is the best movie I have seen till now. It has emotion, jokes, seriousness, everything in it. Infinity War portrayals Thanos very well. He seems almost human. So it is a amazing movie, a must see",10

Need more girl power,27 April 2018,So tired of women playing 2nd fiddle and weaker parts in the Marvel universe.

WOW,20 May 2018,"This movie will leave you floored. Marvel means business now. This movie brings together all of your favourite superheroes and weaves them into a desperate and complex narrative which surprisingly doesn't feel strained. The Russo brothers have done it again, they made a film that brings together all of these icons yet still tells a complete, well-defined story. This film has great humour but is mainly a darker film. The situation is tense and there is a strong feeling of hopelessness. Thanos is a very strong, compelling, almost sympathetic yet ruthless villlain unlike any the Avengers have faced before. Bring your tissues people because this movie pulls no punches. The film takes all sorts of risks and there are moments that are truly heartbreaking. YOU NEED TO EXPERIENCE THIS AS SOON AS HUMANLY POSSIBLE! Fantastic movie that surprised me after 18 Marvel movies of the same.",10
I was gripped throughout,3 May 2019,"I should start by saying I've only given 10/10 to two other movies, that's how rarely I give them. This has all the elements of a great movie, I couldn't ask for more. It took me through various different emotions; and it kept me excited and on the edge of my seat. I couldn't wait for what would happen next.. and it never ended.. The action just kept coming. The movie made me feel like I was part of the avengers, and as if I was being carried along this enjoyable, exciting journey; and I found myself cheering for them. I just loved it.",10
Review of Avengers: Infinity War,14 March 2019,,9
"Fails to justify the hype, but a commendable effort.",28 April 2018,"Marvel's most ambitious title yet revels in it's frequently remarkable computer generated imagery. From the piercingly realistic Thanos to the glorious depiction of otherworldly planets, it's difficult not to succumb to awe and wonder. Additionally, the action sequences here are earnestly more successful than in the scandalously overrated Black Panther.

However, it may be argued that the narrative's dark tone comes into conflict with the protagonists' humorous dialogue, dampening the atmosphere.

Despite the positive reception to major antagonist Thanos, his depth amounts to little more than a somewhat contrived origin story.",8
Expectations met but not exceeded,28 April 2018,,9
Where's Joss Whedon on this?,1 August 2018,"This movie lacks the magical Joss Whedon touch. The witty repartee just wasn't there. Thanos was supposed to be an ambivalent ""monster"", but seemed too melancholy and uncommitted to his choices. Joss is the master of bipolar multiple personality disorder villians and hero's alike. Some of the characters just weren't selling it.",5

Above and beyond all the superheroes movies or perhaps any actions movies before with emotional, spirits, cosmic scale of suspense and wonderfully combined with humours, love and team work.

Best Marvel movie thus far.",10
"Blows, but not your mind",30 September 2018,"This movie is so boring I had to watch it in installments. Some folks say it blows your mind but I just think it blows. I probably over-rated it as a 4 but mostly because of the special effects. Weak plot, too much jumping around, WAY too long. Even the battle scenes drug on much too long. Thinning the herd may have been the best end solution for the movie. Too bad it didn't happen in the first 30-45 minutes. I was ready to dissolve into ashes by the time the credits were ready to roll. I think the people that loved this movie beyond compare are the same folks that would wait in line for 2-3 days for the release of the new iPhone.",4
One of the BEST super hero movies ever made. period.,30 April 2018,,10
Outstandingly Depressing,28 April 2018,,9
Death follows him like a shadow,28 April 2018,"Avengers Imfinity War is one of best and strongest Marvel films to date. I've been waiting for this for about 5 years since I heard it was being made, and I can now say I've seen it and made history. This movie is an emotional rollercoaster to get through.

First off, all of the characters are great. That's what makes these Marvel films so relatable; that's why we love these characters. They connect with us and we have such love for them. And all the characters, and even the villain, connect with us so much.

Th visuals in this film are, for the most part brilliant . Thanos looks so real, except for one scene where I could tell it was CG. Also, the whole Black Order were done very well, and looked very real.

Thanos himself as the main villain, is one of the greatest villains, if not THE greatest villain. As soon as you see him on screen, you know that there's going to be something very bad happening. Josh Brolin did such an amazing job at his portrayal, and his backstory is very well portrayed. You really do feel for this guy, and when he shows his emotion, it works very well.

The action sequences are long, but they're exhilarating and keep you on edge. Two battles happening at once, one in Wakanda and on Titan, the film cross-cuts between these two sequences and it is very nail biting. There is so much destruction and shocking moments in this film, it is hard to take in. And again, it is emotional.

The humour as well works very well in this film, jokes are on point, mostly revolving around the Guardians, when they're on screen.

However I have my flaws.

The film jumps around a lot during the first half, and I think this is due to the amount of characters they had on screen and in the film. I think they could've handled it a little better though, because it was a bit jumpy.

Also, the visuals were mostly good, except for, again a few scenes with Thano where you could tell it was CG.

I'm going to end my review there are not get into any spoilers, so overall the Russo Brothers made a fantastic film with a lot of effort put into it, that very much paid off. I'm giving Avengers Infinity War 9/10",10
Josh Brolin portrayed Thanos really beautiful.,27 November 2019,He was an amazing villain that kept all the Avengers on their edge and made them think it was a bit hopeless to really go against him.,8

"An epic world view with epic battles, a deep villain with deep reflections",14 March 2019,"I always love popcorn movies with deep reflections on real problems. And Avengers: Infinity War is, IMO, not THE best, but one of the best Marvel movies ever made. If you want to know, I think Captain American: Winter Soldier is the best in MCU.

Let's take away the grand world and fancy effects, this is a movie about a very serious social problem: booming population and limited resources. How do we choose to solve this problem does not make us a villain. It just makes us humans. It also brings the question that does ends justify the means. If you really think about it, this movie has more to offer.

Infinity War builds an epic world. It introduces us to the entire Marvel Universe. It also builds an epic ""Villain"". Thanos, after seeing him in previous easter eggs, I worried he was going to be a classic villain with no humanity. But he's not. In Infinity War, Thanos is a human. He has his background, he has his value. The fact that he only kills to bring balance to the Universe after his world was destroyed indicates that he has human feelings and he wants to solve the unsolvable problem. Most importantly, he has the terribly strong will to act on it. This makes him one of the most well built ""Villain"" in history.

Music, scenes, battles are pretty well designed in this movie. And the shocking ending really gives us huge anticipations for the sequel.",8
it's so good action movies in the world,27 June 2022,,9
It's alright.,28 May 2018,,4
This film needs no introduction.,4 July 2024,"There is no doubt it has been created to set records,but will it be able to surpass the top box offices that is indeed a mystery which the future holds. There is no doubt that Thanos is a big-bady of all and he deserves the most screen time. The film doesn't only contain only fights or humour but emotions too. I remember the first time when i went to watch the iron man back in 2008 when i was just 7 years old and then came the Avengers in 2012....from that moment on i have been waiting for this movie. When the time finally came i was excited as every MARVEL fan would be. From the starting of the film to the end a sort of suspense was created which ties the viewer to the screen. There is no denying the fact that the Russo Brothers have done a MARVELous job on this one. Every plot was rightly set.

When it comes to my favourite scene in the movie....it is the WHOLE MOVIE...thought Thor's arrival was pretty dam lit and the fight on TITAN and New York broke the records. After seeing the film it was for sure that it required a lot of time and effort. This was surely a movie worth to wait for a decade.

To be honest DC movies could never set a plot like this. They just need directors like Russo Brothers and a good scriptwriter. RDJ , scarlett johansson, chris evans, hemsworth and pratt, Benedict Cumberbatch , Tom Holland, Mark Ruffalo, Pom Klementieff, Karen Gillian,Sebastian Stan,Don Cheadle Dave Bautista, Zoe Saldana,Bradley Cooper,Chadwick Boseman,Danai,Winston Duke,Lititia Wright,Vin Diesel,Paul Bettany,Tom Hiddleston,Idris Elba, Bendecit Wong,Elizabeth Olsen and of course THE Josh Brolin has proven that they are the best stars.

Thanks to Kevin Feige and MARVEL for entertaining us from the past wonderful decade.

Love from a fan.",10
The best movie ever made,28 April 2018,"As the title says, the best movie ever made until avengers 4.",10
Entertaining all the way through,26 September 2018,Anyone who loves super hero's will love this film. It has everything in and keeps you guessing. No matter who your favourite character is they play a vital part in this film. A lot of funny little one liners scattered around aswell. I can safely say this is the best avengers film and quite possibly the best marvel film so far.,9
Greatest superhero movie to date,28 January 2019,"The Russos did it again, The Script was great, The Score by Alan Silvestri was fantastic, The Action was awesome and Thanos is in my opinion The best superhero Villain.",10
Wow. Just Wow.,12 May 2018,"There;s nothing to say about it exept wow. I'm not giving any spoilers, just wow.",10
"Almost great,,, but not to cannon, and too much cgi",10 May 2018,"To start, yes i'm a comic fanboy so i do know all the history of these characters and of Thanos. Without going into comic history of Celestials, and forces in the universe like Infinity and Galactus,,,, It does skirt some things to not mention how Thanos loved Death,,, and that Death is an actual entity in the universe,,, and that a huge portion of what he does is for her..... (Death is portrayed as female in the comic...)

Beyond this they should explain his motivation better and his end goal,,,, his relationship with his family,,, etc

But all that aside the things I really didn't like in this,,,, is Spidermans suit being created by Tony Stark and all it's gadgetry,,, I hate that...

And

Tony's suit is now like a bugs bunny cartoon,,, where shields and weapons and alterations happen almost as if when Bugs Bunny reaches behind him and pulls out a GIANT HAMMER,,, three times his size,,, and whacks someone with it.

I like plausibility,, and the armor all the way through Ironman 3 and civil war, worked within reason ability of how it could be plausible, things didn't just GROW,,, they were nested, they were possible...... Now,,, it is all CGI,,, and what i mean by that, is it doesn't look possible,,,,, it looks ridiculous the things that it does...... It jumped the shark,,,, and I feel like that about Spidermans suit too,,,,,

I liked Peter having a plain old suit,,, and web shooters,,, and him developing his own spidey tracer...... the rest of this,,,,, is just silly

Other than those two critiques ,,,, I think the movie did a good job.... telling a complex story with numerous characters,,, many of which are unknown..

I am interested in the Captain Marvel angle, and how they dismiss the Kree Warrior,,, MAR-VEL,,, and running with Carol Danvers,,,,, and how she saves all.... Very interesting.....

What do you think,, about the Suits excessive and improbable CGI",8
Probably my favorite movie of all time,18 July 2018,,10
More of the same...,13 January 2019,"303. Avengers: Infinity War. Heres what I get... There's a big cell phone game app fan out there named Thermos, he loves Bejeweled and Pokemon Go so much, that he decided to combine the two... search for the jewels in real life!! Collect them all, get free gifts, lives, reverse previous mistakes, you've played the games you know how they work. But little does Thermos know, the game apps feel him as a threat, once he collects all the gems, Thermos snaps his fingers and poof all the game apps Thermos doesn't like poof! Gone! So what happens is another app called the Avengers go after Thermos. Now I've played the game apps before, and I always thought that each Avenger had their own unique powers, which after watching this, they're all pretty much equal, and in most cases its the uniform they wear that gives them the power. So Thermos wants to delete half the apps because his cell's memory is almost full. Logical. But the Avengers being just an app themselves feel threatened, but luckily they can power up anytime, somehow they can change the pre existing uniform they wear to combat any situation they are in! Awesome. it all takes place within the Sims universe, obviously, because only the Sims would be oblivious to the alien invasion happening all around them and still go to work the next day, and the Avengers know they are just Sims, otherwise they wouldn't be throwing out one liners while the city and its population are being destroyed around them. In the end Thermos gets his way and kills off half of the apps!! Until he gets an upgrade on his cell for Avengers: Endgame, and/or Disney contracts are negotiated. Also loved the recreation of the battle scene from Star Wars: Episode 1: The Phantom Menace. Droid army Vs the Naboo... only now it was Thermos' computer viruses Vs Wakanda... you're sayin that wasn't intentional? Filmbufftim on FB.",3

Simply Amazing,12 May 2018,First time creating an account here specifically for this. Wow this movie is incredible. Very well emotionally balanced from intensity to tugging on the heart strings to laughing your ass off. The black order were incredibly well done as supporting villains. And all our heroes got the screen time and time to shine. The main attraction though is non othe than Thanos. He was done absolutely perfectly. His mo-cap/CGI has to be the best I've ever seen and the character was so fleshed out. All in all go see this movie!!,10
GREATEST MAR,2 October 2018,"About Infinity War

No, I'm not giving you any spoilers in this post I honor the moral code. ❤

First of all, ""Avengers Infinity War"" is a misleading title. Even though there were Avengers in it, it's still a Titan film; Thanos's film. The antagonist with gentleman qualities who shall not disappoint you. Much like fans, like us, like me, Thanos too was waiting for this moment, which in his own words, ""Dread it. Run from it. Destiny still arrives."" AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED. The war was worth waiting for. Out of Avengers, Thor was the centre of attraction and my personal favourite in the film. (Jabse ye Ragnarok se aaya hai bada comedy ho gya hai.) Thor gave super-humor positive vibes though the tense moments. Truly a God. Other than him, Iron Man's new armour with nano-tech was too much animated but nevertheless quite mind-blowing. ❤ The film mainly focus on emotional element and to be frank it's definitely heartbreaking. Russo brother's blend of humor, action, emotion, in their storytelling was beyond my imagination. It was 'so-damn-perfect.' They earned it.

PS: There's an end credit. Only for those who wait.

""Valar Morghulis."" -Thanos",10
What a bad movie to be so popular,29 October 2018,"Terrible CGI, so many plot holes, I almost fell asleep in the theater because of how boring movie was, all the characters going to come back so they can make more money off of this stupid franchise. Adventures infinity war is one of the most awful movies I've ever seen it is a cluster of characters that I used to care about, not anymore.",1
fantastic,1 July 2018,Too a long time fan of the Marvel cinematic Universe this movie has the charm of the marvel movies while still pulling your heart strings,10
Fun n dark,3 May 2018,"This movie is awesome..hats off to Russo brothers to give such a wonderful movie. The action is great, the acting is great and the THANOS is way good and the best villain in MCU...Hats off.",8
I like that part too,9 May 2018,IT WAS A FANTASTIC MOVIE FILLED WITH ACTION AND PEW PEW AND LIKE ALOT OF DEATHS BUT DONT WORRY DEATHS ARE DEATH AND IT IS INEVITABLE TO AVOID IT,10
Simply Amazing,27 April 2018,"After 10 years we finally get the movie we all wanted! The Russo's do not let it fail, it's funny, serious and lovable. No short cuts all the build up was real. I couldnt be happier!",10
Speechless... (A Short and Simple Review),27 April 2018,"Never have I ever walked out of an MCU film so surprised and speechless! The studio really outdid it with this one! Infinity War lives up to the hype in the most amazing way possible to the point it even lives beyond the hype. With a mixture of such a great sense of humor, which seems to be a common thing now for the MCU to the darkest toned segments you'd think it's a DCEU film (Yes I just said that). The ending is just honestly the greatest yet sudden gut punch, that one would never even come close to thinking about coming from Marvel, but that's what makes the film so great! It knows that it is taking risks but that's what a good film does, therefore what is brought to the audience's attention is the fact that no one is safe!!! Go WATCH INFINITY WAR! NOW!!!!!",10
Marvel's end game sure doesn't feel like one ; but still is a job well done,27 April 2018,"Infinity war had a lot of expectations to live up to. When those expectations contain some characters being written off, they should abide that (pretty sure all the dead ones are gonna be back for the next part). Marvel's epic outing could have been better, if provided with some more drama and plot rather than jokes. The previous Marvel movies had that to its advantage, the jokes and comedic reliefs weren't forced. In IW, it just feels out of place.

Russo brothers might have created a perfect mix and a lesson on how to bring a vast amount of characters into a 2 and half hour movie. Infinity war isn't Marvel's best, but it surely grabs a spot at the top. If IW gonna be praised, praise it. But only for Thanos. Marvel had their long term villain problem fixed with Black Panther. They just took it a step further with Thanos. Thanos might not be the villain that can encompass moral values. He isn't Killmonger. He isn't Vulture. Each had a physical weakness rather than a emotional one.

Although Thanos's reason for erasing half the universe is pretty dumb, the way in which the reason is reached out to the audience is where IW succeeds. IW feels like something just took out what the film should've stood for. For Marvel fans who said that there's gonna be so much weeping in the theaters, i can assure you there was none. If any, they laughed. Marvel yet again delivered one of the most cheesiest one-liners throughout. Although it didn't spoil the seriousness of the movie (try telling that to a DC fan), Marvel should really work on the jokes thing. If marvel wanted to do a comedy movie, bring in Waititi to direct. Apart from a pretty straightforward plot and storyline, IW suffers from too much jokes and one-liners. All these drawbacks might be stomped down by a jaw - dropping ending (provided they stick with it). Marvel, you did it again.

IW isn't the superhero film of the decade, nor is gonna be any competition to the present classics. It is EPIC, DARING and pretty AMBITIOUS. Nothing more, nothing less.",9
I need Jesus,27 April 2018,"Not many movies has lived up to my expectations, but this one even surpassed. Go and see the movie. NOW",9
Disappointing ending and lots of logical inconsistency,1 August 2018,"Well, this movie is certainly entertaining and packed with action and expensive visual effects. It also gathers superheroes from several comics in one place. This feels both fresh and random. It also feels like each character is less interesting, because the writers had to write for so many characters, and they had to spread their effort instead of focusing it. The only actually funny characters here are the guardians of the galaxy, and they are still pretty shallow. The villain team looks like some orcish/undead characters straight from some fantasy video game. The ending might seem like a fresh move for some people, but to me it was just very underwhelming. Not unexpected, no twist, just ""to be continued"", and also on the verge of justifying genocide. This already makes the movie not really worth watching. You get entertained, but it's shallow and empty. And besides that, there are lots of logical inconsistencies. And the biggest one is why would they even fight throughout the whole film? The outcome of their fight is completely inconsistent with their effort. Then, why does the main villain use his powers in some cases and instantly undoes everything that the good guys try to do upon him, but in other cases he just wrestles with them as if he has no superpower at all? And gets no damage most of the time, except one moment where he gets a tiny scar. This really lowers the stakes. All in all, there's no need to watch this movie.",5
One of the best there is,13 May 2018,Its done 8.9 score total this film is the top of the war we are waiting for. Yes go see it. You will not be disappoint. The 10 is a bit high i agree but so many trolls on imdb page to try to kill the rating i need to do something about that i never post review because bad english. So here you go marvel/Disney well done.,10
"The most amaizing film since, a whille I guess",7 May 2019,This film is super great. Before you watch it you have to watch Thor: Ragnarok But once you've seen that you're good to know. Hope to watch how everything turns out in Endgame after this roller coaster of a blockbuster,10
Truly an epic masterpiece! Nearly flawless.,27 April 2018,,10
Finally a great marvel film with an unexpecting ending,27 April 2018,"This was a blast. more than an avengers flick as most of superheroes were in like guardians of the galaxy and black panther and others. only the justice league were not there so to have a complete superheroes mixture.

finally they understand that we are sick of useless videogame action effects. sure there were a lot of such scenes in the film but not as much as u would expect.

2/3 of the film was character development and full of emotion and plot story and only a third was about war and not all of those scenes were mindless action. compared to the previous avengers films this was a huge improvement in this matter. I remember the first film was a total failure as it was a boring action videogame. watch the first film and then this one and see the huge difference in everything.

this film had it all even humor. at times it was more of GOTG movie than an avenges movie. story kicked ass as thanos tried to get the stones ending the world but the best part is the ending. no one could tell what would happen. finally we got a realistic kind of sad ending but finally they tried something different than he usual end where always the good guys win somehow.

all in all it was quite a timed before I really enjoyed a marvel film like this one.

best film of the year so far.

grade // A",10
Worth the 10-year build up,5 May 2018,"After 10-years of story building and character development, this is what we get; a montage of most (if not all) of our favorite characters that needed no story build up to understand where they were taking us in the overall story. The only character needing any maintanence during the movie was Thanos himself and that's because the movie was about him. His arc was the final piece to the 10-year old puzzle and it fit perfectly. Action, comedy, thriller, suspense, with a hint of horror, heartbreak, and romance, this movie was everything I've been waiting for and I'm excited to finish the story next summer.",10

The best film yet!,21 July 2018,What a film both entertaing and funny at the same time.,10
A True Comic Book Movie...With Some Flaws,4 August 2018,"It's fast paced, exciting, and fresh. But, it falls back onto some Marvel movie cliches. Is it the best Marvel movie? I don't know, sometimes big franchises can resort to one aspect of their movies to always fall back on and in Avengers: Infinity War it became very clear. The constant one line witty remarks can drag it down and sometimes have no place. On the other hand, this movie gave three dimensions to a lot of characters. It added more to Tom Holland's Spider-Man and developed Thanos masterfully. Some people may complain that some characters did not receive enough screen time and that's true, but this is the comic book mashup movie the fans have been waiting for. I will add that some characters were poorly developed like Star Lord and Banner, but I really can't fully give my honest opinion until Avengers 4 is released. This movie was a giant cliffhanger which will either seem epic and dull by Avengers 4's answer.",8
AMAZING,3 May 2018,"Just amazing, greatest superhero movie of all time. I love it",10
Avengers,27 April 2018,"Infinity War will be one of the best films of the year, with film directors making a great film not only as a super hero, but as a Hollywood movie that deserves to be seen more than once.",10
Best. Movie. Ever.,11 March 2020,"Aside from the usual spectacular action scenes, this film was beautifully emotional and hard on the soul of fans that have followed the entire saga.

How Black Panther got a best picture nod over this one is truly beyond me.",10
Bold move for a MCU movie,29 May 2018,"A culmination of 18 movies,10 years and a ton of characters from the comics all lead to this. A spectacular visual marvel with a fast storytelling and good ol' comic book action. Thanos most definitely is the main protagonist of this movie and has been done justice in the hands of the Russos. A satisfying screen time for most and doses of unexpected events that would shock even the most veteran comic fans/movie goers. The boldest MCU movie by far and a proper comic book movie. Infinity war is not for the casual movie goers,its a love letter to all those who stayed for the last 10 years.",10
THE BEST MOVIE OF 2018!?,9 July 2018,The movie gives you an amazing experience of superheroes and how some got together to stop thanos. The CGI was AMAZING!!!!! It took the 10 years to creat this amazing movie and it's worth it. The actors were awesome. It was worth every second of my life. I saw it 3 times and was not tired of it. It is the best movie of 2018 till now.,8
Huge Budget Bad movie.,10 March 2019,"From the story to trying to incorporate The Black Panther into the story just hurts the franchise all together. The story starts off good, gets better then goes to the dogs with a ending that just does not make sense.",4
"Not Usually A Marvel Fan, But I Am Now!",6 July 2018,"Since the first Avengers film in 2012, I've gradually fallen out of love with Marvel films. That being said, I was told this film was a must see- how right that is! All I must say is FINALLY an ending unlike any other. If you haven't seen it yet, you're truly missing out.",9
Goosepimples!,3 May 2018,Entrances paired with soundtracks paired with visual paired with excellent villain paired with engaging characters in intense fights alongwith an easy to follow plot makes this easily one of my personal all time favourite movies of all time.,10

Better movie,9 September 2018,,10
Good for scale and quite a bit of fun!,27 April 2018,"Avengers Infinity War was based of the 1991 publication Infinity Gauntlet. In terms of scale, the movie was done well to translate to the big screen. There's no way it could have been done as it played out in the comics as the latter series of Infinity Gauntlet involved Marvel's comics entities(Eternity, Galacticus, The Watchers, The Celestials, etc...) and that would have been way too much. Although it would be very cool to have one or two show up in the final installment to say lend a helping hand and receive and introduction into the MCU. I've read other reviews where it stated that certain deaths lacked emotional punch as they were killed or eliminated only to have their deaths reversed in the final installment. Well, that's how it works in the comics. Death has way since been handled as temporary in both Marvel and DC comics. The other deaths that appeared to be more permanent were done well and I doubt those characters will resurface. There were some characters whose power sets seemed to get amped up quite a bit, i.e. Captain America while others seemed dialed down. Therefore, the way they were handled in battle made them seem a bit like some baby Hulks. And given how formidable Thanos would be with just one stone, the battle sequences were done well to provide the viewer with a sense of legitimacy. Because as shown in the comics, he could have easily defeated many of the characters in the movie with one or two stones, let alone five as he had when he arrived on Earth. I thought Thor's arc was handled well and he was finally given some scenes that actually provide some insight on his true power set and what he is capable of. So outside of the ignant mofos that sat behind and talked most of the movie, it was quite an enjoyable bit of escapism. Thanos was believable and given how much had to be played out in the movie, his character was well done with just enough character development to understand his motivation. The 2 hour 40 minute running time seems to fly by. It's pretty much 0-60 within the first 10 minutes of the movie. So give it a go. If you're a fan boy, you'll understand why much of the movie was shot and made the way it was. Those who don't read comics may have a harder time suspended their sense of belief. Titan was shown as more of a planet as opposed to a moon which it is. That Earthlings could survive on a moon of Saturn without some type of armor or space gear is beyond me. But maybe I'm nitpicking. Go check it out, you'll enjoy yourself.",8

For better or worse: the same as every other MCU,3 June 2018,"In linear algebra, a matrix is said to be rank deficient if one of its rows or columns can be expressed as a linear combination of the other rows or columns. In layman's terms, this particular part adds nothing new to the overall picture, it just uses information that is already present.

This happens to be the defining characteristic of Infinity War, there's nothing new here. What there is is a lot of action, a lot of CGI, and lots of bad jokes with a few okay ones tossed in the mix (exactly what Marvel has been doing for ten years).

The film makes a half decent effort to distinguish arch-villian Thanos from the rest of the baddies, and its kind of succeeds on a minimal level. But in the end, he's just another world conquering fiend who's bigger and stronger than everyone else (Steppenwolf from Justice League?) who is set off to collect some arbitrary artifacts.

Another issue is comes as a side effect of putting so many established characters in. Take Captain American for example, a character whose driven by morals, and whose films are relatively serious, and the Guardians of the Galaxy (about as serious as Looney Tunes). They've done fine on their own, but put them in the same scene and it just doesn't work.

At this point, if you're not sick and tired of Avenger's Universe, then good for you. But for the rest of us, one thing's for sure, haters are definitely going to hate this one.

(If you're not familiar with the IMDb rating formula, you should check it out. While Infinity War rests at an 8.8 at the time of this writing, it will drop reasonably over time as more casual viewers watch the film, and rate it the four or five it deserves.)",5
Sublime,28 April 2018,Start to finish just excellent. One of the best movies ever made!!,10
MARVELOUS!,20 May 2018,"The one sole thing that deserves a 10 on whole movie is the greatest villain of the all. The GOAT! Mister Thanos to rule them all!

God, where do I begin on this masterpiece. It is almost all I would ever expect from a Marvel movie. A whole bunch of heroes, heroines and everything in between. That Armageddon thing just dived me so deep in the movie I couln't look away. The action, cooperation, quick thinking and innovation, Avengers have it all.

And then on the other side (can't really say on which side) you got Thanos is is like The Philosopher of the entire universe. The villain you just can't entirely hate if just listen to what he is speaking. And judge me to be a psycho but it just make so much sense. And when you realize that while he is winning everything he is also losing everything, you just sit there trying to justify his actions so that you don't look like a total ass for liking him.

The reason why I didn't gave movie 10 but 9 is because I saw some stupid decisions that could have been easily avoided, and Marvels greediness. They just wouldn't let go on any of their golden geese. Other then that it is all just flawless. Totally recommend to anyone.",9

The Culmination of The MCU is an Amazing Experience,26 April 2018,"After starting with the first Iron Man 10 years ago and teasing for the first time the big underlying villain that would be Thanos 6 years ago in the first Avengers movie, we have finally arrived to what it all was building up for, and it was well worth the wait. The Movie has an incredible story told in a incredibly paced format, all the characters seem important and are able to shine in their due time, not only that but the comedy was just right and the team ups and fight scenes in the movie are the best I have ever seen. Thanos is without a doubt the best villain we've seen in this universe so far, not only for the long foreshadow but also because of his motivations that are perfectly explained and in a way which every viewer can, in a way, understand why he believes he has to do his mission. Beyond that, the relationships between characters are explored and developed in a brilliant way, which makes the movie feel more alive combined with the perfect editing that makes the two and a half our movie fly by. I must also mention that not only the CGI was amazingly done and detailed but the whole movie had stunning visuals that showed us the amazing universe that was created for this experience. At last, the story ended with an unexpected and wholesome bang, that made me not only tear but also feel complete.

point of view of Villain,16 July 2018,,10
Next level,11 September 2023,"""Avengers: Infinity War"" is an epic cinematic masterpiece that left audiences worldwide on the edge of their seats. Directed by the Russo brothers, this film seamlessly weaves together multiple storylines and brings together the beloved characters of the Marvel Cinematic Universe in an unprecedented showdown with the formidable Thanos.

The film's visual effects are nothing short of spectacular, creating breathtaking battles and otherworldly landscapes. The character development is also impressive, as we see heroes pushed to their limits and forced to make tough choices in the face of an impending apocalypse.

Josh Brolin's portrayal of Thanos is a standout performance, giving depth to the character as a complex villain with a twisted sense of purpose. The interplay between the various Avengers and their allies adds depth and humor to the otherwise intense narrative.

The film does an excellent job of balancing action, humor, and emotion. It keeps the audience engaged from start to finish, with surprising twists and an ending that leaves you eager for the next installment.

""Avengers: Infinity War"" is a cinematic achievement, a culmination of years of storytelling in the MCU, and a must-see for both dedicated fans and newcomers to the franchise. It sets the stage for an epic conclusion in ""Avengers: Endgame"" and will undoubtedly be remembered as one of the greatest superhero films of all time.",10
If you are expecting a Shakespearean Masterwork...,20 May 2018,"...you probably should avoid movies based on comic books. Fun summer blockbuster...now you got it. Ignore the trolls with the 1/10's and the 10/10's from the fan boys and you are left with a good flick.

For me the pace was good and it didn't feel overly long. CGI was throughout(as expected) without being the star of the movie. Decent storyline and plot and very well scripted. Amusing in spots...a bit dark in spots.

Plenty of star power in this one and marvel continues the humanizing of heroes that it invented(the humanizing that is) back in the 60's.

Short review, but ultimately it comes down to I recommend the theatre for this one and don't regret spending the cash even a bit.",8
how wonderful!,12 September 2018,"Always love Russo brothers' films and Avengers series. now they both combine to one so makes me expectable! the box office proved I and Marvel supervisors were correct. Russo brothers made every super heroes play their roles well and his/her power isn't a far cry from another, at least looks like. and the box office is no.1 in Marvel.",10
fell asleep watching this movie,26 August 2018,"I was excited when i have seen fake 8.6 IMDB score of a movie.

so i sat down and started watching.

i was surprised how good was the graphics , but this thig that they call ""MOVIE"" is filming a green screen. you don't call filming a green screen a movie. this film had nothing to offer other than green screen effects. for 12 year old kids - this movie will be good.

God oh god how i was surprised when this 90% of green screen filming thing was rated above movies like ""Interstellar"" or ""saving private Ryan""

"Thanos Strikes Back (Very good, Very Different, Very Funny, Very Dark)",8 May 2018,"Avoiding spoilers, this film is a thrill ride. Its well paced, with good back story to Thanos as we learn who he is, and why he is who he wants to be. Some absolutely more than epic funny moments as all the heroes we have grown up with over the years meet and team up with each other to beat Thanos. I can't think of a single thing wrong with this movie.

The ending has been hot topics since it released into cinema however, I enjoyed the ending. Its surprisingly takes a dark turn and ends in an odd way. However this part 1, and part 2 will be shortly following next year.

But in my opinion so far its one of the best Marvel Films I have seen since Iron Man. It was done very very well, and the film did not feel overwhelmed with all its heroes.",10

Nonstop Marvel action!,1 October 2018,"I watched Avengers Infinity War last night. This movie was 10 years in the making so I was very hyped to watch it. Fortunately it lived up to my expectations.

To start the movie is pure eye candy. All around the movie had amazing CGI. There was something happening every few minutes that was near breathtaking. It really captured the magic of the comic books.

The movie was also completely epic in scale. Everything was bigger for this movie. The fights were intense and in your face and really showcased everyone's super powers.

I also thought the movie did a good job with character interaction. Everyone's favorite superheroes all had their moments to shine. It was also great to see all the superheroes interact with each other.

I really liked Thanos as a villain also. I think he really lived up to the hype as a good villain. I'm really looking forward to the next movie to see how his character evolves.

Story-wise the movie wasn't bad, but let's not kid ourselves this movie was an excuse to see all the superheroes together. The movie did exactly what it said it was going to do. Provide a fun and intense superhero Blockbuster.

The movie does have a very steep learning curve though. It requires you to have seen all of the other comic book movies to really understand the scale of what's going on.

This is also one of the few Marvel comic book movies that isn't quite kid friendly. The movie is pretty dark and lacks the humor most of the new movies have.

I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It is easily the most epic comic book movie ever made. A 8.5 out of 10.",9
The majority has spoken,5 May 2018,"This movie is one of the top movies on this site, and rightfully so. The majority has spoken, so pay no attention to the anti-Marvel trolls who are rating this movie a 1 star. I'm an unbiased reviewer here because I am not normally a comic fan. I have to say that I have seen this film first hand and was thoroughly entertained. I was dragged here by my boyfriend but surprisingly enjoyed it. Great storyline, insane CGI, excellent fight scenes, drama, comedy, just about everything. Seeing this in 3D is even better. 10/10 and nothing less",10

Marvel Delivers Once Again,8 May 2018,"The culmination of a decade worth of planning and preparation that will pay off very well. Continuing in the line of blockbuster movies, Marvel is about to bank in another billion, probably two, and maybe even three with Infinity War. The movie pits the world's great heroes against the universes greatest villain. And it doesn't disappoint. There have been many series that have culminated into a crappy finale, mainly looking at you Hobbit: Battle of Five Armies. Avengers didn't fall into the money grab hole and instead continued on their self-titled, and self-filled track to a hit. A key reason is it was able to balance probably the largest, most-expensive, and most famous cast in film history. The support-characters who fight for screen time in this film, are primetime actors who would be the star in any other movie. The next thing was the villain and henchmen. They made the evil people evil. At points in the film, I was excited to see Thanos henchmen take on the avengers. Not to see the avengers do damage, but to see just how powerful and skilled these followers are. And on top of this, Thanos was portrayed in a such a way to where, we all understood where he was coming from. He wasn't turned into a DC villain where he is just some evil bad guy we've never heard of coming to destroy the world. Instead, Thanos was a villain that is ""evil"" to the core, in the earthly human sense, but at the same time he is a man of morals and passions that are leading him down his path. He even takes chances and risks and sacrifices to get there. It shows how mass murder isn't easy, even when he has all of the power in the universe. At the end of the movie, which really is just a Part one of two. We are left with really their most important goal, and that is anticipation for the movie next year. With a couple of movies separating us from the next sequel, anticipation is building even more. This movie won't be featured in the Oscars, but it will definitely be the movie of the year, and probably the most memorable of the decade. Purely due to the amount of work that has gone into this MCU over the past decade and the success that they have had.",9
Great Movie . . . Awesome to see how it all comes together,25 May 2018,"Ten years ago, I wanted to see Iron Man, but I was nervous about it. To have it start with AC/DC Back in Black . . . I knew the movie was going to be awesome. Have all Marvel movies been gems? Not always, but I never found them horrible either. I'm still on the fence on Iron Man 3; I liked and hated the Mandarin twist but didn't like the ""exploding suits"" scene. And, Age of Ultron, I was a little disappointed with; after all, we were shown the destruction of the Avengers only to have it be a dream-sequence.

This. Movie. Rocks.

Within the first five minutes, BAM BAM BAM. I was in shock, mouth open, barely able to eat my popcorn. From there, to see all of the characters come together. You know, people always complain ""How can the Fantastic Four be in New York and not run into Spider-man?"", ""How can this person exist and not be know by this other hero?"" This movie combines them all, and yet I do see people complain (*cough* DC fans *cough*). Those reviewing this and not giving this movie anything above a 7, must have been watching Overboard. I've seen reviews as low as 1; what movie were they watching?

I don't want to spoil anything. You've seen great details in the trailers. The ending? Shocking . . . and the way it should go. I absolutely loved this movie and plan on seeing it again. Marvel movies are awesome, they get me out of the real world (escapism), and are just far more fun than anything DC can produce. Seriously though, Marvel can tell a good story, real life story, with characters that have super abilities, versus a superhero movie with a story (the ""going to a fight and a hockey game broke out"" mentality).",10

Just amazing and surprising,27 April 2018,I just saw the new Avengers Infinity War movie in theatre and I have to say it's just amazing. I love how Marvel managed to fit all these characters in the movie. Also I wanted to mention that there were a bunch of surprises about the soul stone and what happens at the end of the movie.

Their participation was as important as others. As a whole it was really awesome and I'm hyped about the sequel.",10
Wow,27 April 2018,"Wow.... Just wow.

Avengers Infinity War: 10 years in the making, this is what the whole of the Marvel Cinematic Universe has been building to and boy is it a shocking, enjoyable surprise.

Directed by the Russo Brothers and starring... everyone, Infinity War finally has Thanos collecting the infinity stones, the most powerful items in the universe, together and all our heroes are in a desperate race to stop him.

There's so much that goes on in this movie it's almost impossible to go into detail without spoilers, right from the get go you know that Infinity War has stakes and hopeless stakes at that. They are pulling no punches and surprised me on multiple occasions with their choices. This is the darkest and edgy-est movie Marvel have made but they still kept their light heartedness for the most part, they turned that happy-go-lucky attitude off when it needed and man did it shock you.

Now, this is a big movie huge in fact. But they somehow managed to keep it very contained. Yes there's the big massive group fight, but for majority of the action and story telling its smaller groups interacting with each other. And that's one of the films highlights, there is not a huge team up of every single hero. Instead there's around 3 groups of smaller teams (with 3 different plot lines) and this allows us to see heros we wouldn't otherwise see work and fight together to great effect. And Infinity War does a great job balancing our hero stories with Thanos', yes Thanos has a story and an arc. Speaking of which.

Thanos. Big purple headed CGI Ron Perlman Thanos.... He works. Everything that has been said about Thanos is completely thrown of the table in the first 5 minutes of Infinity War. He is incredibly intimidating and utterly compelling, whether speaking or letting his actions for him. But not only that you almost find yourself sympathising with him and understanding his motives and choices in the movie. You kinda get his thought process. This makes him a fantastic villain. I thought I'd never see a good CGI villian but Thanos definitely proves me wrong.

And I've unlike other marvel movies, I have no idea where they are going to take this. And that is Infinity Wars greatest triumph. Unpredictably. At no point did you know for definite what was going to happen. And you felt that in the cinema. There's of course an after credit scene. Normally around half the audience leave before this comes around, here no one moved an inch.

The only things going against Infinity War is the start can be a tad clunky. Because over the 10 years of Marvel so many different film makers and writers have worked on these characters pulling all that together at times didn't fit correctly. Also the very fact that there's 10 years of pervious movies (18 not including Infinity War), am not sure if casual viewers will get the same impact as those who've seen every single one. Am sure they'll be able to understand the gist of Infinity War but they may have a few questions.

This movie is a blast and came as a complete surprise, which I have no idea where they're going to next. I give Avengers Infinity War an A.

And it was pretty damn cool seeing Edinburgh get punched like that.",9
The Best Marvel Movie,27 April 2018,"This was the best Marvel Movie ever made. The writing was incredible, the plot was up to the mark. All characters did a good job, Doctor Strange was amazing with his jokes and Iron Man was really good, In my country most of the tickets were sold on the first booking day itself. India Loves You. Joe and Anthony you people killed it, My Top favourite heroes were : Spider-Man, Iron Man and Black Panther, I actually love all of em but these 3 are my favourite. Thanos was an amazing villain, the character was really good, I thing he's the best villain. I just can't wait for the Part 2 Like everyone asks ""Where's Hawkeye"" where is he Joe.

GREATEST COMIC MOVIE OF ALL TIME,30 April 2018,The wait is finally over and the war is here. Infinity war is a masterpiece and marvel has once again exceeded expectations which were already set high. The movie ends on a huge cliff hanger and I can't wait to see what happens next,10
An epic undertaking on a massive scale that definitely pays off,28 September 2018,"An epic undertaking on a massive scale that definitely pays off - it successfully combines each of the characters (and their franchises) together well, weaving them into a new story which they can all (almost equally) partake in. Visually it is superb with excellent special effects and settings throughout, and there is the right amount of humour spread across the characters. The plot transitions from the different group of heroes well, and manages to balance the story with the action - the slower, emotional scenes often have the same impact as the large scale and explosive actions scenes. However, the same criticisms of the Marvel series of movies are still there - the heroes are thrown about seemingly to no consequence, the plot just trundles along at times with little respite, and some of the fight scenes are so quick so you can't see the action.",9
Another Great Movie from Marvel,28 April 2018,"This movie was funny, exciting, epic, and emotional. Marvel rewards the fans who have been watching every marvel movie for the past decade with an epic superhero movie that will never be duplicated. By far the best aspect of this film is the interactions between the characters, which were brilliantly written and well acted. Is this movie perfect? No. Of course this movie has some trouble combining all the characters together while attempting to move the plot forward, but everything comes together perfectly with the most emotional and gut wrenching ending to any superhero movie I've every seen.",8

Perfection isn't always necessary,28 April 2018,"For years, people have demanded a superhero flick where the good guys don't always get there way, something that goes against the norm. And this did, it really did. This is amazing in almost every single way, I didn't like how they kept switching from groups to groups because personally I was just becoming immersed and boom, it changes to another group. This film is everything I expected it to be if not more. The trailers made me feel underwhelmed, esp when we got our first proper look at the CGI Thanos, that's going to be used in this fil. Speaking of Thanos, he may be the best villan that the MCU has to offer for very good reason, he's not just your typical, oh I want to rule the world, he actually believes what he's doing is right and goes incredibly far to prove it. I highly recommend this film for anyone, try to watch the other MCU movies and go in spoiler free, for this film to be truly impacting. 9.8/10, would watch again :)",9
An explosive blast of a Hollywood blockbuster MCU movie,7 May 2018,"Avengers: Infinity War is the best film ever in the MCU. It gives everything its all. This movie deserves for more than one Oscar award next year as it is a total blast. The CGI is jaw-droppingly awesome with very good and steady editing and the direction is sheer perfection.

This is one of the movies that I would like to go to the cinema again for another 10 times. This is even better than Black Panther as Black Panther was story ridden but still good.

The writing of the script is very well written with amazing lines that are well said. The acting is out of this world especially from Josh Brolin who plays the villain Thanos who gives it his all.

The action sequences with the fantastic sound, visual and special effects. The music was very intense and dramatic which went well with the action and all the explosives going off.

It's been 10 years since then with 19 installments a TV show and spin-offs, now ending with, Avengers: Infinity War. The Avengers have fought villains of great magnitudes, such as Loki in Marvel's The Avengers, and the psychopathic robot, Ultron from Age of Ultron. But, nothing compares to the Mad Titan, Thanos. In Infinity War, Thanos (Josh Brolin) is a powerhouse. His motives are simple and nothing stands in his way. The way that directors, Anthony and Joe Russo portray him as the main character is a polite surprise. Instead of the Avengers being the main protagonists like the usual, Thanos is portrayed as that role, and the Avengers are the antagonists are keeping the Titan from his goals. You feel bad for Thanos and eventually, understand why he is doing what he is doing. I am definitely giving this a 10/10.",10

The entry of Captain America is one of the best entry scene in cinematic history, second to the entry of Thor in the next part, End Game. The franchise is one of the best and in Big screen, it is an amazing experience. Stream it for sure...!!",10
Way too much,21 January 2019,"Jurassic Park, The Sixth Sense, Alien, Harry Potter and The Hangover are great movies. Putting all characters, realities and styles of these movies into one would probably result in a hidious thing, and that's what's wrong with this Avenger movie. There's too much of everything. More heroes, villains, battles, worlds, stars and CGI do not make a better movie. I really liked the first two avengers movies wich also did have a lot of heroes, but it had it's own style. This was a mix of everything that didn't really match. Thank god part 2 of this movie wich had a lot more of what Hollywood movies often tend to forget : a story, emotions, a twist, a plot,... That could explain the very high rating here, allthough a clickfarm also could. If I get the chance to see the sequal for free I would, but if I miss it, that's just fine.",5
Breaking the MCU mold,8 October 2018,"New and fresh, extremely ambitious and yet still familiar, the final act is absolutly insane! And you will remain on edge for hours after the credits roll, Here The Russo brothers have managed to blend the typical Marvel movie with an Oscar worthy experience of a lifetime",8

Avengers: perfection,20 May 2018,"It was a hell of a ride with this movie! So much emotion, so much joy, so much energy, so much empathy, so much fun, so much tears! And again so much fun! Characters were so real presented, and so relatable. I felt like I was part of them, they were honest, determinated and every scene was intense. Whole movie was understandable, while it presented every point of view of the characters. They were so relatable. I enjoyed every second of the movie! I couldn't believe that beginning would be so intense. Not to mention the end of the movie, which was just perfect...despite river of tears....I think this movie is a MASTERPIECE! The characters were so good presented. So as the villain. Just wow, as Loki. Understandable and amazing! Brolin was amazing and makes the villain shine! All I can say is, MARVEL is killing it! It was amazing and I am proud to be marvels fan! I am till the end of the line with them!!!",10
Great storyline and plot! Awesome movie,20 January 2019,One of the best of the Avengers movies. It felt like we actually dove into the the plot and lived through it with the characters on screen. Looking forward to Avengers End Game.,8

Bring Loki back,3 May 2018,,10
Mindblowing,27 April 2018,"This is the best Marvel movie so far! It's like going to the theater and see the best episode of your favorite tv series, because you know.. it's all been leading to this! The directors were able to fit every character's story in without making it seem forced. Humor is on point and CGI is absolutely amazing! I saw it in IMAX 3D and it was absolutely worth it, I can tell it was one of the best 3D movies since Avatar and I felt like I was completely immersed in the story, both mentally and physically. It has everything you need to see but nothing you would expect, it's a pure experience that will certainly blow your mind, from the beginning to the very end. The countdown for Avengers 4 has begun..",10
Just.... wow,28 April 2018,"This movie blew my mind! I can't believe anything that happened and yet I do believe everything. Although this movie had me distraught, I think it is one of the best Marvel movies ever made! I highly recommend this even to people who don't like these movie because you will just be blown away",9
Culmination,10 March 2021,"You can only really feel the impact of this movie if you've watched the whole MCU in order (its way better, things make way more sense). Most of the Marvel movies are pretty standard and safe. When I first watched this, it was a complete reversal of what I expected.",9
A great MCU movie. But WAY to short.,30 April 2018,"So its all led to this.... But the problem is this much awesomeness CANT be only 2 hours and 29 minutes long! (Actual film length is 2 h 17 m.) This movie needed to be LOTR Extended edition long. Hell if were to be the worlds first 5 hour movie it would have been a GOOD length.

So the movies only flaw is that its very rushed.

Other than that it is a AMAZING movie, But very predictable. And I like that about it. The ending was exactly what I expected and exactly what i wanted.

I am content.

To state it plainly, this is The Dark Knight level.",10
Marvel dissapointed me so much :(,30 April 2018,"After 2 outstanding Avengers movies comes this one. It seems that their only goal was how to make this one so long and without victory for Avangers , so we have to ""wait"" Infinity war part Two. Shame on you Marvel. You spoiled everything you did great with Tony Stark and Hulk.",1
Great Scene,27 June 2024,"One of the most impactful and unforgettable scenes in ""Avengers: Infinity War"" is the climactic moment when Thanos (played by Josh Brolin) uses the Infinity Gauntlet to snap his fingers, resulting in the disintegration of half of all life in the universe. This scene, often referred to as ""The Snap,"" is a shocking and emotional turning point in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU).

The scene is unprecedented in superhero films, where the heroes typically emerge victorious. The snap results in the apparent failure of the Avengers and the loss of numerous beloved characters, defying audience expectations and leaving viewers in stunned silence.

The disintegration of characters like Spider-Man (Tom Holland), Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman), and others is heart-wrenching. Spider-Man's tearful plea to Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), ""I don't feel so good,"" is particularly emotional and highlights the personal cost of the conflict.

The visual effects used to depict the disintegration are both beautiful and horrifying. The dusting effect is hauntingly realistic, emphasizing the sudden and irreversible nature of the snap's consequences. The CGI work is top-notch, contributing to the scene's visceral impact.",9
Long but entertaining.,21 October 2018,"I won't say superhero movies are my favorite genre but I watched most of them as I like easy entertainment sometimes and that's exactely what you get with Marvel and DC Comics charachters movies. In Avengers: Infinity War you get what looks like the end of an era. The ending and explanation of alot of questions from other Marvel movies. You won't get bored with this movie as almost all Marvel characters figure in it. Not only the story is entertaining but the CGI's are like always stunning. They clearly spent a high budget on the CGI's and it shows, it's all quality.",8
Overall a good movie,30 April 2018,,9
This movie has everything your looking for!,6 May 2018,I can't wait to see this again. Marvel has truly outdone itself this time. It's amazing how they tied so many hero's together for one movie. No spoilers here but I just left speechless! This movie is great for all ages!,9
Greatest Marvel Movie,26 April 2018,,10
Real Good! No spoilers,26 April 2018,"This movie is big with so much going on. I applaud the directors and everyone involved in making this movie. Im no movie maker myself but i can only imagine how difficult a task this was to bring so many characters together and make it work but somehow they did. Heaps of action, drama and comedy and a villain that surprised me. Finally, the humour and chemistry between characters was great and Drax! For me, Drax again was the funniest! Stay tuned for the after credits......its pretty cool!",9
Best Movie of all time,16 January 2019,I gotta say this is one of the best super hero movie so far. I watched this movie 6 times in Cinema. And I even bought the Bluray to see it again. All cast did amazing job the writing and direction is super. Cant wait for next title,10
It's all for the money,3 August 2018,"Very angry after watching this movie. It's a trend, started by Netflix, now Marvel also sees a good money making formula to force people and Marvel fans to keep watching and buying the stuff. The formula is this: make a (potential) good storyline, use good actors and great cgi but then make an open end, ready for a sequel. I'm sorry but then there is no real satisfaction after watching the movie. Normally (especially) Marvel movies end well, the good guys win, the bad guys loose. In the old days you get a good feeling and have 2 hours of good entertainment. You can replay the movie back in your head and repeat that good feeling. No not any more, all for the money, more more, make (force) the people longing for the next episode. I'm ok with that with series, but NOT for movies. Movies need to have a satisfactory good end. That is why you watch 2.5 hours of movie. It's that I could watch this for free with friends, but in a cinema I would demand my money back. What would people say if you buy a book and there is no end, you need to buy another book for the end, it's the same thing. So that is why I rate this movie a 1, even though all my favorite Marvel characters are in, lot's of humor, super CGI and everything looks great for a 10 rating, until the last few minutes. It really ruin everything before it back to the lowest rating. Oh and please, it has nothing to do with that ""I don't understand"" the movie. I understand the financial reasons for doing this very well!",1
Completely above expectations,27 April 2018,"Dramatic, exciting & humoristic as one. Story is very easy so you don't have to watch all other Marvel movies. Except The Guardians of the Galaxy so that you know the chemic of the squad.",9
Quite an achievement,27 April 2018,"Could've been a bloated mess but the Russo brothers juggle the huge cast well (although a few characters felt underused). The characterisation of Thanos really underpins the whole thing though - a rounded and well written villain for once.

Some more character beats for the main cast would have been nice but that would probably have extended the run time to 3 hours plus - which would have been fine with me.

Brilliant fun",9
Huge risk,6 November 2019,,9
WOW,27 April 2018,"What a great sequel. The script was great, comedy and drama. Bringing together a lot of the characters from the Marvel universe worked amazingly well. Will see it again tomorrow. Bravo",10
THE BIGGEST FILM OF ALL TIME,1 May 2018,"Avengers Infinity War is ther third instalment of the Avengers films and all I got to say about this is that this film is HUGE and the stakes is larger than life itself. What can I say about this film?This film has a great pace despite being longer than 150 minutes and also being the longest film in the MCU. This film overall is GREAT,the pacing,most of the comedy,the action,the drama,the tension and the romance was suprisingly handled well. Okay so Thanos might be the most intimidating comic book film villain of all time and he in my opinion is the best MCU villain. But,there is a number of flaws which are some of the comedy does not land,some of the subplots felt rushed and the other flaws I will not get into because I would be spoiling the movie already. Also,I could see this movie being a very divsive film. Just go watch it is what I'll say and I will understand if you disliked the film or liked the film. (9/10/A)",9
Best Marvel Movie ever,27 September 2018,10 YEARS OF BUILD UP TO THIS. BEST MOVIE EVER PERIOD,10
Marvel at its best!,10 September 2018,"As a big marvel fan, i can say that this is the best marvel movie so far in the MCU!

Now there will be those that disagree but we all know MCU has been building up to this for some time now, and it did not disappoint, with the witty comedy and typical superhero moments...

I would heavily recommend this movie and franchise to anyone wanting to start a new mcu journey, or for those to rewatch as I can guarnatee you missed something!",9
A lesson learned - don't take movie database scores/reviews on faith!,29 August 2018,"Warning, this review contains a rant with lots of exclamation marks!

Okay, so yesterday evening, my youngest daughter and I had some pizza, and were looking for something to watch on television. I couldn't find anything, so I looked to purchase a movie from one of the digital movie streaming websites. I looked on on THIS movie database (because I used to trust it), and with a score of 8.6 and so many initial 10/10 reviews, I went against my better judgement and purchased the digital copy of Avengers: Infinity War for £13.99. That's the last time I trust THIS movie database!

I felt hoodwinked, and most definitely conned. This morning I had another look at the reviews, and observed that after the initial 10/10s, the rest of the reviews were 1/10. In retrospect, whilst this website perpetuates itself as having integrity in its reviews/ratings, it is my opinion that it is little more than a mechanism for generating sales for movies that under normal word-of-mouth conditions would tank. I feel so angry with myself.

The movie itself is a mish-mash of many different themes, and tries way too hard to be serious. I don't watch these movies for that - if I want serious, I'll watch Heat, Goodfellas or any other number of good thrillers. Why oh why would Marvel screw with the feel good formula of 'Guardians of the Galaxy'?

To sum up, it is my opinion that Avengers: Infinity War should have failed, but didn't - largely due to the manipulation of reviews and information. And I doubt very much if this interference of information was made for free!

If you believe the Avengers are a real, you might actually like this movie - everyone else will likely feel a little low. And to be honest, who needs that in this day and age? If you want to watch some misery, save your money and watch the news instead!",1
"ACTION,COMEDY, and HEART",27 April 2018,"Long story short...one of the best avengers movies yet.

SPOILER FREE!!!,28 April 2018,"As my brain scrambles from scene to scene in an attempt to relive the significance of its originality I've come to the conclusion that this was everything I expected and more. The jump from different city to different planet to different spaceship was relentless but I suppose it just had to be, right? The Russo brothers have given every thought to every single character in this film and has made them all feel as equally as important within the main plot. As for that main plot, well Mr. Brolin may have just written is name down in iconic villain folklore alongside the likes of Mr. Vader and that clown from that other universe... He shows us why he is 'the biggest and baddest villain yet' and makes our heroes seem so 'tiny and small'. Our heros are as appealing, warm and heroic as ever as they put their differences aside to challenge this apocalyptic threat. There's no time for getting to know each other, it's all hands to the deck right from the off! Heading towards the climax the Russo brothers have still managed to keep you guessing right until the grand finale. Then it hits you, like a golden gauntlet to the face! The question is, how am I supposed to wait another year to find out if the swelling has gone down?",10
Ten years worth thte wait!,30 April 2018,,9
"Infinity War? No, infinitely disappointing. Don't waste your time!",6 August 2018,"When I started watching this seemingly endless drag of a movie, I was expecting some of the magic that this franchise has had in the past. It wasn't to be. Instead, we got familiar character after familiar character, each doing their characteristic throw-away joke.

No drama was involved; at no time did I ever think any of the far-too-many stars that were involved were in any danger, or that anything bad could happen; it was all slight-of-hand, all CGI trickery that looks impressive when there's just a bit of it. Here were great heaping glops of it. Acting? None that I could discern, it was all throw-away lines from throw-away characters. These cardboard characters looked better on the cardboard box!

At first I thought of giving this piece of garbage a score of 2/10; but really, this movie is so very bad, and so damaging to the franchise, that a 1/10 is well deserved. It would be lower if I could make it so. This is a throw-away movie.

Very young children and the extremely easily impressed by green-screen effects may like this film, but don't look for a plot or story; it's got lots of familiar faces though. It would have done so much better if it had a decent script-writer! Alas, that was not deemed necessary.",1

Definitely watch this for their effort,9 May 2018,"Firstly, I really appreciate the effort put into the film. They did a great job in bringing the infinity stones/Thanos storyline together. Every superhero got their fair share of screen time. They increased the stakes by killing a number of key characters at the end! But I will say the movie was more about the villain Thanos than the heroes.. so it was missing that typical Marvel touch. All in all, I liked the movie. But I enjoyed some of the previous Marvel movies more.",8
Booooring,21 October 2018,"I really tried to like this movie. I smiled and expressed enthusiasm. I bounced and nodded. I boned up on the Marvel universe. Finally the day came and I watched the movie. For some reason I was completely bored. One fight after another. Lots of stuff blowing up. Lots of people running around. Characters blowing up and running around at the same time. Is it possible I have become overstimulated by this type of adolescent entertainment? Believe me, my girlfriend and I have a better relationship than some of the so-called romance subjects in this hyped up disaster movie. I think I have grown up and comic book characters are no longer my role models. Oh well.",1

Best MCEU Movie By Far! #1 In Sri Lanka As well,28 April 2018,"Engrossing, Epic, Emotional. Those are the three E's that define this movie. This is so much fun. Pure popcorn...now in the dictionary under ""popcorn film"" is just the poster for this film. Somehow, the Russo Brothers have juggled all the parts to give everyone some time in the sun. They are helped immensely by two things: the premise is so pure Mcguffin that you just watch Thanos look for Infinity Stones which gives a primal momentum and that the film's stars/characters are looking to move on - that means, actual stakes for once as people could really die and not just comic book dying either.

The latest instalment of the Marvel Cinematic Universe franchise is at its very best, culminating ten years of marvel adventure, This movie has made me feel things that I haven't about a movie in a very long time. If you are anything like me you will definitely feel a sense of ""everything is gonna be alright"" because of the generous sprinkling of light humour that makes the situation feel less serious than it actually is. The emotional roller coaster that begins right at the beginning of the movie to the very end has you feeling more and more frustrated and on edge as it goes on. Don't get me wrong this movie is absolutely stunning and amazing and a cliffhanger at the end has you wanting more and more.

All I have to say is that whether you're a marvel fan or not, and if you at least know what has been going on in the previous marvel movies, GO AND WATCH IT. It will not be a waste of your time or money. Digest this to prepare for what's to come. Love See how this storyline will carry out in the next Avengers movie. and spectacle with the biggest and most boldest movie in the superhero genre. It's The Most famous movie at the moment in Sri Lanka and I'm sure marvel will appreciate how much of a help Sri lanka is giving to the box office records! Cheers! Weldone! :) :) :)",9

Marvel has once again taken a seemingly impossible task, and proved they can handle anything thrown their way. Each character gets their chance to shine during the runtime, and although there can be clashing tones, the movie never loses its audience. For a common movie fan who hasn't followed the marvel movies, you may be lost. The movie contains no character development, and it doesn't have to, as we've been developing these characters for 10 years. It's fun to see characters you known thrown into situations and forced to interact. This movie is a great time, and any fan of the marvel movie will be happy with it.

At last, a film with real screenplay, direction, characters, emotion, action, CGI, humor, fun, entertainment that keeps you locked inside the screen from the first moment to the last. I hope and wish the next Avengers film to be also that good.",10
The Marvel fans have spoken,30 April 2018,"I saw the movie on Friday. Needed a couple days to digest. I have read most of the reviews to see what people really thought of it. I will start with this, those who scored it low are mainly not fans of Marvel. They have no vested interest in any of the characters. It's too much for them because it's a slew of faceless characters. They are looking for something that isn't there...Drama, speak to world issues (Black Panther), Women's equality (Wonder Woman, The Last Jedi). This movie isn't that. It was written for the fans who have watched and waited. These are characters that have lived for years in comic books. Sorry if you don't like them. We understand our characters. We understand the history and the whats, whys and hows of their storylines here. It means something to us. We are invested. If you read their reviews you will see they complain about something they don't understand that is clear to the rest of us.

Now I will say that some fans were disappointed. I can appreciate that. Not everyone gets what they are looking for. It's not perfect but it's darn entertaining. If you really want to know if the movie is worth watching, read the higher rated reviews. Sometimes the fans can be the most critical...especially after waiting 10 years for this. How bad can a movie be that has the audience jumping to its feet and cheering? Before the ending.",10

A franchise is a franchise is a franchise.....,30 July 2018,"The biggest problem facing franchises is the fact they are a franchise. They offer up a product that looks and acts in a certain way and the net result of that, is it can be very, very hard to reinvent that proposition in a manner that's new and novel.

This is precisely the dilemma I believe is inherent in Avengers:Infinity Wars. If this was the first film of its kind it would probably have gotten peoples attention for presenting an outlandish and to a degree stylish concept, that's new and fresh. Unfortunately, there is nothing new in this formula and its been a long, long time since its been fresh.

The premise is effectively always much the same. Super skilled heroes versus one or more super skilled villains, with the stake being the salvation of a country, a planet, the universe. That's pretty much it. This film does deviate a little from the expected theme, with a surprise ending but that's not enough to save it from being yet another film in a franchise that looks ""all the same"".

On the upside the special effects are excellent and there is some reasonable if not show stopping acting from the collected cast. That I'm afraid is it. I do sympathise with the production house, its hard to know what to do with this concept or where to take it next. I certainly have no answer.

That said this film is what it is. I've seen it all before and I'd be hard pressed to want to see it all again. 5/10 from me.",5
Best. Movie. Ever.,12 May 2018,"Throughout the whole movie, you're feeling many emotions and you start to feel everything that the heroes are feeling. Every second of this movie amazed me",10
good,8 May 2021,"Avengers: Infinity War is a film that should be utter crap. A franchise stretching almost twenty films is unheard of. And making a great and satisfying climax to that franchise is nearly impossible. Considering how many characters Marvel had to juggle together with this movie, there was almost no way this movie wouldn't suck.

But it didn't. Marvel pulled it off. All of the characters were balanced seemingly effortlessly. The action was amazing. The characters were funny. The story was compelling. Marvel made what should've been an overcrowded mess into one of the best superhero films ever made.

This movie will sit you on the edge of your seat for 2 and a half hours. Hats off to the writers, directors, producers, and Marvel Studios.",9

All-You-Can-Eat Buffet Action Film,11 May 2018,"'Avengers: Infinity War' smashed the box office record for biggest opening weekend taking in $258 million on its way to sprinting past a billion dollars in worldwide receipts, becoming the fastest movie ever to do so.

The writing, visual effects, and a truly overwhelming amount of star power all make this film worthy of holding the title of reigning box office king. But my predominant thought leaving the theater was wondering who the hell could possibly follow the film's dizzying two-and-a-half hour story arc ... much less all the individual Marvel story arcs that preceded it, considering 'Infinity War' is the culmination of 18 different superhero movies.

I recognized most of the actors (and most of their characters). But when you have three or four (?) different groups of heroes fighting three or four (?) different groups of baddies on three or four (?) different planets the film quickly turns into an all-you-can-eat buffet of action that, while still very appetizing, is quite a different experience than that of a neatly composed--and somewhat moderately portioned--meal.",8
"Damn, I'm pretty surprised",11 May 2018,"A while ago, before this movie came out, I thought this would be a complete mess. I'm glad to say that Marvel knows how to juggle its large cast of characters like no other company out there, and the direction they took this story is actually pretty great. I don't have much to say about this movie except it deserves the cash its raking in at the box office, and it's certainly worth checking out if you like any of these movies.",9

Best of all the Avengers movies,15 June 2019,"The best, #1, head honcho, big cheese, big deal, numero uno of the 4 Avengers films. You have action, adventure, insane special effects and CG work. Excellent Marvel sarcasm and interaction between the heroes. One of the best villain portrayals, without going into deep character development. So much that at times you will find yourself having emotions for a positive conclusion for the heel. Only drawback of the film is the oversized cast of good and evil participants, which may, limit the screen time for the hero or villain you want to see.",9
Amazing,28 April 2018,Everything I hoped for and then some. Well worth the 10 year wait. I had my doubts but Thanos delivered. 10/10,8

Stunning,26 April 2018,"This film was just blockbuster perfection, after age of ultron and civil war i thought... maybe marvel peaked with the first avengers. This betters that by a country mile.

People are whinging that the film struggles to balance the cast and that the plot is all over the place. Incorrect, nothing felt forced and all of the little meet ups between characters were so satisfying.

The action, obviously was brilliant. Love watching all the little bits of teamwork. Also Thanos is genuinely interesting, not just a CGI baddie that punches things (he does throw a moon though!), he has his motivations and shows some emotion at times.

Where will they go next ??????????",10
Avengers: Infinity war!,19 May 2018,"We've long been heading here and it is finally here! The infinity war begins with a bang leaving you no time to adjust in your seats. You are immediately transported to Asgard and you see Thor and Loki at their most vulnerable. Thanos is on a mission for the stones. The beginning for some reason reminded me so much of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. Ummm... you'll know why when you watch the movie or you'll get my cryptic clue right here.

Then you are in New York and you see Hulk and Bruce Banner battle between themselves in what could only be a superhero midlife crisis that keeps us laughing throughout the movie. Doctor Strange and Wong are now informed by Hulk about Thanos coming to Earth and BAM! We have Amazing Spider man, Tony Stark, Doctor Strange, Wong, Bruce wannabe hulk get into a battle with Maw and Obsidian.

Next thing you know we are in Scotland with Wanda and Vision. Things seem to slow just for a minute and KAPOW! Midnight and Glaive ambush the couple, only to have the Falcon and Black Widow rescue them.

Then we are in SPACE and who do we meet here? The Guardians of the Galaxy, who are attending to a distress call, find themselves in the company of Thor. They briefly exchange pleasantries and then Thor is off to Nedavellir with the Rabbit and Groot. While the rest head to Knowhere.

At Knowhere, Thanos and Gamora come face to face and well they face off and face smash like people do in all superhero comics. Gender no bar.

You thought we were done travelling through the universe didn't you? Nah ah! We then head to Wakanda and the war that ensues there reminded me so much of the LOTR scene where Legolas and the rest are shooting arrows at the Wargs.

Does Thanos get the infinity stones? Will the Heroes live? Is everything lost? Well maybe not because comics always leave you with that glimmer of hope in the bleakest situations.

The movie was done well. There is a lot happening the entire time. There is comic relief and some really serious moments. Every MCU character has screen-time. Don't complain about how little it is though! I love fast paced movies. I love a theme. I love how everything comes together and falls into place. We have been heading here since 2008 and we know every character there is and we know what to expect but can we handle it?

The movie has been directed well. The background score is also on point with the story. The CGI is amazing. I especially loved it in two scenes a LOT! One is the war at Wakanda and the other shall not be mentioned because *spoilers*.

The teenager in you will rejoice. You will find yourself sitting on the edge of your seat. If you've read the comics you will survive. If you haven't, worry not you can always leave us a mail or comment and we'll calm your beating heart.",9

Thor Ragnarok recycled,4 May 2018,"Summary: Infinity war has all the elements of the old trusted Disney recipe. Mediocre to bad comedy, stupid story, flat characters, political correct and kids friendly style.

If you loved Thor Ragnarok , you will love this one. It's only major difference is that there is much less Hulk in this one.

In Detail:

The good thing about the film is that it brings all our favorite marvel superheroes together without feeling overcrowd and giving each one of them its own role in the film without using him or her as mere decorations. The ending although partly expected, it has a good deal of surprise.

Overall however the film suffers from a ton of issues:

1) The elephant in the room is Thanos himself, he suffers from the same issues as Steppenwolf in JL. As a villain he is everything you expect to see, a bad guy wanting to do bad things. Their only difference is that dialogue wise Steppenwolf takes the edge with some really unique lines, Thanos takes the edge of having a bit more complex plan. But overall this is a ""what you see is what you get"" situation for both of and sadly they also both suffer from the plastic face CGI issue. Overall much of the motivation of Thanos makes little sense and the film does not seem able to decide the most basic whether Thanos is mad or plain stupid.

2) Hulk has been a big issue in all Disney films but never as much as in this one. He is pretty much non existent in this film , gone are his old days of ""we have a hulk"" , maybe there is a reason a surprise element left for the sequel but after Disney turning Hulk to this big cute meatball wrecking havoc depriving him of his Marvel identify of the stuff of nightmares and horrors , my hopes are very low on this one.

3) Disney of course does not stop there at destroying any link with the comics, an art they have perfect since the first movie they made. Thor for some weird reason is completely overpowered. The guy that barely made it alive from a fight with the Hulk in Thor Ragnarok , the first fight he discovers the peak of his powers , seems unlike Hulk to have no issues whatsover taking Thanos by himself. Why ? Again none knows.

4) Spiderman once more is reduced to Iron Man's sidekick. His role in the flim is completely unnecessary , even though he does indeed participate and contributes his own powers this film, these powers are like Homecoming extremely town down. His insane agility is long gone, his spider sense just a shadow of the one in the comics and of course what remains is his high reliance on his armor of course made by tony. Essentially if Iron Man is Dr Evil, Spiderman is Mini Me. It's pretty obvious that Disney is pitching Spiderman as the new Iron Man , although Holland acting skills are nowhere near those of RDJ.

5) Comedy was always the weakest part of Marvel films. Usually its a hit and miss situation, throw random jokes on the wall , see which one sticks. This film manages to be even worse than Thor Ragnarok. Some very good jokes, most of them you see them coming miles away.

6) For me Hulk was not the big surprise on how underpowered he was but Dr Strange. Marvel has already establishes that he can run circles around Thor and Loki combined , yet in this one he seems to display a tiny fraction of his abilities

7) Which brings us to another problem stemming from this inconsistency, action scenes. None of the fight scenes are really exciting, the most exciting is nothing more than a recycle from a similar scene in Thor Ragnarok.

8) Last but not least, character development is non existent. Infinity War seems to follow Civil War but again there is no discussion on the big gap that it left to the team, the film starts with an indication that it may address the issue but then as soon as Thanos visits our planet, its no longer an issue. Disney logic at its best.

All my fears since watching the trailer have been confirmed and I would be surprised if the sequel is the first superhero movie not bothering to watch.",4
The best Marvel film I have ever seen,28 April 2018,"This film depicts many stories that come as one for a final battle against an unstoppable tyrant. The stories are all 3 dimensional. The movie moves at a consistent pace where we do not feel too rushed or too slow. There are no parts whatsoever which lack in character. Throughout the film you've got a raging stiffy. This is created through every amount of screen time which shows Captain America. This is not a film that non marvel fans will hate. This is one they shall love. This movie caters to their fans, dropping in Easter eggs here and there. The film will put you in a mental coma. Please watch at your own risk. Batteries not included.

This was written by the residents of the pentagon. Each sold separately. Hot wheels beat that",10
A real shocker,31 July 2018,"After 18 films and 10 years of building up to this moment, Avengers: Infinity War has finally been released. It is directed by Joe and Anthony Russo who also directed two other films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe: Captain America 2 and 3. The film is a huge culmination of 18 films and 10 years of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Before the film was even released it was already bound to be huge as it had 2 unique selling points. The first is that Infinity War marks the first time that a feature-length movie has been filmed entirely on IMAX cameras. The 2nd is that the directors promised that several characters will be killed off which was something that fans wanted due to the argument that the films lack stakes if characters always survive.

There are over 40 main characters in this film with pretty much every superhero from previous films making a return. These include: The Avengers, The Guardians of the Galaxy, Spider-man, Doctor Strange and Black Panther and others as well as a lot of their supporting casts. Despite it being an Avengers film, the primary antagonist, Thanos, has the most screen time and we mainly go with him throughout his plan. This has the positive effect of making us sympathise with him and could arguably make an audience slightly agree with his points and motivation. Honestly, I believe that this was the right idea as it added more depth to Thanos' plan to collect all 6 infinity stones in order to wipeout half all life in the universe as apposed to some villains who seem to just be evil because they are evil.

The film had a good level of balance. It wasn't trying too hard to be funny like some predecessors were however had some level of humor that we have come to expect from Marvel films by now. It was a joy seeing the mixture of some of the characters such as Iron Man, Doctor Strange and Star Lord's ego fueled arguments and the Guardians of the Galaxy swooning over Thor's physique. Also, who didn't cheer when Thor, Rocket and Groot landed in Wakanda. There were some things that I expected to happen that didn't. For example, I thought Iron Man and Cap would reconcile after their fight in Civil War. But I guess we have Avengers 4 for that. Which brings me to the film's conclusion... At first it had me speechless. I genuinely could not believe that it was over. It played with many peoples emotions and honestly, there were grown people crying in the cinema (admitedly myself included).

Another thing that I would praise is the soundtrack. There are some parts of the films where the original score from the first film appeared such as when Captain America, Black Widow and Falcon appeared. However the theme does change later symbolising the darker tone. This is especially seen during the end-credits with the slow sound of the piano ending the theme.

One negative thing I would say about it is that because of the amount of characters and amount of things going on, it is quite hard to keep up with it all. There were times when I forgot about certain characters and their motivation and I believe that this could put a lot of people off or make them lose interest. Another thing is that whilst some deaths were really heartbreaking, others were slightly less impactful as we can tell that they will return in the future which can lead you to wonder if none of these deaths actually matter. On the other hand though, we have to live with these deaths until 2019 when the currently untitled Avengers 4 is released.

I would 100% recommend this film to fans of comic-book films and also to people who have a problem with them being repetitive as this film changes the norm of what would usually be seen. I heavily enjoyed this film and it is en-route to become one of my favourite films of all time, partly because of the sheer scale of it and partly because of the shock ending. This was a Thanos movie at heart and I would go far as calling him one of the best film villains of this decade. It did a stellar job of putting together a storyline that they had been building for 10 years whilst also getting people excited for the future.",10
Exiting!,5 February 2020,"One of my best experience in a cinema! A lot of action, great characters, my favorite superheroes movie.

Best marvel movie,5 May 2018,,10
The penultimate chapter in a 10 year saga sets the stage for a satisfying conclusion,10 April 2023,"As the intergalactic Titan warlord Thanos (Josh Brolin) ravages the galaxy in search of the 6 infinity stones, heroes throughout the Universe assemble to stop him from unleashing his plan of culling half the universe.

Avengers: Infitiy War is the 19th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and inspired by the 1991 storyline The Infinity Gauntlet by Jim Starlin for Marvel Comics. The intention had been from the beginning by Marvel Studios to lay the groundwork for a massive crossover wherein the characters of the MCU would fight Thanos and beginning with the character's first teased appearance at the end of the first Avengers film, there was a conscious effort to link several MacGuffins from various individual films as ""Infinity Stones"". Anthony and Joe Russo signed on to direct the two part Avengers Infinity War films following their success on the Captain America which along with writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely whom had shown their capability in handling and balancing large scale projects with an ensemble cast. With both films touching upon nearly every aspect of the MCU established up to this point, the $400 million production became a smash success making $2 billion worldwide becoming the highest grossing film of the year. The movie also received critical acclaim and rightly so as it's a film where it feels like your patience and attention has been rewarded with a threat that has heavy stakes and a memorable villain.

From the first moment where the movie begins that sees Thor, Loki and the surviving Asgardians casually taken down by Thanos, this is a story where nothing feels like it's safe or off limits. While the movie covers a large ensemble cast of almost every character (save for Ant-Man and Hawkeye), the movie's plot is kept pretty simple and straightforward with it basically boiling down to a race to get the stones and/or keep them from Thanos while the primary focus is on the characters and how they're handling this situation. The movie went through a lengthy development process in terms of writing and deciding which characters would be teamed up with others and the crossover element is well handled with some unique pairings of Rocket and Thor or Doctor Strange, Iron Man & Spider-Man leading to some great character friction both on a dramatic level and on a comedic level but not to the point where it feels like it undermines the drama. I rather liked Josh Brolin as Thanos and his performance gives a lot of weight to a character whose appearance is that of an 8 foot tall alien in golden armor. If I were to criticize the film I'd probably say Thanos' companions ""The Children of Thanos"" aren't all that well developed and to the best of my knowledge I don't think their names are spoken during the film.

Avengers: Infinity War feels like The Empire Strikes Back of the MCU with heightened stakes, a desperate situation and an ending that feels like it leaves the audience at their lowest point.",10

"A modern superhero film that's not afraid to take risks, while also delivering on the laughs, thrills and spectacle that audiences have come to expect from the genre.",22 July 2018,"'Avengers: Infinity War' shouldn't have worked. It has over 20 major characters and only 149 minutes to fit them all into a cohesive story, but somehow Anthony and Joe Russo (along with screenwriters Stephen McFeely and Christopher Markus) managed to not only make it a good comic-book film, but one of the very best. The fact that it brings together multiple different franchises is a groundbreaking achievement in its own right, but the film actually accomplishes more than that. It's a film that's not afraid to take risks, one that takes audience expectations and completely smashes them, delivering something that stands out from the rest. The majority of characters are well balanced (apart from Steve Rogers, in my opinion) and the pacing never drags, aside from a couple of side-plots being slightly too long. The film also has a good handle on tone; it knows when to be funny, but never loses its sense of drama and fully delivers on its most serious moments. The action scenes (while mostly GCI driven) are all exciting and grand in scale, and the score by Alan Silvestri is one of his best in years. On top of all that, the film is always fun and has its fair share of epic goosebump-inducing moments. The ending of the film initially felt disappointing, but reflecting upon it made me realise that it was actually perfect and one of the things that makes the film so great. It's not the best film of the MCU, but the way in which it takes real risks and offers a genuinely unique experience elevates it to be one of the very best in its genre. 9/10",9

Hitting The Mark On Balancing Cinema & Staying True To the Comic,8 May 2018,,8
Great for all it could be,6 May 2018,"The movie was great, but I didn't feel the same level of excitement or shock as some others did upon exiting the theater. Overall, they did do an excellent job of giving balanced screen time to the many characters who played their part in Thanos' quest for the stones. I have my theory about what will happen in the next film, but I'll reserve giving a thorough review for the sake of spoilers. Bottom line, if you've enjoyed at the Marvel movies so far, you'll enjoy this one. If you haven't seen the majority of the films though the one liners may be lost on you and you may be slightly lost with the many characters and dynamics of their relationships.

Side note: Particularly enjoyed the exploration of the relationship between Gamora and Thanos as well as Gamora and Nebula. I actually wouldn't have minded seeing a film entirely devoted to this back story as well as further exploring The Black Order or Children of Thanos. It would also be awesome to see things entirely from the villains point of view and this film certainly does not make Thanos the typical villain. He truly believes in his cause and the film did a great job of allowing the audience to connect with him on that level.",8
Incredible,28 April 2018,"If you're a fan of the previous movies, this film will definitely make you laugh one moment and cry the next. The movie starts an incredibly fast past, largely because the tension has already been built up in the after credits of the previous films (Thano's 2-3 cameos). The star of this film is definitely Josh Brolin, as he displays unique emotional depth as the nihilistic villian Thanos. I don't think I've seen another movie that packs quite so much into the time frame given I wouldn't have cut or added anything. After the film was over, everyone in the theater said something similar to ""I need to go sit down and think about what just happened."" This is likely due to the emotional shifts, the constant struggle of the characters, and the sense of unending dread the movie makes you feel. I gave this movie 10 stars, because there really isn't any valid criticism to give. This was an incredibly hard movie to pull off and my hat goes off to the guys at Marvel and the directors for being able to do so. I'm excited for Part 2 and the next Phase of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.",10

Better than I thought...,28 April 2018,"After ""Black Panther,"" and ""A Quiet Place"" (2 films which received very high critical praise even though I personally thought they were long, boring, predictible nonsense films pretending to be something more than what they were) I had exremely low expectations for this film. I thought about skipping it all together. Without spoilers here is what I thought of ""Infinity War.""

Pros:

Light hearted Marvel style comedy is back in full force.

Getting a fix of my favorite Marvel Characters ( i.e. Thor, Dr. Strange, Star-Lord, Groot, Rocket, Spider Man, etc.).

Several big budget action scenes.

Not pretentious. It's a big buget superhero film and doesn't try to be anything else.

The 3D was worth it.

Cons:

The Marvel film release schedule removes even the slightest doubt that certain characters were never in any real jeopardy (i.e. Black Panther).

Thanos is more exposition than action. He's probably the weakest part of the story even though they try hard to flesh him out. I can't reconcile the man with the monster he has already been painted as in previous installments. It may have been better to leave him pure evil than to try and rationalize his actions. He feels kind of silly now.

Wakanda... still fighting with spears and shielding themselves with those goofy blanket cape forcefield thingys (at least there were no rhinos this time).

Most action scenes were so far removed from civilization, it felt like there was not much at stake.

No mention of Valkyrie. I hope she gets her own movie, maybe an R rated one like a female Deadpool.",8
Best avengers movie out of all of em,9 June 2019,"This movie is amazing. Full of action and emotions, great story, straight to the point, and probably one of the few movies that end in a bad ending.

Grootloose,19 May 2024,"Having spent years avoiding these gigantic MCU milestones it's fascinating for me that it's this ""set-up"" film that is far superior to the actual finale. Infinity War is just this hugely extended actual ... living comic. Full of melodrama, big punch-ups, this big devastating finale and great character moments. It's almost terrifyingly overstuffed and the Wakanda climax feels a little tacked-on and clumsy but I was dizzy with glee throughout. Also even though I'm well-past knowing the full ins-and-outs of the finale it still had this absurdly harrowing quality and I cannot imagine the impact it had at the time.

Years ago, every superhero had it's own flick so it was for outstanders easy to know what it was all about but once the Avengers franchise started it became another thing.

Not only that, you will need to see all movies to unerstand what is going on. There are no flashbacks to keep you on track. Is that bad, no because by doing so the story starts immediately. If you are not in the Marvel world forget it, you wont understand a thing what is going on.

Clocking in over 2 hours it of course have some moments that you think, really, but overall this is a flick full of action with topnotch effects. And every superhero does what he normally does, meaning, spiderman is funny, the guardians listening to those old cassettes.

This is really a Marvel world as it should be, but if you are not into that world you still van enjoy it but too understand it all it will be hard.

But surprises fall utterly short when it comes down to this movie. This movie doesn't surprise you with just a twist scene or an event, it surprises you with its tone. Holy Hell! From the first SECOND of the movie, literally, you could tell it's gonna be a bloodbath and a heartbreak. Real stakes? These are stakes so real you'd wish they weren't. Action scenes? This movie gives you so much epic scenes you'd get lost after you walk out of the movie on which was your favorite! And the villain? GOD DAMN, Thanos is a menace! Not best marvel villain. But one of the best villains period. The movie balances action, sadness, comedy, goosebumps, and shocking events perfectly. Easily, the best MCU movie and definitely the best Superhero movie to date!!!",10
The best Marvel movie ever,30 April 2019,"After watching Endgame yesterday I start appreciating it even more.This movie had everything : incredible twists, character development, thriller action, best acting, no plot armor etc.",10
"this film is Better than Kamen Rider Build and Ryuki,",12 September 2018,,9
Amazing,28 April 2018,This film exceeded expectations it was incredible.,10
I fell asleep...,30 April 2019,"If you are gonna watch this then do not waste your money, make it free, it is not worth £15 or $19. The whole thing was a big CGI fight and bored me to hell. Thanks Marvel. Thanks.",1

Excellent!,5 November 2018,,10
Excellent film!,28 November 2019,"The Russo brothers really did a great job in making this movie, an epic conclusion to the first decade of MCU.",9
Another politically driven flick.,9 March 2019,"Throughout this movie everything is unrealisticly biased against Thanos and his crew. One second Thanos twitches his hand and disarms any threat as if hes flicking away a bug on his arm, the next second hes completelly incapable of defending himself or use the same powers. Same story with the rest of his crew.

The CGI could be better especially for Thanos as he walks as a cartoon caracter almost howering above ground weightless, but overall great! The story is interesting but couldve been more spicyvalthough easy to follow and entertaining and the acting is great as is the sound and music.

Only thing bad about this flick is the political message and social engineering through its bias in story and acting. Its not overwhelming as in the racist flicks of Black Panther or as sexist as Captain Marvel but its there. You know how the follow up will end thanks to this bias making everything Marvel produce annoyingly predictible and booring.",9
Best film of all time,27 April 2018,It's the best movie I've ever seen. It's a masterpiece from the point of view of Sam. The role of all the characters is perfect in itself. I hope Thanos is doing this and I am trying to convince myself that the universe is the owner. Can you be happy after you have done these for the death? Let's see what I will live in Part 2. It is a long time to wait for another year.,10
Another mind numbing marvel trash movie,13 May 2018,"Well, it is we the people who finance such utter trash by buying tickets so we might as well claim our part in promoting this stupidity! I had bought this as part of a friend's night out at the movies but we found the movie so predictable that we stepped out in the break!! Avoid!!!",5
"A near impossible project to tackle, done surprisingly well.",26 April 2018,"Infinity war is a project so grand in its scale that you can't help but feel impressed that a decent, if not good movie came out of this.

Its major flaws however, lie in the grandeur of the movie. The amount of characters and storylines in the movie muddle the waters and bring about heavy tonal inconsistencies and pacing issues. This also made each character less special and with less to do however this was masked with the cleverly thought out character interactions.

The Core of the movie is in Thanos ( and a truly wonderful motion capture performance by Josh Brolin ) who does not disappoint and is given plenty of room to stretch and develop which makes for a compelling final act of the movie. The writing is also very sleek and tries it's hardest to make the first half flow smoothly but falls short.

All in all there are some disappointments and let downs that keep this movie from reaching the level of ""A dark knight"" or even ""A winter soldier"" but the audacity to tackle such a challenge with the class and style it did deserves to be appreciated a and seen.

Just an Opinion .",8
Not Perfect But Damn Near,27 April 2018,"Wow. I'm having trouble deciding whether I want to give this one 9 or 10 stars, but I know those are my only options for a film of this grand scale. Where do I even begin a review for this film?

Let's start with the pacing. The Russo Brothers proved they can handle directing a film with a huge ensemble cast with Captain America: Civil War, and one-upped themselves with Avengers: Infinity War. Despite the film carrying the weight of the Avengers, the Guardians of the Galaxy, and other Marvel characters of equal importance such as Doctor Strange and Spider-Man, and despite the film having roughly 5 different storylines all happening at the same time, the film handles it quite well and gives each storyline enough screentime with enough spacing. The film does feel long, but, at this point, you don't want it to end!

Thanos is by far done justice in this film; it's evident the Russo Brothers prioritized developing Thanos as a character with twisted but understandable philosophical motivations. The film dedicates great care in fleshing him out as a character rather than leaving him as some one-dimensional ""big baddie."" Infinity War also makes Thanos an actual threat, and this was the first Marvel movie for me in which I thought the stakes were at its highest; the characters we've grown to love through this franchise are seen at their most vulnerable against Thanos, and that's emotionally terrifying to watch. Avengers: Infinity War is just as much about the spiritual and emotional journey Thanos goes through searching for the Infinity Stones as it is about the Avengers.

With all the darkness that I seem to point out in this film, this film still has the characteristic Marvel quips. It became fan service many times as I'm sure fans imagined how their favorite characters would interact upon meeting each other, and many of these came to life, much to the pleasure of the audience.

One of my favorite things about the Russo Brothers' direction is their action. The action sequences are framed excellently and add to the brutality of the Infinity War. I was interested in seeing how they would direct these more cosmic and special effects-laden action sequences, given, within the scope of Marvel, most of their prior action sequences in The Winter Soldier and Civil War were more practical and focused on hand-to-hand combat choreography. That said, they used the superpowered special effects efficiently without any excess. There are countless action sequences I couldn't wait to see happen on screen, and they completely delivered in emotional weight as well as in sheer energy.

There are some flaws that I felt were a part of the film. There are several characters that feel underused in the film's plot. Some characters are just there without really adding so much purpose to the film's plot, and are limited to minor plot points or one-line quips at best.

The film ends on a cliffhanger and essentially relies on the necessity of a sequel rather than a mere implication of one, but we already knew that going in. Still, even though I knew well in advance that a sequel would be coming, I can't help but feel unsatisfied by the cliffhanger ending and, because I knew there would be a sequel, it made me less emotionally invested in the events in the film because I know there's ""more to come."" Given that all Marvel movies previously ended on a non-cliffhanger note, I admire that this film adds something new to the mix and ends it on such a cliffhanger, but at the same time dislike it for the feeling that it lacks completion in the story. It's like the ""Empire Strikes Back"" of the MCU. Certainly the ""climax"" of a larger story arc, and in hindsight perhaps the best of the franchise once we see the rest of the story arc.

Overall, Avengers: Infinity War retains the Marvel charm and organic humor we've come to love as fans of the MCU, while setting a new standard for our conception of Marvel films with a level of intensity and emotional weight in the storyline. It is Marvel's darkest, most emotional and intense film to date, and you'll enjoy each and every 156 minutes of it and leave the theater wanting (or, in this case, needing) more.

Truly outstanding! Avengers at its best!,28 April 2018,"This film is Avengers at its best! Avengers infinity war is another one of marvals truly amazing films where they are not scared to do things that will shock the viewer. This is the only marval film I have felt that the Avengers and all the of the MCU characters have met their one enemy they can't defeat through just punches and cool abilities. Absolutley amazing and the soundtrack is even better with its more dark tone.

Great film!",10

Movie with the first ending ever,28 April 2018,"I guess I will be dissenting reviewer here among the many other apparent glowing reviews here.

I have watched the various Marvel movies and in particular the Avengers series released over the last 5 years. This one has got Marvel heroes and villains raining in left right and centre from the start with limited background or story to set the scene. The comedy in the face of apparent disaster seemed misplaced.

And I have to say it has probably got the most anticlimactic ending ever. I won't go into the details to avoid spoilers for those of you have not watched it yet. However i appreciate this was probably to get people to watch the next movie. But myself and the rest of the viewers in the theatre i was at today was shocked at this abrupt ending with little meaning or explanation. Was not impressed hence the 4 rating.",4

Movie of the Year !!!!!!,28 April 2018,Best movie ever! Completely went against all predictions!,10
Exceeded all of my expectations. And my expectations were extremely high. Wow.,27 April 2018,"I have been a major fan of the MCU since it's beginning, starting with the first Hulk move that was made. My love only increasing with the first Iron Man. If you are as big of a fan as I am, this movie should be a top priority. I can't even begin to describe the utter beauty of this movie. I was crying, laughing, crying, getting chills, laughing again, crying again, and so on. Marvel has outdone themselves with the CGI and effects in this movie, as everything looks incredibly real. You see emotions, the tiniest movements, and incredibly realistic wounds in the faces of some CGI characters. They are just so real. Don't let other reviews fool you when they say the plot of this movie sucks. I felt it was incredibly well-driven, even though this feels like 2-3 movies put together. But who wouldn't want to see multiple movies flowing together into one? Isn't that why we all love the MCU so much? The characters were amazing (as always). The Black Order was incredible, as each of them could have been standalone villains in their own movies. Thanos was just the best villain I have seen in any movie in a long time. I empathized with him, hated him, and had that moment where I was like, ""You know? He's kind of right. But he's still a jerk."" Just, all I have to say is Marvel truly outdid themselves. The ending is just...wow. They could not have carried that out any better than they did. Perfection. I found nothing wrong with this move. (Well, maybe just one thing: Where did Wanda's accent go??)",10

"10 years,but is it worth it",28 April 2018,"10 years,18 movies and 72 characters all lead up to this one movie.It was all leading up to this after 10 years in the making thanks to Kevin Feige well-oiled marvel universe, And I'm gladly here to tell you that Avenger infinity war is a really good film except for some of the minor problems which are some of the characters were not put in the spotlight but I see why they could not do this because they just had 2 hours 40mins and tremendous amount of characters but you don't realise this until you are trying to find yourself after the ending of this movie, the ending is one of the most breath taking movie events in history. Thanos is well present as a mad Titan as he is one of most powerful marvel movie villain till this date and is the only villain that breaks Marvels bad villain curse because you can see during the movie what chaos he can actually bring to the universe.All the characters are given as much of screen time they can get but truly own each scene they are in, unfortunately, All of the characters split up into teams for the majority this film but the meet up at one point or another.

I would highly recommend this movie to everyone, please bring a box of tissues to Avengers Infinity War because this is truly a culmination of the 19 films that came before.",8
Incredible movie with minor disappointments afterwards,12 September 2018,"Infinity war is a great movie experience. The film is written in a way that has 1 huge advantage and 1 huge downside.

The action packed, character packed movie offers a great experience, especially in a IMAX movie theater, time flies by and lots of awesome moments occur. The scale of the movie also means that some of the favorite characters get undercut heavily tho.

Photography and special affects were masterfully done, acting was superb... my one disappointment was the ending. Just another ploy from Hollywood to milk movie goers out of more money.

This movie achieves exactly what it set out to do, and with so many characters in play, it is an absolute miracle it is not a complete mess. When taken as a stand-alone movie, it probably doesn't deserve this score and the same is true if you aren't fully invested, but as an MCU fan, I really can't give it any less.

"Perfectly balanced, as it should be with this big of a cast",17 April 2019,"Incredible work by the Russo brothers, no character felt really overlooked and the movie has good paste, a good structure and plot. It's near to perfect for me. I think why this works is because this movie is mainly thanos his movie. Instead of avengers they could have based the title of the movie around thanos as well. Really well done and a very good setup for endgame (but it stands on its own as well).",9
If It's Action You Want,2 May 2018,"GRADE: B

THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.

IN BRIEF: A superhero movie with a puny and weak plot and non-stop action.

JIM'S REVIEW: Superheroes. They come in all shapes and sizes, with varying super powers and enough attitude and skill to fight against evil and protect mankind. More importantly, they rake in millions at the box office. The DC Comics and Marvel universe have taken over the movie business and offer critic-proof blockbuster after blockbuster for the insatiable moviegoing public.

But perhaps my favorite crusader comes from neither source. He's a little big man by the name of Buzz Lightyear whose famous catch phrase and mantra was...""To infinity and beyond"". That classic line may be over two decades old, but this toy oracle saw the future of cinema back in the mid-nineties. Which leads us to the 18th film from the Marvel Studios series, Avengers: Infinity War, the latest pop entertainment from one of the most successful and profitable franchise in cinema history.

In this installment, we discover that there has been a rift among superheroes. There is Team Ironman and his loyal crew of major and minor characters (Thor, Spiderman, The Hulk, Doctor Strange) versus Team Captain America and his colorful line-up of rogue groupies (Black Widow, Vision, Scarlet Witch, War Machine, White Wolf, Winter Soldier, Black Panther, Falcon), plus the Guardians of the Galaxy crew. Lots and lots of superheroes with little time to spare for deeper character development but lots of time for CGI and action stunts. Yet what will unite them all?

Why, of course, a truly bad villain, namely Thanos, who wants all six of the magical infinity stones in his possession in order to dominate the world! (Maybe, collecting trading cards of all of the assembled superheroes might have been a more challenging goal for our conflicted outlaw.) Yes, the plot is puny and weak, but the consequences to stop this megalomaniac are of the life and death variety. So all you need to know is that the battle lines have been drawn over the prized McGuffin, with one battle scene leading to the next for maximum enjoyment. ACTION is in not in short supply, even if logic and high drama take a backseat to the frequent combat sequences.

Anthony and Joe Russo ably direct and keep the pace at warp speed lest they disappoint their youthful target audience. A screenplay by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely juggles the misadventures on the different planetary destinations with varied results, some are simply more interesting than others. To its credit, it establishes many likable quirky characters and their camaraderie is infectious due to the actors' personal stamps on their recognizable roles. Yet the movie has a hard time spreading its narrative with a balance of equal screen time and does little to advance the development of some central characters and their interrelationships. Too often the numerous sub-plots and mini-expeditions with such a large ensemble wears thin. Dialog has some clever humorous retorts but rarely aspires to any real poignancy or gravitas.

The gangs all here, with an all-star ensemble that includes Robert Downey Jr., Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Benedict Cumberbatch, Don Cheadle, Tom Holland, Chadwick Bossman, and in lesser roles: Paul Bettany, Elizabeth Olsen, Tom Hiddleston, Anthony Mackie, Sebastian Stan, Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Benicio del Toro, and others too numerous to name. Josh Brolin effectively plays the evil Thanos and creates a strong adversary who allows power to corrupt his soul.

The CGI is impressive throughout. Less effective is the editing and handling of transitions. At times, the well staged combat scenes intercut some of the action. Too much planet hopping interrupts the overall flow and gives the film an episodic vibe...the sum of the parts never making a very cohesive whole. Yes, there is much to hold one spellbound with its big budget cast of thousands approach and the film's fine production values, but all the rigmarole and commotion almost exhausts the moviegoer rather than enthralls.

One eagerly awaits for the fractured teams of heroes to meld into an unstoppable force, but it never truly materializes and the cliffhanger ending is far from satisfying. This long and epic film literally comes to a stop with no clear denouncement, taking Mr. Lightyear's phrase and deciding not to settle anything soon, just looking beyond...to the next installment, with no end in sight.

In Avengers: Infinity War, the war rages on and on...and the Marvel franchise lives long and prospers...to infinity.",8
The Payoff Is Worth It!,5 May 2018,"After 10 years of Marvel's Cinematic Universe, it's great to see that Disney and Marvel have still yet to give a truly terrible addition to the universe - with a huge ensemble cast which is balanced beautifully - you will laugh, cry and remain on the edge of your seats from the Marvel Studios logo to end-credit scene, which I seriously suggest waiting for!

If you like the 'superhero' genre, you will love the 19th entry into the MCU.",9
A breath of fresh air for marvel,29 April 2018,"Though all marvel films up to this point have been entertaining crowd pleasers this one took lots of risks and had many permanent consequences. Something that I personally have been wanting from these marvel movies for a long time. Though it is far from perfect, it's flaws can easily be over looked.",9
AMAZING!!!!!,28 April 2018,"This movie was fantastic! By far my favorite Marvel movie! Iron Man, Captain America, and Thor we're all bada**... so was Spider-Man and Doctor Strange.

Had it's serious moments and great fight scenes, definitely had its fair share of jokes and wise cracks!

Absolutely loved this movie! WAKANDA FOREVER!

Definitely kind of a Thanos Origin story.. and just so you know there IS a post credit scene, people in my theater heard there wasn't one and they left but I'm a true marvel fan so obviously I held in my urine and sat through that long list of credits and I'm glad I did!",10
"Marvel reaches heights of infinty, and beyond",1 May 2018,"The definition of Marvel is ""to be affected with wonder and astonishment, as at something surprising or extraordinary"". Disregarding puns aside, 'Avengers: Infinity War' is the perfect encapsulation of its brand's namesake, as feelings of sheer 'wonder and astonishment' is what I experienced while watching the film. Somehow the Russo Brothers have managed to create a huge cinematic event that lives up to all the hype. This is one of the best MCU films yet, and this isn't just because of its size and spectacle. It still uses elements of the Marvel formula, so to speak, which have worked so well before, being bombastic action sequences and humorous character interactions, and unsurprisingly dials them up to 11. But then, these elements are applied and seamlessly blended with a tone which isn't exactly dark, but definitely desperate, which brings about a larger sense of danger and consequence that has never been done in one of these films before. While there isn't much of a plot outside of trying to stop Thanos from assembling the Infinity Gauntlet, it's the character interactions I mentioned before that Marvel usually does so well that keeps the audience captivated. And somehow, the Russos, along with screenwriters Christopher Marcus and Stephen McFeely, pull it off so well. This film has a gargantuan cast, and it manages to combine the differing tones from the various franchises without feeling cluttered. The duo of Robert Downey Jr and Benedict Cumberbatch as Iron Man and Doctor Strange makes complete sense, as their wit, sarcasm and goatees create great potential for friction and disagreement. An enthusiastic and awe-ridden Spider-Man also tags along with them, and Tom Holland makes it seem he's constantly amazed to witness the events taking place just like the audience. The campy cosmic styles of Thor and the Guardians of the Galaxy mesh together exceptionally and undoubtedly deliver the best uses of comedy. And the majority of the cast from 'Civil War', along with a few other additions engage in an awesome climactic battle in the 'Black Panther' setting of Wakanda. Naturally, not a lot of these characters understandably go through much development, which was a miracle in itself to see in Civil War, but a few do. This being Hulk, Vision, Scarlet Witch, Gamora, and especially Chris Hemsworth as Thor, who has further transformed his once disengaging character until 'Ragnarok', to probably the best Avenger, who has the most legitimate reasons to be engaged in this conflict. But the best character is the big bad himself, Thanos. Josh Brolin delivers an incredible performance of this character, who has been built up and hyped for so many years now, and he completely subverted my expectations. He is not the loud-spoken, egotistic, emotionless monster that had been previously portrayed in his cameos, who seemed to lack any form of motivation outside of a thirst for universal conquest. Instead, he is now a soft-spoken, sardonic, charismatic but fearsome individual, who has surprisingly altruistic motives for collecting the Infinity Stones and using them for universal genocide, that actually makes reasonable sense. And because of this, he is faced with certain challenges that he has to go through in order to achieve his goals, which demonstrates the raw determination of this character that makes him all the more compelling to watch. Some of my personal favourite scenes were just dialogue between him and one other character, which effectively utilises Brolin's acting skills to show Thanos' more emotional and sensitive side, which I found more interesting, that overall creates what is probably the best comic-book villain since Chris Nolan's 'Dark Knight' Trilogy. The structural features on display are mainly on-point. Trent Opaloch returns as the cinematographer from the Russos' previous 'Captain America' films, but this time suitably cuts down on the shaky-cam techniques which work well with the grounded tone of those films. Instead, there is a naturally more vibrant and poppy colour palette unlike his previous dull and graded cinematography. And every shot which encompassed this is just simply gigantic, which fits greatly with the enormous stakes of the film. Alan Silvestri makes a welcome return as the composer, and while there aren't any memorable tracks outside of the recurring motifs from the first 'Avengers', the score as a whole is noticeably emotive and synchs up well with the majority of the scenes, which creates more of an aural impact than the forgettable background noise in 'Age of Ultron'. The visual effects are very impressive, especially the motion capture used for Thanos, as it effectively picks a lot of subtle facial expressions Brolin uses to perform, that make him seem all the more realistic. And while I'd say the CGI does not reach the levels of visual splendour shown in 'Guardians Vol. 2', for the most part, they successfully merge with the live action, and work as a major improvement over the PS2 graphics in 'Black Panther'. Despite my gushing, there are certain issues on display. I felt like the script allowed for characters to make choices and actions which were either extremely convenient or inconvenient so that the story could proceed accordingly without having to grind to a sudden, albeit logical halt. And being the nineteenth instalment in this cinematic universe, there are going to be obvious continuity errors, as I found some events in previous films, especially 'Ragnarok', did not lead into this as well as they could have. And I already mentioned the size of the ensemble cast, unfortunately, means a few characters are dismissed from having actual development, especially the other villains, Thanos' Black Order, who don't contribute much except interesting designs and opponents for the Avengers. But this is only Part 1, so I believe the few heroes who felt left behind outside of fighting will get more time to develop properly in Part 2. Thus, 'Avengers: Infinity War' epitomises how to culminate a cinematic universe with now a decade of history, which is not showing any signs of franchise fatigue. And yet somehow, it also manages to be a shocking, thrilling, grandiose event, where it becomes the prime example of pure popcorn cinema. This is why these films appeal to the masses, and so they should.",9
Good film but...??,18 November 2019,I want this film to make a build up to us cause there is some people does not watch all marvel films and they did not understand this film because of that,9
10 years wasted,11 August 2018,"We been waiting 10 years for this? So predictable, looks more a comedian movie then a action movie,",5
Puts all other movies to shame,28 April 2018,"This movie takes the past 10 years of MCU history and brings together all of our favourite heroes. During the movie we are put into different situations with our heroes, but this is a thanos movie ( Kevin Feige wasn't kidding). We learn lots about Thanos through the course of this movie and see why he is trying to destroy half the universe. The heroes in the movie were amazing with Spiderman getting his new suit to Drax throwing in punch lines all over the place. Interactions between characters was amazing also seeing all these different personalities interact and how they fight together as a team. This movie is very dark with lots of death, but the heroes still make us laugh throughout the movie Overall, without spoiling the movie we don't stray too far away from the comics and this movie is really a part 1 to next years avengers 4. You will be on the edge of your seat this whole movie to the end of the credits. Mind blowing movie 10/10",10
Amazing movie!,10 July 2019,Well!! I loved this movie. Amazing effects! One of the most epic showdown movie!,9
The Best Superhero ever made,19 March 2019,"This is by far the best superhero that has ever been made, even beating Dark Knight. In fact, even the Villain is better than the Joker. Let me say that the acting in the movie is top notch, especially where it needs to be. The look on RDJ's face, the determination on caps face when facing the army, the resolve in Thanos's eyes. The movie lacks in CGI for sure, but there is so much soul in this movie and it will make you think for days after you have seen it. This movie is the high point of the MCU, how can it ever get better?",10
Infinity War is Not a Movie to Skip Over,13 March 2019,"17 movies in the Marvel universe were the setup, and now ""Infinity War"" is the ultimate payoff. Marvel leaves your classic superheroes and their quests behind and rapidly plunges into a much darker story of ultimate sacrifice that is much more deep than any before, the quest of Thanos.

""Infinity War"" is the story of Thanos and his journey to collect 6 infinity stones, gems that possess incredible power with no equal. If he succeeds he can wipe half of all life from the universe with the snap of his fingers, Thanos' idea of how to create ultimate peace. By lowering the population in a mass genocide, everything wrong such as poverty, hunger, and all else can be solved with a new mass abundance of resources that will create ultimate peace, but it takes the ultimate cost. The protagonists we have all come to love or hate so far must join from across the stars in a effort to stop Thanos to save them all. Failure would be catastrophic.

That's just the plot. The movie truly shines in its use of character building, comic relief, and it omnipresent themes of family and sacrifice. To see jaw dropping effects and environments, characters unfold within astonishing action scenes of heroism, and to see them also suffer from their previous mistakes which haunt them makes for an astounding spectacle to behold. Trust me when I say, 'You don't want to miss this one.'

The characters in the movie have been kept greatly the same and you can still see them change in their changing environments, which is amazing. I really love to see what MARVEL will do with each new instalment into the franchise and now we finally get our first pay-off. We can see all of are beloved heros and villian come together and it's just amazing to watch and awe at. To see all the characters come together for a massive battle made me really giddy sitting there in the theater. It moved me to the edge of my seat, but that's the surface of it, the plot. Each character has their own outstanding personality and they interact with others in there own way, and that makes me love this movie even more. Characters aren't just along for the ride, they all show who they are and that attention to detail in every moment is truly an amazing piece of work. Personalities are not glossed over for action, but expressed upon and even bring out new themes that wouldn't have been apparent such as family and loss as mentioned before. Another major point with their personality is the comic relief, and it wouldn't be MARVEL without it. The characters are funny, and not just filler for a boring plot. The jokes don't take away from the quality, they only add to it. This is different in a good way compared to many others. Even in solo sections or in scenes where multiple people are together, the personality of each character is very apparent. Star Lord, Spider-man, and many others keep their quips and charm and even others provide wanted humor just from their bluntness or lack of awareness make for a funny moment or two. Its funny to see characters meet each other and express that. I would write a joke, but I'm keeping spoiler friendly here. I just want to express how they creators crafted them together and it doesn't feel fake or needed. It perfectly placed and I'm glad to have it.

Another key difference and major change in this movie is the main character. No it's not one of the heroes, but the villain Thanos. This movie focuses on his journey, his quest, his goals, his regrets, not anyone else. Sure they develop the other characters, but he's the focus. Now don't make the mistake of thinking that he's the protagonist, but he still is focused on. It's a super enticing idea. This makes for a really interesting impact on the movie as a whole too. It subverts expectations and feels exiting to the audience since no-one else does this and no-one else has ever before. (At least not really) This just adds to the ever building pile of greatness for this movie.

To conclude, this movie is truly spectacular. I've never seen and probably will never see anything like it again. Years of work and detail to smash into an ultimate plot, impossible twists and surprises, great story and characters, a villain as the main character, intense ideas and themes, they all make this movie an all time great. There have been movies with similar elements before, a villainous main character such as Maleficent (but not really), great action scenes like many others such as movies like Star Wars or The Dark Knight, great themes of bonding and sacrifice, but none before now have put them all together. All MARVEL fans can appreciate this movie, and you can even if your new. You can see this movie by itself and still be blown away, though I recommend watching the others so you understand who everybody is. I can't recommend this movie enough. I could ramble on about it all day and night, but the main point here is you'll never see anything like it, and you don't want to miss out. You need to see Infinity War, and you won't regret it.",9

Blew my expectations away,29 April 2018,"I've been a big fan of the mcu for many years. But after the second avengers movie I was kind of worried that infinity was going to be bad. But none the less it blew me out of the water.

It had fantastic suprises amazing build up and an ending that was complete but still left you on a cliffhanger. Thanos was an amazing villain with believable motives. The only problem I had with him is I feel like we didn't see him much. Some of the heroes weren't really developed in the movie at all but the Russo brothers did a great job non the less.

I was debating whether to give this a 8 or a 9 but I chose a 9 because it felt like it deserved a high score. The only real flaw was some character development and some scenes that were too bloated but it was a given taken how big the movie was. But I went a 9 mainly because it's a film that had a large weight on its shoulders that still managed to blow all expectations.",9

Avengers: Infinity War,18 March 2021,"There are six Infinity Stones, the film explains, Some are spread across the universe, but half of them are on Earth, where they've play The film can't spread around its camera time in equal measure, but it does give all the characters an equal shot at despair. A decade of films have led up to Thanos, and Avengers: Infinity War delivers on that threat with a film that upends the entire fabric of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. No character is safe from the far-reaching implications of his actions, and it's impressive to see just how dark Marvel is willing to go for this story. Even the biggest fan favorites are truly vulnerable, and the movie reinforces that idea - relentlessly, at times - as it sprints toward its final stunning moments. By the time the credits roll, audiences will no doubt be aghast at just how far the Avengers have fallen.ed significant roles in past MCU movies. Thanos is trying to collect all of them,This is a comic book universe, after all, and the fact that Infinity War is able to embrace this darkness in the first place is a wonder. The only real crime is that audiences will have to wait until 2019 to see the conclusion",8
Fun to watch watch again,13 April 2019,Definitely a lot of action in this movie a lot of fight scenes going on in 3 different places really liked it,9
Everything I hoped it to be and even better!,28 April 2018,"""Dread it, run from it. Destiny still arrives.""

I remember walking into the theatre to watch 'The Avengers' in 2012 and completely awed by it. After that, I watched all the Marvel movies in theatre (except Spiderman). I saw Thanos' smirk at the end and thought we'd see him in the sequel very soon. It took 6 goddamn years. And now I've watched it, the movie that all the previous ones were leading up to.

The expectations were already high and I was doubting how they were going to top Civil War which was my favourite Marvel movie. I was glad the Russo's directed it because they did a MARVELous job.

From the first scene till the last one, I was on the edge of the seat. It did everything it should and even more. It wasn't an Avengers movie, it was Thanos' movie. We already learnt about all the other good guys, so they focused the most on Thanos. And Thanos became my favourite MCU villain. Not only was he scary but also had emotions with some of the characters. He's not just a villain who wants to destroy, he had his reasons. (That's what I loved about Magneto too).

BFI IMAX 3D felt like a rollercoaster ride that I would love to try again and again. The visual effects were spectacular, much better than Black Panther. The action scenes were some of the best I've seen. There were so many scenes during which the entire theatre just cheered and clapped. Even I clapped until my hands hurt. It was that exciting. The score, of course, is amazing.

The ending. I was just shocked. (It's like GoT + Superhero movies). I praise them for having the balls to do it. I doubt even DC would do it. Bravo for that. I was satisfied with it but I do think that's not the real ending. But I'm excited to see how they're gonna pull it off.

Overall, it wasn't just a movie, it was an experience. So far, I couldn't find any major flaws that affected my experience. I had ton of fun. That's what matters. I'm going rewatch it 'infinite' times. Again, I love movies in general, and I'm not a huge Marvel fan. But seeing those characters in a movie like this were so thrilling. I'd rate 10/10 because it was a hugely difficult job to pull off and they did it.",10
This is GOLD!!!!!,6 November 2019,"Ok, so nobody will ever read this, and in all probability, it'll just be lost among the crowd of reviews, but it's worth a chance, right?

As always, we sat thru the credits which unfortunately showed more of the same coming.",5

Best superhero movie of 2018,7 March 2019,"Infinity War is a fine summation of the MCU so far. Thanos is the best enemy, he has reason and motivation in his destruction. Josh Brolin was the best choice for his voice. Every hero has his/her part in this movie. The worst thing about it was the end, the movie has a very good cliffhanger, i can't wait for the second part. If you are a superhero or comic fan it is a must see movie, but to understand it, you have to watch every MCU movie from the begining (until Black Panther).",8

OROROMUNROE,30 March 2019,"If you love the MCU, you will definatly love this film. The Russo brothers really depicted all the characters meetings perfectly, with a decent level of comedy and thrills. At not one point did i look at my phone throughout this entire film amd toilet breaks were a myth, the duration of the film was perfect timing, nothing felt stretched or cut too abrubt. Not only is this a film for you grown geeks but also kids aswell. Something my son will definitly have to endure. LOVE ITT!!",9
Another superhero movie,2 August 2018,"Avengers Infinity War wasn't a film I was overly bothered about seeing, but my friend drags me to all of the superhero films, none of which I've found to be very interesting. Since the first Iron Man film (which was a pleasant surprise) these films have become more and more formulaic. This one has huge ambition by throwing every single Marvel superhero into the mix. If you love these characters then this is probably all your cinematic dreams come true. However if you're just a fan of good movies then this might well leave you cold.

On the positive side of things, it's very impressive that the filmmakers have assembled so many characters and given them all something to do, but it comes across like Wacky Races with 50 characters. It's kind of fun for a while but as more and more characters are introduced it becomes harder to care. And the plot, well, it's a problem. On the one hand they've kept it really simple by having one major bad guy (with a couple of sidekicks who show up now and again). And as is usually the case in these films, it's a maguffin chase. All of these big budget franchises have been using this lazy plot line for ages now. Thanos (the villain) needs to find a bunch of coloured stones to wear on his glove. And if he gets them all then it will mean the end of the world, universe, blah blah (same thing as the ring in LOTR, or the cube in Transformers, and most other big movies like this where everyone is after a magical artefact). The problem is, these magic stones don't really do anything. They just have nice names and the bad guy has to find them at any cost. That's your whole plot in a nutshell.

So to try and keep the audience engaged the filmmakers have decided that an overbearing soundtrack will tell you how to feel at every crucial moment in the film. And it's almost always the same thing - Character X is about to die (cue tragic sad music). A long drawn out sequence takes place where X says goodbye to someone. These scenes (which are repeated every ten minutes or so) either end with another avenger showing up to save the day (cue triumphant music) or X is killed / left to die by the bad guys. But because this is a superhero film and most of these characters are big cash cows, you know that they're not really dead. They're coming back, sometimes twenty minutes later. After a while the constant ""don't let me die"" scenes get beyond ridiculous, but I suppose if you're a kid and haven't seen this done a million times before, it might be ""amazing"". On the other hand, if you're an adult and you've seen this done enough times to know how it plays out, this becomes tedious really quickly. And the overbearing soundtrack telling you how to feel at all times, smacks of desperation from a studio that knows they have too many characters in the film and not enough time to make a casual viewer care about them, so the manipulative music is added in instead to trick you into feeling whatever they want you to feel.

Even though I didn't enjoy this film, I think they've done a great job of making it look fantastic. And every character gets their allotment of screentime without the pace of the story ever slowing down, but what you have is a 2 hour 15 minute action film with no downtime, probably in the hopes that younger viewers won't notice the absence of a proper story.

To summarise, this is great for fans, but probably boring for anyone else.",4

Avengers: Infinity War,27 April 2018,"...It's really hard to talk about this movie without giving everything or something HUGE away. What I can tell you is the bare basics of what you will be witnessing. And that is as follows: Everything you've seen, everything you know, is wrong. Your expectations are wrong. You are not prepared for what this movie has to throw at you. YOU'RE NOT. I surely wasn't; I found myself realizing my mouth was gaped open multiple times. Avengers: Infinity War is the cultivation of everything Marvel has built and it executed it almost flawlessly. There are only two flaws that can be found here. One, the pacing is a bit wonky at parts, as scenes cut away and tones can be shifted. Two, some characters don't get the spotlight that you might want them to. But these flaws are easily forgiven. As this movie delivers on EVERYTHING. The action is exceptional. The emotion is POWERFUL. The music by Silvestri hits you in the gut with every note. The story is at odds, taking turns in ways that you will never see coming, not even with clairvoyance. Now, I can't say much, but what I will say, is that Josh Brolin has given us, quite possibly, one of the greatest villains in cinematic history. He is scary, compassionate, charismatic, but most of all, empathetic. The Russo Brothers also directed their asses off and made their best work yet. That's all I can really say. You need to go into this movie blind like I did, because by the end you won't know what's coming next, you'll be speechless. So until the next Avengers movie arrives, I'll watch it, then watch it again, because it's the only movie we got for a while.",10

MCU LEGACY AND A MASTERPIECE,30 April 2018,Its everything you but its more than that can eyes can see absorb !!!!!!,10
The Beginning of the End(game),6 August 2019,"Unless you've been living under a rock for the past decade or so you might have heard of a little production company by the name of Marvel Studios. Creating motion picture adaptations of Marvel Comics properties, they've had a surprisingly consistent track record for delivering satisfying big budget superhero entertainment. The fact that they also managed to tie everything together into a cohesive shared universe is something that frankly hadn't been seen to that extent in movies before. All of the care that went into these productions culminated in 2018's ""Avengers: Infinity War"" and its direct sequel, 2019's ""Avengers: Endgame"". Together they proved to be a fitting capper to Marvel's journey that began with ""Iron Man"" in 2008.

First of all, it's important to recognize that this movie is part one of a two part story. I didn't realize this when I originally watched the movie, so I was somewhat disappointed that the story wasn't brought to a resolution. Later on, when rewatching the movie ahead of the concluding chapter, I got a better appreciation of what the movie was meant to be.

As had been hinted at for years, ""Infinity War"" finally marked the entrance of Thanos into the Marvel universe as a major villain. He seeks to acquire the six Infinity Stones, which will make him powerful enough to restore balance to the universe... by laying half of it to waste. Naturally, our heroes the Avengers aren't about to just let that happen. However, Thanos's power increases with the acquisition of each new stone, so stopping him becomes a race against time.

For a movie that's the culmination of 19 previous films, a memorable villain was a must. Luckily, Josh Brolin's portrayal of Thanos is one of the most memorable in the Marvel canon. No doubt much of the credit goes to the original creator of the character (Jim Starlin) but the fact is that Thanos gives the impression that he's someone who could give the Avengers a run for their money. In fact, he's such a formidable foe that the threat of defeat is more palpable than in any previous Marvel movie. That his motivations are also interesting from a philosophical point of view is another point in the movie's favour.

Having a compelling villain is of course a crucial element in any superhero movie but in this case the sheer scale of the undertaking is impressive in and of itself. Featuring a star-studded cast of Marvel veterans in the various heroic roles, it's amazing that the producers managed to keep the shared universe alive this long just to be able to put this movie together in the first place. That they managed to keep the movie from collapsing under the weight of its stars is another testament to their commitment to quality. Despite a fairly hefty two and a half hour runtime, the movie is nicely paced and gives a reasonable amount of screentime to all involved. My only real complaint is that the final act's impact is somewhat muted by the utter improbability that certain characters will be gone for good since they already had sequels in the pipeline. Surely they could have stuck to characters whose fate was less certain?

""Infinity War"" may not be the type of movie I'd watch for awards-worthy work on either side of the camera but as a feat of production I think that it and its (superior) sequel are nearly unparalleled. It makes me wonder if ""Endgame"" might be shown some love at the next Oscars ceremony. I mean, ""Black Panther"" was nominated for Best PIcture and that was arguably more about cultural impact than the actual merits of the production (though I wouldn't have argued if Michael B. Jordan was nominated). In any case, Marvel fans don't need any convincing to watch this movie. For others, this probably isn't the best starting point.",8
A good marvel movie,19 May 2018,,8
Great again AVENGERS,18 October 2019,"This film is way better than endgame. The actions are better, the writings better the dialogues better and better the cgi is better More shocks. Each frame, each scene does not let you get bored. The movie has made me feel things that I haven't about a movie in a very long time and I'm definitely very excited.",9
Falling asleep in the middle of the movie,7 October 2018,Very confusing story. In my personal opinion Thor should have long hair. Captain America should not have a beard and wear his uniform. Hulk should be more powerful than what was shown on this movie. Ironman's nano tech suit is a joke. The Avengers seem to have no powers in this movie.,3
"Overwhelming, humorous, emotional, stunning, wow Marvel!",26 April 2018,"The past months my expectations for this movie were increasing and increasing until the point I was worried wether the movie could live up to it and, oh boy, it sure did!

Infinity War delivers a great job with combining all these superheroes into a spectacular though emotional collage. Which is a difficult job because every character could be banished into a smaller role because there's simply not more screentime to give. But no, that didn't happen, the story doesn't dissappoint and even contains some special surprises, some more subtile than others. Thumbs up for the directors and the writers to master this collision of all built up Marvel storylines.

What got me the most personally was the deeper dig into the backgrond story of Thanos and Gamora and their relationship, because it brought more depth to the movie. This review contains no spoilers, especially a sensitive subject with this movie, but the ending only hungers for the next suite... just one year to go.

A must see for every superheroe fanatic, movielover or just the periodic movietheater visiter. So I hope you can use the same adjectives as I did in the title!",9

Had me at the edge of my seat the whole time during the movie........,28 April 2018,"I literally had my mouth wide open when I saw the end credits... I want to know when is the next part coming out and how this is going to end.

But do keep in mind one thing.... you should be in line with the previous superhero movies to get through Avengers: IW... else your are lost.... Thanos... Thanos... Thanos... the super villain...",10
MCU has sorted all of this out and all we have to do is pony up the money.,7 October 2019,"Ready? Here we go:

1. I love Avengers 1 & 2 and I was saddened a bit that Joss Whedon wasn't coming back as director for the 3rd installment. But after seeing Winter Soldier and Civil War, the Russo Brothers were the best men for the job and sure enough they didn't disappoint.

2. The most impressive thing about the movie is how it was able to fit more than 20 major characters in, each getting the appropriate screen time (Black Panther gets just enough considering we just saw him a couple of months ago), nothing feels rushed and/or badly edited (Justice League, Suicide Squad, anyone?)

3. While it is a Russo Brothers movie, we still get the Taiki Waititi Thor, the James Gunn Guardians of the Galaxy and all the others seamlessly interwoven that's why the running time of 149 minutes of excitement, joy and sadness just quickly went by.

4. I have to agree with the critics that while the story isn't it's main strength, in my opinion the movie still works because A) it was setup nicely by the previous MCU installments and B) each and every character was perfectly cast. From Tom Holland's Peter Parker (sorry Tobey Maguire) all the way to Josh Brolin's Thanos, no one seems out of place or trying hard to fit in.

5. Speaking of Thanos, he was so well-written and played that he almost got my buy-in on his desire to eradicate half of life in the universe in order to restore balance and allow the planet to heal and recuperate.

I remember when news broke out about the first Avenger movie, I counted the days until I saw it in the cinema. Now, it's just 367 days left until Avengers 4 is released. I was thinking after this story arc, can they still top themselves? What else can they do that we haven't seen already? While there are other story lines that are worth telling, will they be able to recast the actors just as well? All things considered these are all good problems to have, they are still problems just the same. But with 19 movies already out and plenty more in the pipeline, I think the MCU has sorted all of this out and all we have to do is pony up the money.",9
A great movie,27 April 2018,"A gigantic, monumental film in every aspect, with epic battles, absurd development and spectacular villains, ""Avengers - Endless War"" is not only characterized as the best film of Marvel, the film also presages to be one of the best hero movies already made, and the only reason for not being such, is that in the end, we little believe what we see, because we know, that the situation will be reversed in the second, after all, it's a hero movie. The script that tells the story of Thanos, a kind of man who intends to give mercy to the world killing half of its population, thus ending, with the shortage, Thanos is a hero of absurd development, and beats head-on with Nolan's joker, as being the best villain in the movie of heroes, putting different universes and countless heroes in the same universe, the directors are successful in embedding several stories, not always with a perfect rhythm or the perfect excuse for, but, it does not get boring, nor gets to leave one or the other too much to corner, which is a merit grade. The cruelest thing about the film is that we understand that Thanos wants to end half of the universe, the character does not think of it as genocide, but an act of mercy to the suffering of people, and we can not support it, but we understand its actions, Thanos is not a sovereign and robotic villain, he is human, perhaps and strangely, the most human of the film, and watching coldly, perhaps the hero of the film, this characterization of Thanos and the development of it, is simply brilliant and magnificent. Technically the film is a show of special effects, and directing action scenes, great choreographies and frames, and cleverly putting battles in separate areas, not creating a big mess in a single center with all the heroes, even so, sometimes it seems that something came out in the editing, the transition in many moments is completely inorganic, just like your photo revesa and changes according to the core on screen, although this is not necessarily bad, it's just a touch of visual marking, well adjusted soundtrack, jokes in the right moments and well-balanced drama, Avengers infinite war is a well directed and finished film. The cast is fine, nothing too spectacular, even because no one has a lot of screen space, but they all play their role well, with a small highlight for Robert Downey Jr and Tom Holland, in isolation, """" Avengers - Infinite War ""is a spectacular movie , with small problems, it's true, but still spectacular, which does not give him a soul of genius and unique, is that we know that his story will continue, and everything shown so far will change, intrinsically, this disrupts our experience with this but nevertheless, contemplate the best film of Marvel.",8
THE BEST MOVIE BY FAR,11 October 2018,"I was left speechless, shocked, surprised and i was really looking forward to the next part. It's a complete movie as well as a part of a whole at the same time. Must watch, but make sure you've watch previous movies to fully enjoy it.",10
Ending,26 June 2018,The ending left everyone wondering what they had just wasted 2 hours of their life on. The first half was very good!,4
Epic,5 May 2018,"I'm not not a hard core follower of super hero films in general. So that group I'm sure will tear me down. But with that said, I will say I am a 'Gardens of the Galaxy' and 'Thor' junkie. I really can watch either of those movies over and over again. Entertaining and funny. So I didn't know what to expect with 'Infinity War'. My opinion, EPIC. Well done. As is expected you leave room for further expansion of the story line that will/should feed off into the existing standalone movies. You can only cover so much in one movie.",10
You will not be disappointed,1 May 2018,"The Russo brothers have done it again. They have successfully brought together a massive roster of characters created by different writers into one jaw-dropping,action packed and exciting film. Infinity War is the near-perfect reflection of everything Marvel has done in the last 10 years.

3 years after the events of Civil War, the Avengers are now seperated. But when Thanos- their biggest rival shows up, the former allies have to set aside their differences and stand together against Thanos with the help of the Guardians and the people of Wakanda.

The film's plot was rather simple, but it had no major plot holes and was very easy to get abreast of. It was the characters that formed this blockbuster. I loved how the Russos set up the storylines for each chracters in the film. All of them shined and you will remember every single character. The acting was obviously fantastic. But the best performance in this film goes to Josh Brolin. He successfully betrayed one of Marvel's greatest villian yet and prooved why Thanos is the biggest and the baddest villain in the MCU. He will make Keaton's Vulture and Jordan's Killmonger look meh by comparison. The best part is how different characters are set in different tones. For example, when the scene moves to the Avengers, everything gets a bit dramactic and more serious whereas every time the Guardians show up its all laugh-out-loud.That along with the epic soundtrack formed a great amotsphere in every shot. However, the Black Order was somewhat a disappointment in this film. They had very little screen time and was not as frightening as we saw in the trailers.

The only negative part of the film is probalbly the tempo. The film was a bit too fast-paced, which was hard to catch up with sometimes. But I think it's understandable as there are over 70 major characters in this film. The filmmakes wanted to make sure that everyone has a spot in this epic showdown.

There's just so much to say about this film, but I will have to pass because I do not want to spoil anything. Infinity War may not be the best film Marvel has made and it has some problems here and there, but it is a satisfying ending to a 10-year period of Marvel domination. It's definitely worth 2 hour 36 mins of your life. I would recommend seeing it in theaters at least 2 times because you may miss out on a lot of interseting details",9
The MCU Transforms,12 November 2018,"The Avengers, no matter which way you look at it is an incredible achievement. The 6th official entry in the MCU which was a multi million cinematic experiment 4 years and 5 previous Marvel films in the making for its eventual leadup of its iconic superhero characters became a critical and commercial success which pioneered the superhero crossover film, revived the superhero genre and rewrote pop culture in a way that is still being felt today even after its release nearly 7 years ago now. The overall genre and emotional tone of The Avengers along with every other modern Marvel movie with its near perfect blend between drama and serious storylines but with light hearted comedy and great action sequences. It's been able to get everyone together, not just the comic fans due to Marvel's now infamous MCU formula with its massively wide spreading and universal appeal to anyone who has any interest in Marvel superheros and being entertained by a light-hearted action comedy blockbuster which has proven time and time again to be right with every Marvel film since with the Marvel Cinematic Universe now becoming the highest grossing film franchise in history with over 1 billion dollars.

Now with Infinity War out, the third and possibly final Avengers film. The formula is now starting to become tested. No Marvel film before Infinity War has really tried to be dark, but the MCU is changing and now after seeing the film and where it went emotionally and storywise and have no idea where it's going to go after the way it ended, which is good. Marvel has listened to fans complaints of how previous villains were not serious or intimidating enough and how no main characters have ever actually been killed off with the feeling that they might not ever come back, this movie changes all that.

Infinity War is not predictable. It's surprising and entertaining in the first half, then it hurts you and leaves you cold. Thanos was an incredible and brutal in this film as was the type of villain that Marvel Studios really needed at this point and I think they did an incredible job with the character aswell as all the choices he made and all the things he did in this movie, he was a better villain than by any right he needed to be. His CGI was great as well.

It's a lot harder to talk about this film in a review than you think, and what it means for the future of Marvel Studios apart from saying it's my favourite Comic Book film of the decade so far since The Winter Soilder and complete new milestone for Marvel. Not just for Marvel, but for Comic Book Films as a whole. The MCU will grow in new ways unlike ever seen before because of this movie, and I'm looking forward to seeing how Captain Marvel is going to do that. I have no idea what's going to happen next, I don't read the comics",9
Truly epic,29 April 2018,"This film does justice to the characters, the cinematic universe, the source material, and most importantly, the fans who've supported the MCU and have been waiting for this specific story to begin to unfurl.

It's a THRILLING cinematic experience. The first part of a five hour biblical epic in the skin of a galactic comic book space opera. This is studio film-making on the narrative and production scale of Peter Jackson's Middle Earth movies and old studio epics like Ben-Hur, Cleopatra, El CID, and The Ten Commandments (only with loads more CGI).

Selfishly , I only wished that the story could somehow have been presented in all of its five hour glory. Truth be told, I hate having to wait another year for its conclusion.

But anyway, here's a spoiler free summation of my thoughts:

The plot of the movie is pretty basic: Thanos comes to earth and a bunch of other planets in search of the stones needed to assemble the Infinity Gauntlet. The Avengers must stop him. You already knew that. But the execution was nearly flawless. Marvel studios and all the filmmakers did an amazing job of making a very coherent storyline from the countless characters and threads the movie had to weave together and converge with Thanos, played with fantastic intelligence and subtlety by Josh Brolin. Thanos isn't you typical mustachio twirling scene chewing bad guy. He's surprisingly quite and sensible giving him a really calm, almost Hannibal lector like sense of menace. And he looks great.

Actually all of the actors in the movie, namely the heroes, gave solid performances. But the real standouts for me were Chris Hemsworth, whose really has come into his own in the last year as Thor, and Benedict Cumberbatch as Doctor Strange. Those two characters have some of the best scenes in the movie and have some of the best repartee. On that note:

The humor in the movie mostly fell flat, even when it was amusing. The stakes of the movie were just way too big, the tension just too high, for me to laugh. But that's just me.

The action sequences were freaking phenomenal right from the gate. This movies action does NOT disappoint. And the movie doesn't go cheap with Thanos fighting...I'll just stop myself right there :) What was much less exciting was the action involving Thanos' henchman. But that may be due to the fact that the filmmakers were very inconsistent with there power level and the power level of some of the other Avengers in the numerous fight sequences. Nothing takes me out of an action scene quicker than when characters who've I've seen portrayed on film, in some cases numerous times, have their powers nerfed or juiced up. In movies, like an many other things, consistency is key. But again, that's just me.

Now...at this stage I don't think mentioning that there were casualties is a spoiler. But i won't get into specifics, either in terms of a number or a name. What I will say is that even if you're a casual MCU fan like I am, and you've seen all the movies, nothing will, or at least should, shock you.

The biggest shock is in the way the filmmakers handle the key moment in the film... its darkest hour so to speak. That small moment, one simple action that was cleverly set up throughout the film, was incredibly poetic and haunting. I'm not lying when I say that you could literally feel the air leave the theater when it happened. Absolutely splendid. Made the movie for me. What followed in the last five minutes or so was a mix of good and okay. Nothing surprising to me.

That's really where the fact that the movie is only part one of a larger story came back to hurt my enjoyment of it. I would also say that the nature of Thanos' goal, which I won't spoil, also played a part in that. The movie tried to tug on my emotional heart strings but the loss Thanos inflected on the heroes simply didn't cut close enough to the spine of the heroes to really make me feel anything. I'm dancing around this point but in general, the better you know someone, the more you're emotionally invested in them, and the more it hurts when there gone. I'll leave it at that.

I'll close with stating that if your even a casual MCU fan you'll really enjoy Infinity War. It's a magnificent big screen sci-fi/space opera epic...just don't expect it to give you closure or really big emotional payoffs. Infinity War is as stated at the start, a part one film...and a damned good one at that. It's thoroughly entertaining and brilliantly sets the table for what promises to be an even grander Infinity War Part II... I mean Avengers 4 ;)",8

Best,28 April 2018,,10
Avengers Infinity War is more than an epic and a masterpiece.,28 April 2018,"Avengers: Infinity War is more than an epic, a masterpiece, an emotional ride, visual extravaganza and cinematic excellence. Infinity War is a dream come true for Marvel fans from all over the world. Infinity war is not just a cinema, it's an experience, 3 years of await, 10 years of exceptional journey and 18 movies of long thread lead to this. Everything about Infinity war is spellbinding and mind boggling. Hats off to the Russo Brothers(Anthony and Joe Russo) for bringing Infinity war into life and meeting up to the fans expectations and the hype, their vision is extraordinary, you will know once you see the movie, how great their direction was and characters build up. They just nailed it. Half of the total credits must go to Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely for the amazing screenplay. The movie starts off with Thor: Ragnarok's post credit scene and ends up with ""end of everything"". Right from the word go, every scene was intriguing,engaging and thrilling. Every superhero in the movie has got their own space to showcase their powers and skills, you will scream for every scene, I promise, even if you are not a fan of a particular superhero, you will surely scream for their elevations. There are many sacrifices in this movie which are quite emotional and they are so meaningful. Even the mad titan himself has to sacrifice something to gain something. Thanos is not just a villain, he has his own character which has a lot of emotional depth. You will feel sorry for him in few moments which causes so much pain to him. His life, his children, his sacrifice and his goal everything means so much to him. He also respects his opponents even though they took out the blood from his face. Thanos says ""I hope they remember you"" to Tony, this scene is just awesome and you are gonna love it for sure. Josh Brolin is spectacular in Thanos role, he completely nailed it. Thanos' adoptive children Cull Obsidian, Ebony Maw, Proxima Midnight and Corvus Glaive helps him to fill the infinity gauntlet with six infinity stones. They also had few outstanding moments in this movie. There will be a heartbreak in the first 5 minutes of the movie, so, one should not miss the beginning. Heimdall's uses bifrost one last time to save Hulk and succeeds by the way. The scene in which Bruce Banner warns Dr. Strange by saying ""Thanos is coming"" is striking. Dr. Strange seeking help of Tony Stark is an another moment to cherish by Marvel fans. Scenes involving Peter Parker, Tony Stark and Stephen Strange were remarkable. The entrance scene of Steve Rogers is breathtaking, Captain, Widow and Falcon rescues Vision and Wanda Maximoff from Midnight and Glaive. And also the scenes involving Thor, Rocket, Groot, Mantis, Gamora, Drax, Star Lord were picturesque. The king, Black Panther opens the door for the trouble and evil, he never hesitates to help ""all of them"", even if Wakanda destroys, he wouldn't care because he is the king. The entire action sequences pictured in Wakanda and Titan are jaw-dropping. Climax of the movie will leave you baffled and so was the post credits scene involving Maria Hill and Nick Fury. That was the best time to call ""Captain Marvel"" to the scenario. Be prepared for the heartbreaks in the climax, they were too emotional. On the whole, Avengers: Infinity war is a movie which will be cherished and remembered for a long time, like even for few decades or so. Infinity war is nothing short of an epic. A masterpiece. MARVEL-ous one from the Marvel Studios. I'm not going to disclose spoilers in my review, just go and experience the epic. We have to wait until May 3rd, 2019 to see how the mystery unfolds. Just 1 more year, we can wait as we have more Marvel movies coming this year and the next.

There are few exceptional scenes like, 1) THANOS' character development and his emotional side. 2) Soul stone sequence. 3) Reality stone sequence. 4) Entire action episode in Wakanda. 5) Action sequence on TITAN. 6) Dr. Strange's magic and all of his scenes are extraordinary. 7) Iron Man's battle with THANOS. 8) Thor's scenes with THANOS, all his scenes were executed very well. He is god of thunder man. 9) Captain and Groot introducing each other. 10) Guardians with Tony, Peter and Strange( So much fun). 11) Dr. Strange's sacrifice for the life of Tony Stark. 12) Rocket's funny conversation with Bucky. 13) Hulk in the Hulkbuster. 14) Loki says ""We have a hulk"" to THANOS And there are many more to experience. What you saw in trailers and TV spots are just 5% of the movie and rest will be on screen. Go for it. Do not miss it.

MCU LEGACY AND A MASTERPIECE !!!!,30 April 2018,Its everything you want but its more than you thinks meets the eye,10
An impossible task that manages to work wonderfully,10 July 2023,"I don't think many people realize just how genius of a movie this is. And a lot of people already know how genius of a movie it is. This movie and Endgame are going to be remembered for a very long time. I will be telling this story to my children. It is very unlikely that we will have such a grandiose movie after so great of a run in the MCU that works this well. The amount of preparation and work required for this is work is tremendous. On top of the 15 or so MCU movies before this dropped, it may just be the best MCU film so far at that point in time. (2018) You have 20 or so superheroes to give characterization towards while wrapping them into this giant blockbuster. And they couldn't have done it any better. The villain Thanos is one of the best MCU characters I've seen put on screen, not quite Tony Stark level but still amazing. The end of this movie is the perfect cliffhanger, and I remember just wondering where the story could possibly go from here. To do this much work and make it the best MCU property at the time is really a feat that I can't imagine being replicated, at least for a good while. Perhaps it's not everyone's cup of tea because there is so much action involved but it sure is mine. Bravo, guys!",10
What a triumph for Marvel! It just keeps getting better :D,1 May 2018,"I never give 10 stars but I can't stop thinking about this movie days after seeing it. All the story lines are brilliantly intertwined for all the varied superheroes and past movies. We were left devastated, but hopeful at the end of this one. I had to run out and rent Thor: Ragnorok the next day to help make sense of a few things. Glad I saw most of the others because it makes this film all the richer. I just need to see the Dr. Strange movie to get a totally complete picture, then you can be sure I will be watching Infinity War again! This movie pulls on just about every emotion and leaves us craving more story, more answers. Who will return and who will not. This is what it's all about. We are getting attached to every character, love them teaming together in fun, battle and in tragic times. They are each fantastic in their own way. I can't wait until May to see Part 2, and all the Marvel movies that are to come. Final note: Iron Spider MUST LIVE!",10

Great Great,23 September 2019,"The scale of this movie is astonishing. I felt like I was watching 4 different movies and they are connected to each other. Lots of laughs, emotions, excitement, and stories. Have to watch previous 20 Marvel films to fully connected to this movie. Great movie. At last end game.",10
Good for Wasting Time!,5 August 2018,"How can you think this film ""touches the heart"" while the plots offered at all have no elements that can be said to be ""human""?

This is just a film of a group of super-heroes that are very confusing, too many plot changes and stacking of hero characters, the storyline is mediocre and imposing to dramatic? The end of the film is forced enough to hang very strange and unclear? How can you be forced to ""wait"" for the continuation of an unclear story? One thing is certain, Avenger's will take revenge and win right in the next film? Think of it that way. But this Infinity Wars movie is really boring.

If I can compare it, then the LOGAN movie (another superhero movie) is more emotionally touching, human sentimental. But it not ever happen with this film. Only entertainment films, which are made with the aim of making a profit, with a messy plot.

Not recommended for connoisseurs of good movies, but please for super hero worshipers.

I hate my 2 hour and half gone to watching movie like this.",3
The Russo Bros are the kings of comic book movie genre! A hat trick!,27 April 2018,"Alright so I'm going to try my best to keep this as a NON-SPOILER REVIEW, as there are many shocking plot twists and surprises and I wouldn't want to ruin that experience for you. Wow! What a ride! This film was everything I wanted it to be! Exciting, thrilling, and beautifully crafted over the course of 10 years and 19 films. Yes, I have waited for this ever since the inception of the MCU back in 2008, but more importantly as someone who read Jim Starlin's Infinity Gauntlet series 17 years ago. It was breathtaking and jaw dropping to see something of this scope come to life on the big screen from the very same comics I read as a child. @therussobrothers did an amazing job balancing the tone of all the characters (comedic and serious tones) and giving every character their spotlight without making it feel too overcrowded or bloated. The action itself in some of the scenes were taken directly from the pages of Hickman's 'Infinity' run couple of years ago which made me really happy to see. Although there were a lot of surprises in the film, the one element that surprised me the most was the amount of emotional weight that the film carried, it really helped develop certain character arcs especially Thanos, and man oh man when Thanos comes on screen, he really steals it! Not only is he frightening and intimidating, but he has a very grounded and philosophical twist to his character that makes you sympathize for him and his surprisingly emotional motivations. Action was great and easy to follow with no shaky cams this time (yaaaaay!), but the overall story and execution was better than Civil War and Winter Soldier (which everyone knows I love to death). In the end this was everything I hoped and wanted to see in an Infinity War film and I really can't wait for Avengers 4 next year! Whatever you do, see this film before someone spoils it for you as there are many idiots going and spoiling it for others who haven't had the time to see it on opening day! Make sure you experience it in IMAX if you have one next to you, the screen is much bigger and visuals look more vibrant and sharp! Oh and there is one post credit scene so stick around after the credits for a treat!",10

High 9/10,9 June 2022,"Marvel's magnum opus, where 18 movies were leading up to this. Infinity War was able to do justice to every hero in the film. It manages to tell a compelling story, and you can feel what is at stake. With a movie as big as this, there would be a lot of plot holes. And a few problems with some character choices. But this movie screams grand premiere, like a season finale. This movie isn't also afraid to get serious. Although some fun moments are here, they never overshadow the film's high stakes and dire situation. Overall this movie is the best MCU movie of all time. The idea of a group of people fighting for the exact cause is fantastic. I completely love the teamwork of the movie shows, the characters of the film, the chemistry of the cast, and all who worked in Infinity War. And especially this movie is perfect for those who grew up watching the MCU. And watching it is a real roller coaster ride of total awesomeness.",9
"Not Just a Popcorn Movie ,As a DC fan I would Say Infinity war will Easily Rival Nolan's The Dark Knight",30 April 2018,"I like Marvel Movie as popcorn film .Never was that much invested in the characters as they felt empty but after watching Infinity war i will say that it has changed my mind .I can feel these character's pain ,struggle & their hopelessness .Its a Dark Movie with perfect mix of light comedy .Have to give credit to Russo brothers that they brought real serious stuff inside Marvel ,First Winter Soldier & Now Infinity War .I m Sad seeing the Demise of my favorite characters .I wasn't ready for that

Black Panther showed the WAY & Infinity war took it to Next Level with Really Good villain who isn't evil just for the Sake of Evil .As they say Comic story is as good as their Villain .Nolan showed that with Joker & Now Russo brothers showing that with Thanos .I can't hope anything better .Suddenly i feel i m Completely satisfied with a MCU film & I don't want anything more .

i would call Infinity war as the Second Titanic of the Movies,You can't do anything better than that ,its one of a Kind .It has created its own Legend .I have now new respect for MCU that it really deserve the Fame ,Money that its earning .It care for its audience ,comic lovers ,movie lovers .Its an art which will live far beyond its time",9
HOLY CRAP!!,27 April 2018,"A movie hasn't made me feel this way in a very long time. I read up on Thanos' storyline after getting home. A sliver of hope? Maybe, but I know how movies can divert from comic origins.

Jesus, stunned. What an epic movie. I know people have different opinions and all that, but truly, if someone doesn't like this movie then there's something wrong with them. Good gawd, I still ... we're floored. Rocked. Stunned. Stoked and did I say stunned? Theater watch FOR SURE! And... don't let anyone spoil it for you, holy crap.....",10
Great movie,6 May 2018,Just great enjoyed it. Do definitely recommend watching it once at least,8
"Better than expected, but still a narrative and thematic mess",12 December 2018,"Everything about this movie was portrayed as bigger and more. Bigger Action! More heroes! The problem with that eventually more becomes less and the story collapses under its own weight. That happens here but not as much as I expected. The final film is coherent so there's that. It is also largely fun. There's that too. However, there is still too many sequence of the same stuff (get the stone!) and a lot of the film is very unwilling to play with the world it has set-up. Of note Dr. Strange and Thanos (post reality stone especially) are far too punchy. You can change the fabric of reality. Why do you insist on just punching people?

A film like this lives, or this case disappoints on its villain. Thanos is OK as a villain. He is played well by Brolin. How he is written leaves much to be desired. His radical environmentalism simply doesn't connect with anything that is actually happening in the world today. It makes the film feel insular and escapist in the wrong way. Moreover, the logic of the character requires him to be either a eugenicist or a ""eat the rich"" radical; the screenplay does neither. The writers try to split the different by applying the big moment randomly. (but somehow random means 1/2 of each significant couple among the heroes). It simply doesn't work. It is not chilling. It is not human. It is silly.

The deaths (""deaths"") are overdone. I simply do not believe Disney is going kill off a bunch of Golden Geese. It simply doesn't have any emotional weight because too many characters that have sequels in the works ""die."" The ending only gets a hearty chuckle from me.

This film is fun. It moves and most of the action is good. But it is shallow, hollow and expects us to forget how capitalism works.",5

Marvel at its finest,29 April 2018,"The most hyped movie, and simultaneously the most justifyingly hyped movie of the year, it has the power to bring emotions out of nothing.

Thor's character from his earlier movies of being a hot headed barbarian to the rise of godliness is well put in this movie. Gaurdian of Galaxy guys...the all had improtant roles to play..especially Groot and Gamora. I would recommend this movies to other but after watching a Marathon of all the movies earlier. Only that can bring out complete enjoyment of this movie.",8
Amazing from Start to Finish.,27 April 2018,"Just see it, go now! One star reviews for this Film are completely ridiculous! This is the culmination of 10 years of Marvel films, everything's gradually been building towards the Infinity stones story line. Don't watch only this film and then complain there is no plot! The best parts of the film are the character interactions, it's genuinely hilarious, although overall the film is pretty dark in tone. It's no real spoiler to say that major characters do die. The standouts for me were Thor and the Guardians, so much great banter. The same can be said for Stark, Strange and Spider-Man. Most characters get enough screen time and the action is relentless, jumping from one action set piece (or World) to another without feeling too much. You will experience just about every emotion watching this film. The scenes in Wakanda was also a stand out, especially the battle! Make no mistake though, this is definitely part one of a two part film. It's going to be a very long year to find out how this story ends in Avengers 4.",10

Best Marvel Movie To Date....But It's Too crowded.,28 April 2018,"I enjoyed every bit of this film. The directors and producers did the best they could with this massive cast load and it was really fun to watch. But that being said, there are a lot of characters in this movie. With many characters that demand much screen time it was definitely a challenge to make sure that happens. I'm guessing that's why the movie was so long. I have nothing but good things to say about this movie. GO WATCH IT. The only negative is that I left the theater feeling that the movie was very crowded...because it was. The movie went all over the place and at some points you could really feel how crowded it was and it distracted you from the film. Other than that it was really well done. Thanos is definitely the best Marvel villain we've seen and it'll take a lot to top him.",8
The bar has been raised,28 April 2018,"Like most people I went in expecting it to be good, and serviceably handle the number of characters that had to be balanced. I didn't expect it to do I in such a consummate, thrilling, emotional, funny and powerful way. There have been high water marks in different ways before in the MCU - Thor Ragnarok (comedy), Civil War (ensemble), Guardians 1 (left field-ness), but this raises the bar in every way.",10
Good action and visuals,19 May 2018,"This is a well made Marvel superhero comic book movie.

You may stumble upon many reviews saying that this movie is Marvel's magnum opus, a comic book movie masterpiece that asks questions, brings up new and interesting ideas and stuff, but it's not.

It is written much better than most of Marvel's stuff, yet this type of movie has its limits, mostly because it is made to appeal to the widest possible audience. This means that some of the core elements have to be dumbed-down to be more understandable and simple. Thus all the drama parts are very simplistic in order to be easier to process by younger audiences. I hoped that this movie would have been a little heavier but it's not.

This fact also affects the dialogue, most of which is either a failed attempt at humor (yet the ""target"" audience, younger kids, seemed to be enjoying every joke in the theater), or an attempt to overexplain the simplistic plot, or some really weird pop culture reference younger audiences won't be able to understand anyway. Thus, most of the talking parts were a pain to sit through with rare exceptions. There was one good joke set up by War Machine in Wakanda though.

The action was great, even though at times it was hard to understand what was going on. From time to time the superheroes even use their abilities in a clever way. CGI was mostly good too and some of the environments they created were pleasing to the eye, especially the Vormir part, neat art direction. Kudos to all 3000 of CGI artists and studios that made this movie. One of the weakest technical parts was the soundtrack, the tracks were forgettable and not fitting at times.

Plotwise the movie was extremely predictable, furthermore, the events of the second part are also easy to predict. I don't want to spoil anything, but a change of heart is what we are going to see.

A well made movie that, while being probably the most emotion-packed of Marvel movies, is still unable to provide you with that feel or emotion when you leave the theater changed at heart.",8
I'm not a comic person and I loved it,30 April 2018,I've seen a handful of any of the marvel movies at most and can I just say wow!!! The banter between characters was humorous and it was TOTALLY worth the extra money to see in 3D. I'm sure die hard fans/ purists of the marvel world will find fault in it somehow but I truly enjoyed myself.,9
What a movie !,7 May 2018,This movie was Amazing ! i actual think this is the best movie i have ever seen.,10
Like watching video game with a dumb ending,29 October 2018,How is this movie rated #51 of imdb all time? It's a terrible movie with the premises of obtaining stones to put on a glove to end the world. And the ending is silly as all other Marvel movies have been announced so it doesn't matter who survives and who doesn't. I didn't enjoy this movie. It's almost as if you're playing a video game or watching your friend play a game while you watch.,5
"GREAT BLOCKBUSTER, BUT",31 May 2018,"The movie was good. The hopes and expectations might be fullfilled. But feel like the movie could've been bit longer, so it could not fall into the messy montage alignment. That was the bit of bitter tinge for me. Although the minus, the movie is a grand adventure. That's all from me.",9
Absolute godlike of a movie,31 May 2019,"This movie is perfect, any scene you can see in the theatre you cannot change to be better. Acting could be done way better for an absolute 10/10. I dont think there is much to say, but the storyline is the best from all of the films (Excellent Music, Great Acting, Godlike Story my final score is 9.8)",9
Best movie ever I watched..But I am Confused after Watching it,28 April 2018,"War, Surprises, Death, Sad Moments, Funny Moments, Some Wanted and unwanted Deaths, Returns That's all this movie is about...

I can say that after watching this has created intense hunger to watch the upcoming movie",10

Wow,21 May 2018,"Doesn't get better than this!!! Unbelievable movie, the last years of Marvel movies had a goal... this movie.",10
Its no Super Hero Squad Infinity Gauntlet,28 February 2019,"I'm probably the only fan of Super Hero Squad: Infinity Gauntlet but if you found this Avengers: Infinity War too heavy you should give it a try. Infinity War is filled with more super whiners than super heroes; unless you like your superheroes to whimper, demand to be sacrificed, argue, and to die. Not my idea of good times. Not lining up to see the sequel/conclusion. I'd rather read the comics, or watch it on cartoons. Also, it's stupid that the Fantastic Four and Silver Surfer aren't in this universe.

Try to say something positive: ok, the villains were different and refreshing. And it was cool to see so many Avengers represented. Had some cool scenes. Gave it a generous 6/10 but will never watch again.

Hero up! and watch Super Hero Squad or for something less childish, Avengers Assemble Season 2, which also tells the story of Thanos.",5
Hold on for A Thrilling and Heartbreaking Experience!,28 April 2018,"What an excellent movie! The first ten minutes will blow you away and possibly make you shed a tear or two especially if you're a true Thor, Loki and Hulk fan. I was angry and thought WTF just happened during the first ten minutes of the movie. I literally held my heart as I continued to watch the movie. The movie was so intense. Other movie participants were gasping,laughing, and rooting for their favorite super heroes. We all wanted the Avengers to kill Thanos. I am a true fan of Marvel comics/super heroes and I was devastated that my heroes failed to eliminate the villain. Iron Man and Spider-Man were simply great together. Also, Dr. Stranger and Iron Man were a hoot!

Anyway I will stop here because I don't want to spoil the movie experience for others. Please note that all movie goers were clapping and cheering when the various heroes made their appearance. I thought I was going to collapse when my favorite super hero was stab! Marvel should give us fans a caution warning ""Emotional Trauma Alert."" Go see this well executed movie. The ending will leave you angry because there is no closure. But I have to admit, I will see this a second time and I can't wait until 2019 to see the ending. Thanos will return in 2019!",10
Movie ending that was unexpected from the franchise? ... only if it is end. ;),19 May 2018,"This big movie franchise has captivated the attention of audiences world over. Been a fan of the series since the 1st Avengers movie. But was not fan of the 2015 movie Avengers: Age of Ultron as it was a regular charade of fighting of big bad villains.

This movie was quite different experience then its prequel. The big cast line up is amazing. Story was bit stretched in certain parts but at normal space mostly. Non-stop back to back plots keeps the interest in the movie.

Fate of most characters don't look good but the sequel will reveal the what really happened to them. :P Overall a good action movie for this summer.",8
WORTH THE 10 YEAR WAIT!,31 July 2018,,10
Kickass Super Movie,29 April 2018,"Avengers - Infinity War-Marvel(lous) Movie - My review Firstly for Superheroes movies - there are minimum 2 kinds of audience 1. One who have read those comics and have high anticipation of the characters 2. One who have watched the movies but not the comics, yet have high expectation of the movie And maybe a bit of both... Regardless this movie was a Highly anticipated, Awaited, High expectation movie for the Super hero genre. So how does it stand? Do read on... For the record I belong to the 1 type audience, I grew up reading the super hero comics- both of Marvel and Dc so I am aware of the power and the character of the heroes. The review is strictly of Marvel - characters of this movie. To begin== A kickass- Blockbuster movie Like I always mention a Super hero is made a hero based on the villain and the tasks that they undertake and accomplish. The villain has to be good and strong. Does the Villain - have that impact- a strong YES, an exceeding expectation characterization of 'Thanos' as the villain. All the trailers have not let down the character of Thanos in the movie. He is a Granddaddy of all super villains- thus far. Exceeding expectation of the villain role. He is impeccable and portrayed as a super villain to perfection. No flaw in his characterization. Perfect fit a Super villain? >> Does the movie have flaw/cons - Yes, but do they impact the outcome of the movie - No Sir, The flaws are at minimum to negligible - only if you strictly try to find them, will they feel so.

To the story. Before that I, marvel the manner in which Marvel studios have linked up all their superhero movies and those who have watched the earlier movies can co relate to that I am talking about. The story- it begins from where it was left (Thor -Ragnarok) . No spoilers here of the story as the trailers are clear of what Thanos is all about and the rest of the story is how the heroes fight/defend..There is no point talking of the story as that is the least of the concern. What is most important is the number of heroes and their characterization, The movie requires 20 + heroes( got this from some updates on net... I was to engrossed to count) to fight him. That says a lot of the power of the Villian. Does this lessen the role of heroes? No- Each character was given sufficient role and every character played their part to perfection. The Visualization are visual treat. The video format was in Imax and it was amazing. What was surprising was the audience reaction in the theatres. The audience was vocal, emotional, reactive to the scenes on the screen, I saw them gawking, cheering, whistling , cussing at villains, and literally jumping off the seats at an exciting hero event. And this reaction is not of kids, but Adults. This shows how much the characters have an impact on the audience and how much they are involved. There are some jaw-opening, mind blowing situations that HAS to viewed and experienced in the cinema.

Reading comics and watching the characters come alive on screen is a huge thing. In comics it is not that hard as it is all drawing and it is upto the reader who understand and get involved. But on screen you are stuck with the characters and their interaction and their reaction that is what is the essence that makes you glued to your seats and Marvel has done it to perfection. You can feel and anticipate the chemistry/the intensity when the characters face each other and feel as if they are the real characters. Any cons of the heroes - minor - find that toward the end.

Pros - everything about the movie, the anticipation, the excitement, the breath taking visualizations, the characters, the actions, the sound, the imax affect . The movie leaves you with a Deja vu effect that would last even after you come out of the movie. I hated the movie to end. It is amazing that inspite of this movie being a super serious movie, Marvel directors were able to include pinch of humor in between. Thor was Cons= The movie should have been longer and that would add more action (wink, wink) Like I mentioned there are few flaws/cons. That I should also mention. Thanos seems to have got more time on the movie, I personally would have preferred if that time was spared for a hero. But I guess that was needed to portray the 'Thanos' character. The characters of Vision and Hulk were not fully utilized to the potential that they could. But then that does not have huge impact as the story keeps moving up. The part of restoring a weapon to Thor and the part of restoring the eye was bit overdone maybe something could have been done better - but trust me even if you watch it after reading this review it would not affect the outcome. Tony Stark(Robert Downey jr) maybe getting a bit old as the age shows up.. but no impact as I don't think anyone would want that character to be replaced. To summarize What do you want to watch a movie for? To get the bang of it, the money worth. And becoming a fan of the characters. I am positive you would love one or the other characters of the movie. All this and more is what Avengers is all About What are you waiting for- Go watch it Imax. I will watch it again. So what is the final take-- This is a Daddy of all Super hero movies. A kick ass movie- Worth watching in Imax.",8

Avengers Infinity war,31 August 2018,One time watch movie.Hype is very bt very disgusting movie,3
"The decade of a bar set high, if not higher. Had different expectations, just like others with theirs.",27 April 2018,"Avengers: Infinity war is a solid base foundation that wastes not an ounce of time in setup territory. Instead, the more relevant plan is just to do the things that the first eighteen MCU movies have long been leading up to, being a decade for that matter.

First up, the action is an absolute win factor that frequently elevates the movie in the direction it should be going right where it initiates. The script-writing with essential MCU humor remains intact as to be usually expected. Both the heroes and villains have their equal bargain of screentime. And to put the lackluster theory to rest, Thanos alongside the rest of his forces attributes to one of the more significant beings of villainy thus far. The cameos and particularly some eye-popping returns are perhaps the ultimate power up mid way through. It really does however feel as though the element that gets this ambitious threequel stirring along is the dynamics between characters typically as they encounter one another for the first ever time. Just when it seemed like the pace might be draggy and formulaic, it really wasn't. Only the shuffle might not necessarily have been executed at peak level.

Now just to make things fairly simple, the teamwork in every action scene is enough to keep you intrigued. The duration per action scene isn't quite as long enough, thereby making it seem that Civil War's airport battle remains the top tier contender for a well earned time being.

Spider-Man is great but it feels like his whole depiction works in the MCU more by weakness than strength. Comically, it works. But maybe his stakes could broaden up in the future. I get that there were plenty of others too.

The X-Men/ FF deal isn't here too soon for a live action crossover. Maybe now we'll relish the blast of the Avengers and Guardians together. Fair enough, I'd reckon.

The visuals felt breathtaking and genuinely on point.

What's with these trailer shots that don't make the cut anyway?

The adventure this movie sets foot upon doesn't weigh down the plotlines. Yet it would seem that characters exist, do their stuff. Maybe not as hugely as a collection as any wild expectation ought to get. Maybe Civil War was where the Russos timed the juggle right, and this time the priorities seemed like a shift from previous executions. It's thankful enough to say this movie didn't have any setback that made it suck. The sound editing is suitably good. The final act felt reasonable and delivered a fistful of Thanos mayhem. But I'd rather refer to this movie as a combination of heroes than a culmination of efforts. I'm already betting on the next Avengers movie to embark the grander way to prominence.

Oh yes, got to love the post credit scene.

In the end, Infinity War works as much as a teamwork crossover event as it does as a villain biopic depiction. It has enough contention of its own to rank its way to the top MCU movie depending on how you look at it. I haven't listed any spoilers, even though I pretty much read all I could before even watching it. Well, it's my thing as my criteria goes about knowing stuff beforehand and seeing how it plays out in the result. But others probably do not feel the same way so this is entirely spoiler free.

I'd hoped for a complete 10 star rating. I really did. The stakes couldn't be better. But I'm starting to think I miss Whedon's work.",9

Triumph of scope,4 May 2022,"Avengers: Infinity War is impressive, delivering everything that could be reasonably desired from a Marvel movie. It showcases thirty superheroes, provides a purposeful villain, and has genuine surprises. Infinity War could've easily been a mess, but it's held together by the significance of Thanos. Plus, protagonists are cleverly separated into digestible groups, giving everyone space to synergize and contribute. MacGuffins are central, consequences are temporary, and logic is inconsistent, but the film is so grand and character-driven that these shortcomings are forgivable. Ultimately, Infinity War connects because it puts character motivations first.

Technically, Infinity War serves its drama. The filmmaking is safe, but subtle touches are optimally placed. Specifically, the acting shows real pain, the music is silent during low points, the sound gets symbolically muted, and the production design has undeniable magnitude. The effects are CGI heavy, but their range and detail are weighty. Plus, the editing balances all the moving parts, skillfully timing subplots and pacing the extensive runtime. The cinematography remains fairly straightforward (and occasionally unsightly), but some techniques are exhibited. Overall, because it unifies immense vastness through emotional focus, Infinity War is a triumph of scope.

Hero movie amazing,28 April 2018,"The best hero movie ever, i never expect the movie be like that exceptional movie ,amazing story,",10
Just a short way off of being epic or a masterpiece but lives up to all expectations,30 April 2018,"First of all before my review of the film, I think we all need to say a huge thanks to Marvel Studios/Kevin Feige for the last 10 years of hugely entertaining films that they have gave to the whole world, if your a fan or not, what Marvel Studios has achieved will likely never be replicated or done again by any other film studio and you have to congratulate them on their huge success, so thank you Marvel Studios and Kevin Feige for releasing in my view, the most fun, most entertaining movies anyone will ever watch in their entire lives. I personally think Marvel Studios could bring out a movie about a garden fence or a broom and it would still be a box office hit and be the most entertaining thing you'll ever watch. Marvel Studios and Kevin Feige simply have a Midas touch, everything they do literally does turn to gold, albeit box-office gold, long may they dominate and be as successful as possible.

This was always going to be a hugely ambitious project, squeezing every major character into this movie from the first 10 years of films was always going to be a difficult thing to do, but I believe they did fantastic in giving each character screen time, others have more screen time such as Thor, Iron Man, Doctor Strange and Thanos, I would have liked to have seen more of Captain America, Black Panther and Scarlet Witch but I realise not every character could have as equal screen time as other characters simply because characters like Doctor Strange etc are more key to the films plot/story. You do have to wonder if maybe some minor characters were needed or not, as there are a few who really have no lines such as Black Widow, Bucky, Falcon and some others, it did feel as though these characters are there just for the sake of it of it although in theory they didn't need to be. But kudos to the Russo Brothers for managing to give each character their own part to play. I think the run time was just about right clocking in at 2 hours and 40 minutes, this never dragged as there was so much going on and it really does keep you glued to your seat not knowing what is coming next.

Thanos, I do confess I had a feeling that Thanos wasn't going to be portrayed the right way, I actually thought that he would be just a similar villain just like Loki and other weaker villains in the MCU. But this is the Russo Brothers we are talking about, no way were they going to get Thanos wrong. In the first opening scene you will fear him in an instant as he takes out The Hulk, literally decimates him, from this moment the audience know that Thanos isn't one you wan't to mess with and you will know that the Avengers etc are going to have to do something remarkable to defeat him. This is a villain who wants to wipe out half of humanity and you will clearly understand his motivations for doing so, maybe the world needs a Thanos as currently with the world population in real life getting bigger and bigger each year, there might be a time when we all can't live on this earth, back to my review and not politics/climate change lol. Anyway, Thanos is done close to perfection, the CGI does not look out of place once and you would think it is Josh Brolin in a suit or costume, he looks that real, speaking of which, Josh Brolin absolutely nails the part, the voice, emotion and for looking menacing, perfectly cast again from Marvel Studios, you will simply wan't to see much more of Thanos, unfortunately in next years Part 2/Avengers 4 he will obviously be defeated which is a shame. Even Thanos collecting all Infinity Stones is done perfectly, I won't spoil for anyone who is yet to watch the film but what he does with some of the Infinity Stones is great to see.

There is so much action in this film, one of the best battles is when Iron Man, Star Lord, Drax, Mantis, Spiderman and Doctor Strange are battling Thanos and the Avengers actually look as though they have defeated him by removing the Infinity Gauntlet which has all the Infinity Stones on, this is a stand out scene as you have a team up seen for the first time, it is great seeing the Guardians interact with Stark, Doctor Strange interacting with Spiderman, for me the best one had to be Thor meeting the Guardians on their ship, Star Lord getting a bit jealous of Thor's muscles. Another highlight is the clash of egos between Strange and Stark, all new team ups are done perfectly also and fingers crossed in next part we will see more. Action scenes are thrilling, especially when battling Thanos.

The end was a bit of a strange one for me, and for many others and it won't be to everyone's liking, again I don't spoil for anyone yet to see this, but it is probably not the best ending as everyone knows it will be reversed in the next part. I guess it is a slight criticism of Marvel Studios in that they announce their schedule for the next five years or so, so you know who will survive and who will be brought back via the Time Stone. Other than the ending and not much screen time for fan favourites such as Cap, Black Widow, Hulk and others, there isn't much more to fault about the film, I did leave the cinema thinking where was that epic battle scene? whereas they are more in small doses rather than on a large Lord of the Rings scale, there is a battle in Wakanda but the action cuts away from there some times to another battle, it was best to cut to different battles as all groups are in different places during the movie, it would have been hard to have all the Avengers, Guardians etc in the same place and have that epic Avengers moment with all the characters standing side by side.

I think every actor is great in this, Chris Hemsworth literally can do anything, laugh out loud one minute then crying the next due to losing pretty much everyone, Downey Jr is great again and delves into sadness and in fear of what potentially bad things are going to happen, Chris Pratt is just as funny as Hemsworth and you see the chemistry between the two actors, Benedict Cumberbatch gives a fine performance as always as Strange, everything from his accent to the look of that character is done to a tea and with ease, Josh Brolin is perfect, hard to imagine that is Brand from The Goonies, Brolin has created a villain you can sympathise with, feel for and someone you fear, the voice he gave him is done to perfection, all the cast are great, and I really do believe that no other actors can play these roles. I really do hope that Evans, Hemsworth, Downey Jr, Ruffalo etc continue to play these roles, perfectly cast and I can't imagine the Avengers being played by anyone else.

If you are thinking of giving this one a miss DON'T, because of the characters, action galore, team ups, the villain, the infinity stones, characters get killed off, the comedy and lastly for the stakes which are big, Infinity war has it all and then some. I will go and watch it for a 2nd time and maybe a 3rd because it is a cinematic event ten years in the making, and lives up to the hype.

Here's to next April when we get the real end with Part 2. Congratulations to the Russo Brothers for making another phenomenal film, congratulations to the cast also for playing their roles perfectly. and lastly congratulations to Marvel Studios for 10 years of truly great great films, here's to another 10, hopefully the Marvel Cinematic Universe don't change too much after next April, with a plethora of characters they can introduce and what with the characters they already have, hopefully Marvel Studios can continue to be even more successful.

Forget there being any kind of Superhero fatigue, Infinity War is currently breaking every record imaginable and looks set to be the highest grossing movie of all time, and that's only in it's opening weekend, simply phenomenal. To all the superhero haters, these amazing/great/immensely entertaining films are here to stay. Takes these Marvel Studios and DC/Warner Bros movies away and the Hollywood box office would suffer in a big way.",9

"The Culmination of Everything Results in an Amazing and Thrilling, Emotional Blockbuster of Epic Proportion!",7 March 2019,"I have followed the MCU and its characters all the way through ten years, and was never so pumped when I sat down in my red pluche chair in front of an IMAX screen. My expectations were met, and sometimes even blown apart; this is one of the most emotional and thrilling movies I have ever seen, and one of Marvel's best works.

Acting:

The core players in the form of Robert Downey Jr. , Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth and Scarlett Johansson are all in excellent shape, each providing a strong performance with the traces of ten years of film on all of them. Not every one of them has a compelling arc (it is hard to say if you can even call arcs in this, since it is essentially part one) but they all have their own glorious moments.

The newer players like Benedict Cumberbatch, Tom Holland, Paul Bettany, Elizabeth Olsen, Chadwick Boseman and Anthony Mackie are just as good, and just like the core Avengers, some are more compelling than others, each one having their bright moments.

The Guardians are an interesting bunch; because the teams are so vastly different in style and personality, it is fun to watch these weird guys play off against ""normal people"" from earth. They all do a great job, particulary Zoe Saldana in one of her best performances yet.

The one who truly stands out above everyone else however, is Josh Brolin himself as Thanos: the motion capture, while not flawless, is ridiculously impressive and brings an essential humanity and vulnerability to what is essentially a genocidal maniac. He is aside from Killmonger perhaps the best villain yet to come out of the MCU.

Direction: The Russo Brothers once again deliver a visceral and tense experience that carried over from Winter Soldier and Civil War, while equally providing intimate and soft emotional moments, balanced out by hilarious quips. Where they fail however, is handling the Guardians just as good as James Gunn. Their scenes often feel vastly different from the rest of the movie, and sometimes like a sore thumb, not nearly as funny as under the original director.

Cinematography: Trent Opaloch, who worked with the Russo's on Civil War and Winter Soldier, has brought his A-game to this movie, not just filming action in a visceral and intense way, but also composing beautiful(digital) imagery filled with characters in their most challenging moments.

Plot: While this movie is essentially a giant third act, it delivers greatly on entertainment and thrills, with each group of characters having an interesting plotline, culminating in fantastic battle scenes and an ending that will leave you in shock for hours to come. The pacing is quite breakneck, but never bothering.

Music: Alan Silvestri returns as the composer from the first Avenger movie, and while the score is not quite as rousing and fantastic as in 2012, there are great themes present, with the emotional scenes drawing nearly all their strength from these beautifully composed pieces.

Editing: Considering that the construction of this movie took ten years, it is quite a miracle that it flows all so cohesively and smooth within two and a half hours. The ""big scene"" transitions are especially effective.

Sound: Not particulary noteworthy, but by no means bad. Many sounds don't stand out.

VFX: This movie has a LOT of CGI, some executed brilliantly, some looking quite unfinished. The CGI for Thanos embodies this duality to the fullest. In the end, the nomination for an Academy Award is understandable, but not deserved.

Production Design: While a lot of it is blue screen, the atmosphere and scale of every location is carried over well, and you can't help but be impressed with every setpiece.

Costume/Make-up All the heroes come together in their signature outfits, with some nice new additions like the Iron Spider and the Wakandan tribes. Not much different from what we've already seen though.

Action: The action in this movie, while mostly digital, is spectacular in pretty much every sequence, and there are a lot of moments were your jaw will just drop in awe because of the massive scale and sheer awesomeness.

Tone: From the first five minutes, it becomes clear that this is the darkest and most serious MCU movie yet, and that the stakes have never been higher. The feeling of dread and danger never leaves, and when the blood starts flowing, you feel every death carving a mark on your soul. The humor, while genuinely funny, feels half the time out of place, and particulary the scenes with the guardians feel like they belong in a different movie.

General Concensus: A massive blockbuster that Marvel can be most proud of, and while it can't represent each character in the smoothest way, it's scale and gargantuan action completely blows that flaw away, aided by great chemistry from the cast, a compelling villain and an absolutely shocking ending. 8.6/10",9

Infinity War Lives Up To The Hype,7 May 2018,"For 10 years, Marvel has consistently pumped out masterful works of superheroes bringing the genre in the spotlight of modern cinema. Now the culmination of all their works has finally been released. This movie provides intense, edge of your seat action scenes; but also surprises with its emotional arcs. Every character you have grown to love has a moment to shine in this film. Bu the real spotlight is on the villainous Thanos, who plans to become the most powerful being in the universe. While a large majority of the villains within the MCU have been forgettable with no proper character development, Thanos changes the game. Within the first few moments of the film, you witness the strong presence of Thanos. But no good villain is without proper character development. Throughout the film, we are shown Thanos' motives and are given an emotional dilemma for Thanos, which, despite being a Mad Titan, actually humanizes him in an unexpected way. Overall, this film is filled with star performances, fantastic action set pieces, and a menacing yet emotion view on a villain.The Russo brothers have given us another summer blockbuster that will please the fans of the Marvel Cinematic Universe with this intense and heart-breaking film.",9

A new level for an MCU,26 April 2018,"""Avengers Infinity War"" arrives, after 10 years. Everything the fans wanted to see is here, from grand battles to exciting moments. Finally seeing all the characters built over so long is rewarding. Thanos is scared and powerful, becoming Marvel's best villain. Stop what you're doing and go see ""Infinity War"" is a very fun and epic experience, and the end will leave everyone waiting for Avengers 4!",10

Popcorn movie,2 May 2018,"Good movie but at the end it's a popcorn movie I can't imagine it's among the top 10 movie of all time ... It's pure CGI and Visual effects how this can be with Godfather, Goodfellas, Fight Club ...etc.",5
Think of it like a season finale,27 April 2018,"For the last 10 years Marvel has led up to this. All your favorite characters in one movie for an ultimate showdown. But if you aren't familiar with any MCU film before, you'll be completely lost. This is the cliffhanger-season finale of your favorite show. So brush up on your Marvel knowledge if it's been a while and sit back because this may be the best MCU flick to date.",9
"An entire universe, once and for all...",27 April 2018,"Avengers: Infinity War, the breathtaking action packed world phenomenon. Avengers: Infinity War follows the Avengers after the accords as they face a new threat: Thanos, the space invader who is on a quest to collect all the infinity stones so he may rule all with unlimited power. The movie literally will have you on the edge of your seat. The director(s) did a great job of juggling all the characters and creating great collaborations between the beloved heroes. This film is one great team up that will have you in awe and in tears. If there's one thing I advise for viewers who plan on watching the film is: be prepared for one BIG cliffhanger. When I went to watch the film the audience was struck with a hint of anger and a touch of excitement in the end. The film does have twists, suspense, awesome fighting scenes, and great laughs that will have you begging for more and wishing the second part to the film would come sooner than next year. The time is coming for the avengers to end and almost time for an emotional goodbye. I highly recommend the film even if you haven't gotten around to the previous films in the series. Watch it and love it!

Awesome movie,28 April 2018,It is just amazing great story line straight in to the action. All the marvel movies lead to one big one. Just can not wait for part 2,10
Everything Fans Could Have Hoped For.,15 March 2019,"It's all been building to this. Every movie, every new hero, every cosmic artifact and alien civilization. It's all been leading to the big showdown. And it is magnificent. The battles, the team-ups, the twists and turns, every moment of it is spectacular. This is what we've been waiting for.

Infinity War wastes no time getting started. Beginning right where Ragnarok ended, it hits the ground running and never stops. The fights and the deaths start in the first scene, and momentum builds and builds from there as Thanos's plans are set into motion and the heroes rally to stop them. From New York to Wakanda to the edges of the universe the action is almost nonstop, pausing just long enough to let us catch our breath. The numerous brawls and battles are fast paced, beautifully staged and photographed, and varied enough to never get tiresome. Black Panther's climactic battle in Wakanda was awesome. Infinity War's is at least ten times better.

This is also a movie brimming with character. And characters. Virtually every hero and anti-hero Marvel has introduced up to this point. No time is spent on introductions because know them already. If you don't then you have some serious catching up to do before you watch this. Chris Pratt is still as shameless, vain, and hilarious as ever as Star Lord. Tom Holland is still spouting movie references and trying to impress everyone as Spider-Man. And teen Groot is your average moody teenager, only with superpowers and a three-word vocabulary.

And with all of them thrown together there are some awesome team ups. Iron Man and Doctor Strange. Spider-Man and Star Lord. Thor and Rocket Racoon! Even with so many characters in play every one of them gets their chance to shine, both in battle and with the lines they deliver. The chemistry between them all is remarkable considering that many of them have never appeared on screen together before.

Of course great heroes need great villains to fight, and Infinity War delivers. Though most viewers have never heard of them, Corvus Glaive, Proxima Midnight, Black Dwarf and especially the Ebony Maw make an immediate impression with their sense of menace and deadly skills. But nothing compares to Thanos himself. He's not just Marvel's most dangerous villain, he's their best. He is incredibly powerful, undeniably brilliant, and absolutely mad. Not raving lunatic or spontaneously violent mad. His madness is cold, calculating, and filled with certainty that every ounce of death and suffering he inflicts serves a higher purpose. With his power and single-minded determination, he is an absolute force of nature and watching him in battle in simply incredible.

For those who worried that Marvel was getting too goofy, fear not. The tone here is as far as you can get from Ragnarok and still be in the Marvel universe. The humor is still here, and it still works. There are lines that will have you laughing out loud. And thank goodness, because otherwise all the death and destruction would get DC level brooding. Infinity War is a movie that knows the value of a little comic relief, but it really knows how to be serious- even somber- when it needs to be. It can be a real emotional roller coaster, so buckle up and don't get too attached to anyone.

Now I'll admit that the story is mainly there to string together the big superhero fights. That said it's pretty good, with multiple converging plot threads and a fair number of twists and turns, some of which are downright jaw dropping. Peter Dinklage's mystery appearance is better than anything we could have hoped for, but there are much more shocking reveals as characters and plot threads that were seemingly forgotten years ago reemerge.

And the ending... well not everyone will be pleased, but it took guts, and it's one hell of a cliffhanger. Part two may only be a year off, but the wait is going to feel infinite.",10

Fantastic,26 December 2018,"The latest addition to Marvel's onslaught of cinematic masterpieces really does its job of icing the Marvel cake. The acting and dialogue was superb, the special affects (as always) were amazing, and perhaps the best thing about this movie was its ability to NOT BE predictable. Josh Brolin's performance as the main antagonist Thanos was excellently executed and managed to get me to see things from the villain's point of view (I never do that). The other performances were as well fantastic. There is little to say in the realm of so-so for this movie, other than the fact that Endgame can't come more quickly.",8

"Hypnotic, very good...",17 June 2023,"Iron Man, Thor, the Hulk and the rest of the Avengers unite to battle their most powerful enemy yet -- the evil Thanos. On a mission to collect all six Infinity Stones, Thanos plans to use the artifacts to inflict his twisted will on reality. The fate of the planet and existence itself has never been more uncertain as everything the Avengers have fought for has led up to this moment. Thanos (Josh Brolin) finally arrives on Earth, willing to gather the Infinity Stones. To face it, the Avengers need to join forces with the Guardians of the Galaxy, while dealing with disagreements between some of its members.

Very good, despite not liking excessively action movies, and the film is necessarily based on action scenes, all very well done and almost hypnotic, very good...

8.8? No way. 4 for the CGI team The rest.. phooey. It's a turkey. Compare Infinity war to Ready Player One - No contest. RP1 Wins hands down.,14 May 2018,"I've enjoyed some of the Marvel oeuvre.. but honestly.. this is not up to the mark, nowhere bloody near, not at all. Let's be honest; It's a turkey.

Very poor directing, Russo bros.. whoever they are.. it's like.. are they in the right job or did someone mistake the set janitors and kept them on to lower costs? Shoddy in fact; - they'd have been far better off using whoever directed Thor 3, Dark World or Avengers Age of Ultron, or Ironman III, Or even Thor Ragnarok, - all better directed and more watchable movies.

The cinematography of the 'live' footage was generally awful. I mean, shocking. Amateur. It made me wonder if they'd used the wrong lenses or cameras or something.

As for performances.. 'Acting', as it used to be called.. where to start.. I'll keep it simple: Most of the 'stars' including RDJ are taking the piss.. it's not as if they had a great deal to do anyway, but.. they must be laughing all the way to the bank.. call this a day job? They're getting money for old rope.

The screenplay, the plot - is practically non-existent, and what there is is balderdash, tripe, codswallop and piffle. Half a crap story painfully overstretched into well over two hours.. the ending is a complete cop-out / a cobbled together mess.. they must've been stoned and thought it was clever.. it wasn't, it isn't.

I was actually looking forward to seeing this.. but having already seen Ready Player One a few weeks back - absolutely no contest - Ready Player one is a truly great movie, by a great director, great cinematography, screenplay, story, plot, music, soundtrack, FX, ideas, the whole kaboodle.

Comparing Avengers Infinity war to ready Player One is like putting a used Edsel next to a brand new Aston Martin.

This is a big big budget movie that (apart from some quality CGI) looks like it was made on a shoestring in a back-alley. Shame on the Russos.. and whoever else was responsible for this forgettable pile of doo-doo.

Oh, the (almost entirely scored) soundtrack wasn't bad.. but way too glorious for the poor character playing, performances, script and screenplay.

Watch it when your friends buy the dvd or something.. save your money for DeadPool II or buy the DVD of Ready Player One!",4
Worth the wait,27 April 2018,"This was an amazing film. So many awesome moments, so many dark moments, and it all tied into a perfect blend.

A Culmination of Ten Years Work Results in a Masterpiece,27 April 2018,"It's not often that movie franchise with 18 movies already creates something fresh. Avengers: Infinity War is exactlty that. A fresh creation from the Russo brothers who excellenty craft a film of immense build up and hype around it. They effortlessly get the best from their cast, many of whom who have not had on screen interactions together. The result is a massively enjoyable journey in which you're given moments of hunour, joy and the inevitable sadness. The on screen cast of what may be the best ensemble cast of our time, works incredibly well with chemistry which for some takes two or three films to develop. Infinity war delivers, whether your a lifelong fan of marvel stemming from the comics, the MCU or quite simply a one off movie goer this film is a delight. Marvel have created something fresh and just as exciting, if not more so than the first Iron Man movie ten years ago. Thanos is without a doubt the best MCU villain, making all who come before him look like a weak pretender and he the true big bad. The Russo Brother's portrayal of him is perfect, instead of him being 'Mad' the way he is in the comics. They attempt to humanise the mad titan, almost making you undertand his goals, almost. Josh Brolin's performance is brilliant, his delivery of the lines makes Thanos a modern day Darth Vader. A being torn by his beliefs into something so twisted that nothing will get in his way. The tone of the film was perfect, hopelesness was looming over all but despite this our Avengers never give up. For the pressue from inside and outside for this film to succeed, the Russo brothers deliver an effortlessly crafted masterpiece. That has rasied the bar for all over superhero films that will follow it. Bravo to all involved. As this behemoth culmination of work, leads to the best superhero film of our time. Well, until Avengers 4 perhaps. Go and see this film, you will not be dissatisfied.",10
If you don't understand Marvel your not a fan!,17 May 2018,"I was greatly anticipating this film and it did not disappoint. Of course we all see the MCU big and grand which it is and then some. You literally have to be a Marvel fan to understand the story line and had to have watched all the movies to get to this point. As a movie goer you have to invest the time to fully critique it. The characters I have come to enjoy and I feel the majority of all top billed actors embody the superhero or villain persona and play it well. You can also read the comics to get an idea of where the director will possibly go next in part 2. From comic book to the big screen Disney has achieved what most studios wish they can do in the super hero arena and be extremely successful at it. Kuddos to them and I'm delighted Marvel is in such good hands. Lastly, I read some reviews on here which I carefully dissected and I've come to the conclusion they did not read comics or just not Marvel fans. I recommend reading before critiquing. Just admit it was a great film and if you were asked to take part in the next film as an extra or actor you'd raise your hand immediately. That's all!",10
Best Superhero Movie ever,7 May 2018,"The most intense, complex, and stirring Marvel Cinematic Universe film yet. Its kind of amazing is how seamlessly the various pieces of the Marvel fit together.

And oh the big bad Titan Thanos, Lord know I wouldn't wanna mess with him Jeez. It was awesome seeing him and his goons in action on the big screen.

"""Avengers: Infinity War"" sucks...",5 May 2018,"...so good!

WoW! This movie was good! Very good, to say the least. I sat there in the theatre, chained tro mey seat because it was so very entertaining and exciting. I can safly say that this is the best marvel movie to date! I'm even inclined to say that its better than ""The Guardians"" movies which where my favourites till today. 10/10!

Go watch it, but make sure you watch the other marvel movies from disney before you seee this one, because you might not get what is going on all the time. I recently rewatched all the MCU movies and I must say It helped greatly. There were a lot of people in the theatre who said things like: ""Who was this guy again"" ""Why was he there"" This is the only negative thing I have to say about Infinity war. It might get confusing if you have not senn the other movies. But other than that! Awesome!",10
You've done well marvel,30 May 2018,I went into the cinema expecting a move that i would talk about for weeks... it turns out that it's a movie that i will be talking about for months!! A great film and would recommend to anyone Marvel fan or not!,10
Incredible - no spoilers,28 April 2018,"I did not grow up reading comics but I have certainly enjoyed a lot of what Marvel has developed over the past 10 years. Some misses, in my opinion, but no one does superhero movies/television better than Marvel.

All of that to say, Infinity War is near perfect and is the best Marvel Studios production, thus far. It is incredible and should be a contender for Best Picture and Best Director(s) the next awards ceremony cycle.

I cannot wait to see this again!",9

Do not miss this gem of a movie. People rating this movie 1/10 are complete jerks.,1 October 2018,"First of all, those having difficulty in understanding the movie have not watched all the 18 movies prior to IW. Everything in this movie is outstanding, and what most people ignore while rating is the fact that the story is yet to be completed. The movie, as a whole, is written very nicely. Some details have been purposely kept out as they will be highlighted in the next Avengers movie, due to arrive on 2019. The character development is fine, as the makers have not shied about revealing the humane side of the superheroes. Thanos is the big baddy, and he dhows the megalomania we all love in a classic villain. Once again, watch the movie and judge yourself regarding the hard work of the whole cast and crew.",10
Wow,14 May 2018,Amazing throughout.. ! Thanos is probably the best villain to hit screen on par with Heath ledgers joker.,10
Boy do I wish you could rate it higher,28 April 2018,This movie deserves all the positive reviews that it's getting. It stays true to what Marvel is and it only makes me more excited for Avengers 4. Nothing wil be the same. So worth the time. Will absolutely have to see it again. 10/10.,10
Fun is the balance of the universe!,20 October 2018,"Marvel has started its universe in the uttermost incredible fashion with the start of Iron Man back in 2008 and continued to implement its origin stories and sequels for the next 10 years setting up an iconic film, Avengers Infinity War. This movie turned the tide of what's considered a marvel Villian and produced some staggering scenes that took courage and consistency by Joe and Anthony Russo. This was indeed a Thanos film focused more on his quest for dominance and the infinity stones. It literally felt like 3 films in one bringing over 50 characters together and actually making this work well. I have never seen a director bring so many actors together and create such a memorable masterpiece!",9
Worst MCU movie to date!!,11 October 2018,,1
Amazing,28 April 2018,I really enjoyed watching it. The movies is really recommended for everyone!,10
Easily has one of the most fleshed out villains in superhero movie history that is aided by convincing CGI and a great performance by Josh Brolin,29 April 2018,"Thanos as a character was the showstopper for me throughout the entire movie. I have never had any interest in such supervillains featured before in movies and cartoons because they seemed to be too powerful and without any flaws. Also, on the represention side, they looked too CGI-ey to the point that they were merely characters from an overly done cutscene in a generic video game. However, Thanos became very appealing to me throughout the progression of the story in Avengers 3 and I became heavily invested in his character arc. He is definitely among the most fleshed out in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, almost to the point where I was rooting for his cause, having a strong emotional connect with him, rather than siding with the good guys. This was a very non classical comic book villain with a lot of moral relativism .

The CGI was very good in depicting Thanos' grandeur. It actually felt like a 10 ft tall guy, who was very imposing and charming, having his way onscreen. Not any of the uncanny valley silliness going on. The motion capture of the actor Josh Brolin's facial expressions blended seamlessly with the digital build of Thanos. Also, Josh Brolin did a fantastic job on his own bringing this titan to life. There were some plot points where the character of Thanos did in retrospect sort of act like a fool but Josh's acting easily helped evade that observation while watching the movie.

My only big gripe with the movie was when it kept going back to the plight of Scarlet Witch and Vision as a couple. Their chemistry was very bland , boring and cliched and the scenes that featured them were the only instances the film moved very slowly to me. Almost to the point I kept looking at the time on my phone waiting for it to pass.I was least interested in those characters.I just wish they were written such that they both took a cyanide pill and saved the audience the trouble of keeping up with their Twilight romance nonsense.

Also, there is a certain cameo in this film by a certain someone and I like how the physical build of the character that the person portrayed was a direct subversion of the actor's actual physical stats.

Overall, a damn good enjoyable popcorn movie having a solid A+ villain.",8

Great movie,28 April 2018,Finally a marvel superhero movie you cant fully foresee whats gonna happen. Perfectly combined major characters.

What An Ending!,27 April 2018,,10
EPIC,1 July 2018,"I must admit, when I first heard the majority of Marvel characters were going to be in this movie, I was unsure, not knowing if it was going to be too much or not. And since seeing this movie, I found I was terribly mistaken. Probably the best marvel movie yet, apart from Spider-Man Homecoming which I cant choose between but I think infinity way is slightly better.

And no, it was not too much. Just remember, this isn't DC (who are literally a sinking ship) and marvel haven't made a bad movie since Fantastic 4. It actually worked with a large amount of heros in one place. It was funny, sad, full of action and the story line was spot on. It is such an epic film and when it comes out on blu-ray, I'll watch it that day!

The casting is absolutely brilliant and couldn't have been better. It was so unexpected and the fact that it's taken 19 movies to build up to this one is incredible. It really keeps you on the edge of your seat. If you are a fan of marvel or even if your not, you need to see it.

I really shouldn't have doubted it in the slightest because every time I do, I just remember that Fantastic 4 was made years ago now.

Never. Underestimate. Marvel.

SPIDER-MAN WAS AMAZING THO!!!

Tom Holland, Robert Downey jr, Chris Hemsworth, Chris Evans and Chris Pratt especially. Tom Holland and Robert Downey jr in my mind, were just amazing together. I thought they were really good!",10

I feel like there might be a lot of hate coming from fans of other movies, but everyone needs to see this movie somehow someway. It is incredible. I don't want to ruin anything, but many people are saying there is no plot. These people obviously don't know what a plot is, bc the plot is clear as day, and it is to prevent thanos from getting the infinity stones and ultimately defeating him.",10

Avengers Infinity War my favorite best Marvel movie of the year,23 December 2018,"Avengers Infinity War is my number one favorite Marvel comic book movie of the year with loads of fantastic CGI and many superheroes banded together the stuff the maniacal monster Thanos the Mad Titan and his black order. I loved how Infinity War takes place right after Thor Ragnarok as a crossover story in which today's movie Industries crossovers are the new thing and sequels are very obsolete. My only complaint with this movie since I read the original Infinity Gauntlet from 1991 they did not follow the 616 universe because there's no Adam Warlock or magus and especially mistress death in this movie. Also I guess this is more than one complaint Doctor Strange was killed off, Iron Man was Left Alive in the movie while in the original Infinity Gauntlet Tony Stark was killed and Doctor Strange remained alive throughout the six issue Limited series. They were not completely that inaccurate the writers and producers and directors of the movie because Spider-Man did actually died and The Infinity Gauntlet along with black panther, and half of the Guardians of the Galaxy except Drax the Destroyer. Drax the Destroyer has remained alive throughout all the infinity Story lines in the Marvel comic books I have no idea why he was killed off also why was Black Widow kept Alive when she actually died in the Infinity Gauntlet 616 universe.

An Emotional Rollercoaster Ride for MCU Fans,27 April 2018,"This is what the Marvel Cinematic Universe to date was working towards. It's the culmination of 10 years of interwoven plots and character arcs. And boy, does Avengers: Infinity War deliver.

The movie manages to find an almost perfect balance of action, drama, and humour (there a couple of truly hilarious scenes). While the movie is long with 2 hours, 40 minutes of running time, it never feels so. If you are a fan of the past MCU installments, you will find this to be one of the best movies of the series, that will shake to you to the core.

But this leads me to essentially the biggest problem of the movie: it's pretty much exclusively targeted at hardcore fans of the MCU. While you (most likely) will be able to follow the plot, you will have a hard time to untangle the web of relationships between the heroes, to unstand how they got in their current situation, and in some cases even to identify them: a couple of major characters never even gets addressed by name once in the whole movie.

In addition, it will be difficult to feel emotional attached to the heroes. While every of the protagonists gets their moment to shine, there's very little characterisation or even development. A small number of crucial characters get a single emotional scene, or maybe two, but this is barely enough to make you sympathetic to their plight. Pretty much all of your investment in the heroes will have to come from the previous movies of the MCU.

On the other hand, the movies antagonist Thanos gets thoroughly characterised and fleshed out. This is what makes Avengers: Infinity War really special and standing out in the mass of MCU movies. A villain with true depth. While his actions are cruel and atrocious, he doesn't act out of a wanton lust for destruction but rather out of a twisted sense of duty and even a perverse way of... kindness. Josh Brolin's subtle motion-captured performance further helps to make Thanos despite his bloodthirsty savagery appear human and almost relatable.",9
Cannot Be Topped,23 March 2019,"Avengers: Infinity War is unlike anything you have ever seen and possibly will ever see! It delivers on the action, the drama, the suspense and the humour. The Russo Brothers have yet again delivered. Anyone who thinks this is not an amazing movie is talking complete nonsense. Thanos is the best villain in the history of villains. He has emotions like a normal person, yet acts like a madman. But what he's doing, he thinks it's the only way to protect the universe, that's waht makes him a great villain. Overall, I would give this an eleven out of ten if I could.",10

The special effects were perfect. The comedy was actually really good. I loved that we got to see more of Peter Parker. Everything really fit like a puzzle.",10
Watch it before some spoil the climax of this epic superhero saga,1 May 2018,"Direction:

Director Duo Anthony and Joe Russo got fame when they had directed Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014) and Captain America: Civil War (2016). They have done exceptionally brilliant job for Avengers because they have used strength of each and every superhero in right proportion. Audience hail the direction when they feel connected with the script and characters through out the movie. Entry of each superhero create some noise, claps and whisttles in the cinema halls especially Captains's entry.

Performance:

As multi-starer movie is always a challenge for director to maximum utilization of each resource. I can say that each charter has given his 100% in this epic war saga. Robert Downey Jr., Chris Hemsworth, Benedict Cumberbatch, Chris Evans and Tom Holland have leaded from the front. Mark Ruffalo, Scarlett Johansson,Don Cheadle,Chadwick Boseman,Paul Bettany,Elizabeth Olsen and Anthony Mackie also did justice with their role and power. Josh Brolin has played unforgettable role of super villain.

Script:

Hats off to script writer Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely for brilliant writing as inclusion of emotions in the Action based Super heroes flick. There are some light moments also delighted the story-line.

Dialogues:

Dialogues were witty and full of punches. When Iron man include Spider man into Avengers , he did something like priest did in the church after throwing Holy water. That scene was quite funny. Conversation between Thanos and Iron man was also epic and some clue lie in that conversation as well.

Box-Office:

On opening day, it has collected 31 crores so 100 crores will be target for Weekend. As partial holiday on Monday and Tuesday so momentum will be continue in first week. Second week will be decide whether it will earn 200 crores only in Indian domestic market or not.

Last Words:

Don't afraid about many spoilers posted on social media because no one able to comprehend the climax of this movie. Everyone waiting for sequel of this movie so that there will be end of their curiosity. So wait for 3rd may 2019.",9
One of the best movies i've ever seen so far.,27 April 2018,"A remarkable movie for ending first 10 years of MCU. Things i love the most about this movie are the villain and the ending. Thanos is truly the best villain in MCU. His emotions, his ideal, everything about him had shown in this movie made me and so many fans love him, even thought he was right. And the ending, it make me speechless for 2 days to think about it. It actually is the ending that most of the fans has wished for. The ending makes me on the emotionals roller coaster. Infinity war is absolutely awsome. Note: To enjoy this movie, you should watch some MCU's movies first to know some characters and to understand them",10

I'll be honest and note that as far as I'm concerned comic books are among the lowest forms of media, and the movies all feel more or less the same. I've always been a fan of second chances so I watched it with a friend and by the end it felt like we had seen two different movies. It was just another generic superhero ensemble movie with extra pretentiousness and angst, thanos was just a madman who convinced himself he was rational. It just further shows that being a nerd doesn't automatically mean you're smart, I can't wait until Hollywood gets past it's nerd phase...",1

Welcome to 2018's Greatest movie 10/10,31 July 2019,,10
A cinematic history.,27 April 2018,"This might be ONE of the biggest movies of all time, aside from the superhero genre. This is part one of the final journey of our favorite heroes as they battle against the powerful titan. The movie started quite a bit off - fast paced and rushed introduction of some of the characters, which I think we all could go along with since we've already met them.

I saw the movie on 3D and the fight sequences made me dizzy but I shook it off because of the story and I want to keep an eye on every scene because THERE AREN'T DULL SCENES in this movie. Yes, you might say that some scenes with chit-chat could be dull but, every scene is important and plays a role for this movie. My friend saw the movie at 2D and told me that it was great. Maybe, I'll watch it again. This time on 2D to focus more.

With some of the small flaws I've said, the movie was still good. With these too many characters, we should give the Russo brothers an applause for still pulling it off and made a HISTORICAL film. This is the very first time that I've seen audiences shocked, speechless and drained after the movie ends. I've also heard that one person fainted after Infinity War because of the ending. And this shows that people are so attached with the characters and that we all love them that the ending had the effect on us. Yes, we all might be speechless, shocked and ""WTF?"" and it was because, again, the movie did it right. Some of the scenes were like pulled off from the comics. Thanos might be the best villain in the MCU with his motivation and the depth of his backstory.

With that said, here's my final tip and quote from Doctor Strange movie: Forget everything you think you know. Forget everything about your theories because this movie will blow your mind.",10

The wait is over,6 May 2018,"Whether you are a fan of marvel films or not, Infinity War is a tremendous masterpiece that conveys the struggles of the Avengers in a way that we as an audience can actually feel their pain and anxiety oozing off the screen.

Perfectly balanced, as all things should be.",10
OUT OF THIS WORLD,30 April 2018,"I'm very pleased by the way MARVEL does their movies. They flow well, I feel like there isn't a huge gap in the story and everything makes sense. I absolutely loved this movie and can say that I didn't expect some stuff to happen, but it definitely did a great job.",10
The Averagers...Get 'Em All In The Movie War,30 December 2018,"The movie had its moments but overall was a let down. The plot at its basic level is a good story line but the surrounding elements are bad. The humor which is usually stellar in the Avengers movies is poorly timed and poorly delivered. The story is disjointed and feels like they wanted to cram as many superheroes into the film as they could regardless if it made sense. ""Two minutes for you and six minutes for you and three minutes for you."" Hopefully the second movie will be the saving grace.",5
An Unexpectedly Exciting and Unconventional Superhero Film,6 July 2018,"""Avengers: Infinity War"" comes at a time when I'm personally at superhero movie fatigue. With each addition to the MCU being the same fast food cinema of mediocre and enjoyable film consumption, I enjoyed ""Avengers: Infinity War"" and was pleasantly surprised at how much care and difference the film was given compared to the other members of its family.

The film is a culmination of an empire of superhero storytelling which gets seriously bogged down by its overcrowded palette of characters. The film essentially follows none of these heros but rather, to my pleasant surprise, mainly follow the antagonist and villain, Thanos, played by Josh Brolin. In many ways, he feels like the hero of the story due to how much attention the story gives him to convince the audience that this could be one of the best written villains in a superhero film every written. We understand this character to a depth that was honestly alarming and fascinating. Each scene builds on the next to carefully create a character we go from hating, to want to see him succeed.

Thanos is definitely the best aspect of this film and him itself gives the film a massive advantage over its many flaws and criticisms. In keeping in line with the film's writing, since much attention is given to Thanos, we are given a disappointing inbalance in hero characters that share the screen. None of which really developed arcs or changes we see in the film. Despite the overall disappointing characterization, stakes are higher than they ever have been. This again goes back to the phenomenal protagonistic villain and well orchestrated action sequences.

Additional complaints about the script include truly head-scratching plot holes and questions like, ""How did he get there?' 'Why didn't she just do that?"" Many of these questions, that appear throughout the film genuinely matter since they took me out of the film and made me question things I should not have been worrying about. Better care definitely could've been taken into creating a more cohesive and consistent plot that makes more logical sense that it deserves.

Visual effects on this film is fantastic and nothing else really needs to be said on this front. CGI's detail and scope is something to be studied by aspiring visual effects artists. General look definitely reflects the talented directors, the Russo Brothers. They prove once again that they understand what makes a film exciting and enjoyable to watch.

Despite my issues with ""Avengers: Infinity War"" it honestly was such a surprise and enjoyable film to watch. It felt refreshing despite its darker and heavier tone and will be much more remembered than the past 10 additions to the MCU. This finally felt like an epic story rather than an inconsequential episode to the fast food cinematic machine that the MCU has become. This one is definitely worthy of the praise and massive revenue its received.",8

Great stuff. Bring on Avengers 4!,28 April 2018,"The end of this movie gives new meaning to the phrase ""done and dusted"", though I can't explain that without a spoiler! No doubt at all, you get your money's worth. Infinity War pulls you right in, there's never a dull moment, and it's every fan's dream to see this many heroes all at once. I'd say the strongest part of this one is just how well all of them are managed. Still -- I'm going to hold back giving this a numerical rating for IMdB till I see Avengers 4 next year. (Note added a year later: I've seen Avengers Endgame now, and I rate them both 8/10. Endgame is splashier, but Infinity War has a more tightly constructed storyline that is handled masterfully.) It's not giving anything away to say that these two movies are a duology (or actually a duology with a prelude, which is Thor Ragnarok: the action bridges seamlessly from that one to AIW.) Some things happened in TR that I wasn't fond of, but they turn out to be resolved anew in AIW. It sets up some big new problems though, so how effective AIW turns out to be will depend on how well they bring it home in A4. People who want to judge this one harshly -- just wait. This is only the first half of a bigger story. I've got my own ideas about how it's going to shake down but there are already a bunch of ""theories"" being floated out there on the Web.

OK: in short, this one raises the bar yet again for the genre. Marvel has a smoothly running machine that knows how to turn out a well crafted product; and I have to give their writers and planners credit for thinking way ahead -- concocting plot arcs that unfold over several films. Full credit as well for giving us a fantasy world so absorbing that you kind of have to shake yourself back to reality when the credits finally roll. I felt the same sort of way with the Lord of the Rings trilogy (the original three, not the Hobbit trilogy). Each of those three films was about 3 hours long, complex, layered, and interlocked. Is AIW at the LOTR level? No. The LOTR films were a bloody miracle. But the new Avengers is darn good.

After the terrific success of Thor Ragnarok and Black Panther in just the past few months -- along with CA Civil War (2016), which was functionally Avengers 2.5 -- it wasn't clear what they could do to top all of that. And maybe if AIW turned out to be ""just as good"", it could still be counted as a win. But it's better. The CGI is state of the art, the jumps between the multiple plot lines are expertly timed, and since almost all the characters are already familiar they don't need backstory time. After the first 20 minutes of so of dramatic entrances, you can just settle in and watch them go. The characters that do need introducing are the villains -- Thanos himself, who isn't actually in every scene but somehow feels like he is, and his powerful Black Order minions. Thanos has plenty of time onscreen to develop his backstory and goals, but the four Black Order chiefs are given zero backstory, essentially there to give several of our heroes something to fight.

And about the heroes -- it was great to see Dr. Strange, Scarlet Witch, and Gamora being given the screen time and status they deserve. Some others may have been shortchanged, though that might mean they'll have bigger roles in A4. Benedict Cumberbatch, Elizabeth Olson, Josh Brolin are superb actors, Tom Holland is good and getting better, and all the rest of the cast are more than competent. And for me the surprise of the whole film was Peter Dinklage's role, which takes the way he's shown in his other movies and delightfully stands it on its head. However, in this kind of movie the best actors won't be used to their full potential anyway, because the story itself is the main thing and they are all there primarily to keep it moving. Brolin does nicely at raising Thanos from a one-dimensional character to 2-dimensional (can't really expect anything more in superhero movies) as someone with a past and with strong reasons for his actions. He's an evil man doing the good that good cannot do (If I recall right that quote is from a Mickey Spillane novel); it's just that his idea of ""good"" involves erasing half the living beings in the universe.

Two other little complaints: the words 'galaxy' and 'universe' are used interchangeably (which is like comparing a grain of sand to the whole Earth). And there's a certain CGI effect repeatedly used toward the end that is directly borrowed from X-Men The Last Stand.

All in all, it's great stuff. I'd go and see Avengers 4 right now if it was available.",8

It's the best it could possible be,29 April 2018,"I really have to commend the Russo Brothers and Marvel Studios for this film. I can't imagine what a task it must have been to balance all these many characters and still make a good and entertaining film. That said, it's not perfect. It's a bit too long, and a a little bloated. It particularly gets a little dull in the middle. However these flaws were always going to be unavoidable for a film like this, with so many characters and tones having to mesh. That's why I say that, while the film's not perfect, it's the best it could have been. The film is quite funny, and all the jokes land. The action is great. Seeing the characters meet and interact is very fun. The highlight of the film, for sure, is the villain. Thanos is fantastic. He has a clear motivation, and real menace. Very fun film for everyone. It is definitely a part 1 though, so keep that in mind.

The Empire Strikes Back II,3 May 2018,"There are a great many reviews out there for this film, so I thought it would be relevant to say this for those who are fans of the Marvel Universe series who are planning to see this movie: I am guessing you will probably not like, maybe not get and probably ruin your enjoyment of this franchise if you have gaps in your Marvel movie watching. If you have seen most of them but have missed the last four movies before this, for instance - it won't be the same at all.

Do yourself a favour if you are invested in this franchise. I know that sounds dubious as if I were a paid shill, but be real: Marvel do not need anyone's advertisement at this point.

I say this mainly because, seeing as friends and family are going out to see this in groups and have missed recent movies, they will not get the most from Infinity War. I have seen the film twice already, and the more people I know who are going out to see it with films missing, the more I feel bad that they will not get the best experience. If you have never seen a Marvel movie, I would not bother.

In essence it would be like watching The Empire Strikes Back without first having seen Star Wars: A New Hope, or watching the last season of Game of Thrones without having seen the previous seasons. It would just make no sense and ruin all that could be. If you haven't seen some of the recent movies like Guardians of The Galaxy vol2, Dr. Strange, Spider-Man:Homecoming, Thor Ragnarok and Black Panther, do yourself a favour and borrow them from a friend, take the time to enjoy them; then watch this. I think it would be pointless otherwise. The movie is going to be out for a while so I feel there is plenty of time to catch up.

I saw it in IMAX 3D, which was amazing, and then again in Real3D, which was also unexpectedly amazing. The IMAX showing gave this big film the big experience the film deserved though.

Just thought I had to put this message out there. No point having a ten year story arc ruined for no good reason at all.

Also, there are some pretty heavy scenes which I don't think would be good for very young kids who won't understand what is going on. I think my Nephew would probably be traumatised, he is only 6. Plus the film is very long, 2 hours and 30 minutes. He would not hold out that long without needing to go for a break, so if he does end up coming with us to see it we will need seats near the exit for breaks. Perhaps being a bit shocked might be good for kids nowadays. Star Wars certainly was shocking for me when I was little, and that only made the experience better.

I really enjoyed this movie thinking I would be possibly disappointed, having bought and read the original comics back in the early 90's

I will probably be seeing this more than 10 times!

Wishing all a great time at the movies this Summer

Avengers: Infinity War is Probably One of the Best Movies Marvel Will Ever Make!,19 May 2018,,10
Well done Marvel.,29 May 2018,"The best: Close virtually unbeatable for the ten years of the MCU, drink of the best of each Marvel saga. The way to bring all the protagonists together is sublime. The BSO and the CGI are the best that has been in the MCU to date. Unite with such elegance and naturalness the themes that are given in each of the films and none of them is out of place at any time. As for the CGI, what to say, one of Marvel's strengths since this universe began and once again does not disappoint. The brothers Russo direct and most importantly, they mount the film and that's where the difference between this film and a movie of the genre is noticed. The worst: The script has more holes than a ""Gruyere cheese"" they teach a lot and they count little, they leave all the answers for the announced Avengers 4. The times of the film are quite badly taken and the subplot of Thanos and Gamora are left over in the movie .",8

"Avengers: Infinity War (2018) - Quantity, Not Quality",13 October 2018,"Well, here it is, what the MCU has been building towards, a showdown of epic proportions and a gathering of (most) of the numerous superheroes we've been subjected to mercilessly over recent years. So the big question is, was it worth the wait? To put it bluntly, no, it wasn't.

No doubt Marvel fanboys (and girls) will go crazy for 'Infinity War' and regardless of the quality of the film itself, it is going to be loved and lauded by the franchise's enthusiasts simply for the privilege to see all of their beloved characters together in one place. Unfortunately the enthusiasm of the fans does not seem to have reached the actors themselves, who now appear to have reached the point where they've realised that the film is going to be a commercial, and to a degree, critical success, no matter how well (or poorly) they perform. So, consequently, they don't really bother to put in much effort. And why should they? Their sizeable paychecks are already guaranteed just by showing up. So, just showing up is what they choose to do. After all, let's face it, unlike the devoted audiences that continue to spend their hard-earned cash to go and see these films, they're in it for the money, not for their love of the source material.

The lead actors universally deliver not only the worst performances of their MCU careers, but in some cases (Mr. Downey Jr., I'm looking at you), arguably the worst performances of their entire cinematic careers. Content to just coast through proceedings without a shred of genuine emotion or charisma, they seem to be merely fulfilling the terms of their contracts, as opposed to what you'd call 'acting'. And these are not bad actors, by any stretch of the imagination, almost each and every member of the ensemble cast have proven they are capable of delivering outstanding performances (Chris Pratt and Tom Holland not included) in their other filmic endeavours. So it has to be said that their devoted followers deserve better. The one shining light in all of this is, ironically, the film's chief villain (or hero, depending on your viewpoint, but I'm not going to get into that now), 'Thanos', portrayed brilliantly by Josh Brolin, who seems to be the only actor that's aware he is in fact in a very, very big film and not some frivolous dress rehearsal. Maybe, as a newcomer to the franchise, in his excitement to be a part of the biggest cinematic universe of all time, he was determined to deliver an outstanding performance worthy of the Marvel name, or maybe he's simply the only one who cares enough to try. Either way, it's extremely hard to find anything to criticise him about personally. Well done, Mr. Brolin.

Now, the reason I've been so critical in my lambasting of the acting in this film, is because of how important is is to the outcome of the end product. This is supposed to be a genuinely emotional, moving cinematic experience, which if you can suspend disbelief enough, is not out of the realms of possibility. But when the characters appear to be completely indifferent to the events unfolding around them, it's very hard to empathise with them, much less care about what happens to them. Without giving to much away, as many of you will know, it's in this film that we have to say goodbye (at least temporarily) to some of the saga's most beloved characters, I won't spoil anything by stating who these may be, but I will say that it's very unlikely that you're going shed a tear over, or indeed, give a damn about any one of them.

As for the plot, well obviously it's no 'Citizen Kane', but it's far from boring either, however the generic action sequences, though typically spectacular in their visual effects, can begin to border on tedious at times.

I know i'm not alone when I saw enough is enough. This exercise in escapism has been enjoyable enough at times, but it has now run it's course. I'd love to believe that after the next instalment of the Avengers, this whole MCU fiasco can finally draw to a close, however, I've got a sneaky suspicion that the powers that be will still manage to drag this out for at least the next few years, if not the next decade. But, as a passionate film fan, i'm now going to try to avoid these movies as best as i can and stick to more intelligent, adult-orientated and, for lack of a better word: 'real' cinema. 4/10",4
"After seeing this movie the only word I can think of to describe it is ""wow.""",27 April 2018,"I was curious to see how they can bring so many leading characters to one movie and make it work and let me tell you they did it. Plot holes from previous films were filled in the process of this action packed movie not to mention it was funny with great one-liners mixed with tragedy. This movie left me speechless after viewing it and all I could think was ""wow."" This was an excellent movie that did the comic book some justice and was entertaining. This movie left me wanting more and I cannot wait to see what they will do next.

However, if this is your first Marvel movie (if you read the comics you would be fine) I think it might be hard to follow since there are so many characters and a lot of the development started from previous movies and there was a lot of information involved that may have made it difficult to understand the storyline. I only mention this because there were a few people in the theater that never saw any of the movies prior to this and were confused about the characters and about the details for the storyline.

GOOD POPCORN MOVIE. NOTHING MORE.,11 December 2019,"Marvel did it again. Oh, that's not exactly a compliment. It's a critic of the MCU films, if anything. Why did I wrote that? Here's my reasons:

Handle and manage to juggle many major characters
Interesting villain (only recent few films)
Typical move of dip-your-toe for a few minutes and then dips out again for the plot. It's really becoming MCU's staple of plot line development. What I meant here is just like Civil War and Black Panther, it tries to do the heavy stuff but then reverts to the same safe play move

One of the best marvel films to date,28 June 2018,I was really exited for this movie and after watch I am just amazed the charcters are amazing josh brolin as thanos is incredible and the action is so good a must watch film,9
As heroic as the superheroes themselves...,27 April 2018,"First thing first: Marvel has hit a bull eye with it's post ten year celebration with this movie. There is absolutely no dispute about the fact that Infinity War is the most anticipated movie ever in the comicbook history so far but it is compelling to know that it is completely worth the hype. The movie had everything which a CB fan is looking forward to. From perking actions to tear causing dramas this latest installment in the Marvel series is a treat to watch. The only irky part about the movie is that it rushes to end quickly after a steady start, but when you have to pickup 22 superheroes' storyline that is what you should expect first. Go to the theatre and have fun but take tissue along with you too.",9
Great Superhero Movie,30 April 2018,"Infinity War is a great superhero movie with a good mixture of action, drama, and comedy. Marvel has outdone themselves with an epic movie ten years in the making.",9

Wonderful,11 April 2022,,10
Epic,4 October 2018,Ten years of build up paid off. Besy villain in the MCU. Generally upsetting in places. Laugh out loud moments. Amazing effects.,10
Assembly-line work,21 November 2021,"Yeah, I get it: the bigger picture, the grand finale, and how it all wraps up the entire mcu saga that was build up for so long.

And I do agree on that one. What the MCU has established over many years is impressive. It really is. And there is nothing I can think of that comes close to this type of lifetime-achievement. Touché!

But let's be honest: that doesn't make the movie itself good or interesting. Since many years the primarily asked question for MCU movies and the most discussed topic is the ending credits scene. Imagine that! You've just watched a movie and the most important question doesn't seem to be the movie itself and how well you were entertained but what comes next to complete the bigger picture. That is the truth and nothing but the truth to the success of the MCU.

Infinit war is no exception to that. The movie as it is is boring, way too crowded, way too much CGI, the once so great heroes get degraded to cannon fodder but all the critics and many viewers praise it as one of the best movies ever. Simply because of the greater picture around it.

To me that is the real oath of manifestation. The early MCU movies we're great movies. The newer ones are just mediocre with a strong universe supporting them.",4
Amazing,9 January 2019,10 years later and it didn't disappoint one little bit!! Love it!!!,10

Best Avengers movie to date,13 May 2018,"Marvel and the directors have done a fantastic job at keeping the movie spoiler free, so I'm going to keep this review spoiler free too. :)

A few things you should know going into the movie, if you are deciding if you want to take your child or whatever, is that this movie is not another Thor Ragnarok. This movie is super dark to Ragnarok's light-hearted, fun. Not that it isn't good, its just different. The second thing you should know is the movie will not end resolved. This is more like a part 1. But a tastefully done and much needed movie split, not like Harry Potter or Twilight or The Hobbit, where it just seems like a money grab. And as always stay after the credits for the Marvel patented end credit scene.

Hands down the best thing about this movie is the villain Thanos and the amount of character development the put into the script. It's almost unprecedented the amount of screen time afforded to the antagonist. The second best thing is all the characters in this movie! The scale of the Marvel character integration is is just awesome. We see the Guardians of the Galaxy cast meet Thor, we have Spider-Man, the Black Panther, Dr. Strange, Loki, the Winter Soldier, and the core Avengers team: Iron Man, Captain America, the Hulk, the Black Widow, Vision, the Scarlet Witch, and more! We really only miss Ant-Man and Hawkeye. :(

This is a must see in theaters movie, before you accidentally read or overhear a spoiler. Best enjoyed with popcorn.",10

The humor was out of this world funny, the action scenes were next level awesomeness and the cliff hanger ending!

Worthy culmination,17 January 2019,"I watched Infinity War for the third time, and the first at home on my television. The impact was no less than in the theater. It is a sprawling epic, made contextually satisfying if you have seen the lead-up Marvel films going into it. The characters are familiar yet evolved. Tom Holland as the teenage Spider-Man is especially refreshing as both new hero and fanboy. But most attention goes to Josh Brolin's motion-captured Thanos, a villain who is formidable, but engaging; evil but charismatic. No punches are pulled in the finale of this installment, leaving most exhausted and introspective. It affects more than a comic book adaptation should. My personal wish is that this was the end - no more sequels - as what a story it would be.",8
Whether you like the mcu or not Thosbthe type of movie you'd wanna watch,27 April 2018,The movie is great l loved I was waiting for a long time ppl will prolly say the ending was bad it wasn't it was just a cliffhanger so that they can make the movie avengers 4 more interesting,10

Works only in the context of the Marvel Cinematic Universe,27 May 2018,"Taken in the context of a larger narrative within the Marvel cinematic universe, Avengers: Infinity War impressively brings together the many beloved characters together for an action-packed adventure. However, the movie does not work on its own as a narrative, and like most Marvel movies it has particular cinematic flaws. From the first scene, it is clear that Infinity War relies heavily on CGI for both its characters and action sequences, which should not come to a surprise for Marvel fans. In fact, it is plausible to say that more than half the movie is touched by CGI, from epic space sets to flashy bursts of light denoting magical power. The CGI isn't done badly, but for anyone who isn't on completely board with that style of animation, Infinity War would be unwatchable. At times, the amount of mystical sparks, auras, and beams becomes so saturated that it is difficult to take the movie seriously. Luckily, Infinity War has some of the world's most beloved actors and characters in its arsenal, which have proven to be Marvel's greatest strength as a franchise. Having Robert Downey Jr. as Ironman, Benedict Cumberbatch as Dr. Strange, Chadwick Boseman as Black Panther, and Chris Pratt as Starlord, just to name a few, give their characters credibility and charm. The writers do an excellent job balancing the many heroes, whose individual movies are often tonally different. Since the audience presumably has come to know and love each character from the standalone films and/or the Avengers, the actors are able to slip into their respective roles easily. This gives Infinity War a feeling of akin to huge family reunion, which definitely works in the movie's favor because the audience is emotionally invested. What makes the movie unique is that instead of following the traditional three act structure, the entire two hour and forty minute film acts as only as a chapter in a larger Avengers movie. Infinity War could be described as the latter half of a second act and the beginning of the third act. This means that the movie is almost entirely action with little exposition or character development. The lack of elaborate backstory or convoluted plot is refreshing in some ways, as some of the other Marvel movies suffer from over-complication. The action is well-choreographed and relatively creative, but because it fills the entire movie it can be mind-numbing. Anyone not familiar with Marvel or critical of the franchise will find nothing to connect to. Unfortunately, Infinity War lacks the political complexity and mysterious suspense presented in previous films. Shades of gray on moral dilemmas and conflicts between the heroes are downplayed or ignored in favor of a clear good vs. evil battle. Infinity War is a success within the world of Marvel, but not as a movie in its own right. Fortunately for Disney, Marvel is wildly popular among critics and fans alike, making it a financial and critical success. All of the advantages and disadvantages of a cinematic universe are shown in this movie, making it a unique cultural phenomenon.",5
It is unlike anything ever done in the history of cinema,28 November 2019,This one is masterfully woven from the culmination of Marvel movies throughout the years. Truly amazing!,9
Brave b***ards! Amazing,26 April 2018,"These directors managed to erase the lazy lack of build and character assassinations in Thor Ragnarok to deliver a spectacle worthy of the MCU.

They have the ability, like with Civil War, of nailing the characters they direct and write for, with The Black Order outstanding and Thanos on a par with Darth Vader circa Episodes 4-6. Faultless.

I was literally shaking after the first 10 minutes with excitement, as - similar to the first Avengers - each scene just got better and better. And I am fully immersed and up to date with the comics. This film delivers and is faithful to the source material whilst creating its own stories.

I laughed, shed a tear, gasped and just nodded in endless appreciation for managing to live up to all of the hype and all of the expectations I had.

Thank you so much Russo's

I only hope someone pulls Rian Johnson out of his cave, and shows him how a major film should be written and directed in a way that actually exhilarates the audience rather than leaving them with furious disappointment and sheer disgust.

10/10 for Infinity War. I'll be seeing this again and again. Awesome",10
Exceeded all my expectations,27 April 2018,"Avengers infinity war (IW) is, easily Marvel's gutsiest film and definitely its best. Absolutely no doubt about that. The core is pretty simple: Thanos wants the six infinity stones and the broken avengers must stop him before he vanquishes half of humanity. But the key is in the screenplay and direction. What seems impossible on paper is put together almost flawlessly by the Russo brothers.

The standout characters are Thanos, Thor, Gamora and iron man. Not that the others were bad but these 4 were really the cornerstones of the movie. Captain America, Black Panther and Black Widow disappointed a bit because they really didn't do anything apart from punching the enemy.

Marvel finally got the right villain with Thanos and, for the first time I felt for a motion capture character in a live action movie. Josh Brolin is very effective and makes us actually feel something for thanos. You can argue that he's not a villain as his intentions are nice, with only his methods pretty world-ending.

Thor really has great moments in the film and is perhaps at his best even more than in his solo films. Guardians are awesome as always with Gamora making you REALLY emotional. And Iron Man, well, what can we say? Robert Downey Jr just gives you the right balance the character needs, guilt, humour, compassion, bravery. You name it.

Overall, IW is a really great film with super cool VFX (which surprisingly doesn't feel overdone) and great action sequences. Wait for the climax! Just mind blowing and definitely something that you'd not expect in a MCU film.",10

Best marvel film to date,13 April 2019,The film had both amazing acting and an intriguing storyline that keeps you interested from the second it starts till the end.

You'll laugh, you'll cry, and experience most of the emotions in between by the time the 2 hr 29 minutes run time fly's by. By far the best marvel movie to date and will be seeing this movie at least one more time before it leaves the theatres. Ps. I hate you Thanos",10
An Absolutely Beautiful Cinematic Achievement,31 July 2024,"I am HYPED for the Russo Brothers' return! This movie isn't just a beautiful entry of the MCU, it goes to show the amazing cinematic achievement that the MCU has made. There's no doubt that there is a lot of plot lines. Usually, a movie that has this many plot lines would be messy. They just had amazing build up to it, that I was already connected to the characters. So, each plot line was great! It's when they start merging them into one. It goes from all of these plot lines and sub plots, to just two. One with the Guardians, Iron Man, Strange, and Spider-Man. And everyone at Wakanda.

Thanos is definitely one of my all-time favorite villains. He just had such a presence on screen. Josh Brolin was amazing in the role. From the opening of the film to the end. This was a movie with huge stakes, and they were able to pay it off. It isn't exactly a good thing. That just goes to show how great of a standalone story this can be.",10
The best mcu movie of all time,2 November 2023,"This by far is the best MCU in one of the best comic book movies all the time this was set up, so perfectly one of my top five favorite movie of all time the thing that shines the most is Thanos, and the movie made it clear that this was going to be his movie the motivations are very understandable, but also quite evil. All except for some side characters are all utilized and fought with their full potential and cliffhanger at the end was so unexpected and so good that I couldn't wait for part two overall, this is the definition of a fun movie done right while still taking it seriously and still while making a good movie CGI was great to okay. Bruce floating head was very very noticeable Thanos's body was literally like you couldn't notice it, overall this was actually an excellent movie each act from 1st to 3rd was all entertaining and very important to the overall MCU, and with all these characters I'm glad that the writers of the film did not make each character feel like a little pothole. Devils in the movie be utilized every single character today for advantage, and that was really good. 10/10.",10
"If you ever liked a superhero movie, you'll love this (no spoilers)",1 May 2018,"Infinity War contends to be the best movie of the superhero genre ever made. The sheer feat of juggling such a massive cinematic universe and having he pieces land in place is something I would have thought impossible, yet having missed 4 of the 18 movies preceding it (missing Ragnarok was the biggest gap going in) the entire film still flowed incredibly smoothly. I am and know some real hardcore comicbook enthusiasts, and so will there will always be some squandered potential, plot elements that did not fire on all cylinders, or characters we want to see more of, but there are strikingly few missteps to pick out given the scope of this film's ambitions. The incredible number of characters, plot lines and events that fit in here rarely seems ponderous, helped by a script that is laugh-at-loud funny without sacrificing the impact of the third act.

The strongest part of the movie is the villain. Thanos is scarily powerful, and from the very first scene it's clear that he means business. He is charismatic, intelligent, and, once he has the necessary power, pursues his goal with relentless determination. In another world, this movie should have been titled Thanos: Infinity War, because this movie is really his story. His performance and presence are more than enough to forgive his (one exception here) rather forgettable henchmen. However, would I have really wanted them to have more screen time at Thanos' expense? Hell no.

In the end, this movie doesn't work if you haven't spent the time to watch previous movies. If you've read the New Yorker review, the author wastes a lot of ink spelling out ""I haven't watched any of the other movies, so I'm confused and that is YOUR FAULT"". Try watching Return of the King and then leave being mad at the movie for not explaining all the characters (again) for you. These characters don't evolve in this movie, because this movie is about the culmination of all their individual story arcs over the past 10 years. Will that leave some people behind? Of course, but that's the price of admission for a coalescing of a cinematic universe into one movie the likes of which has never been tried before.

Aside: There are some reviews of this movie that are explicitly low because people think that this movie deserves a lower rating than their peers have given it. Retribution against fellow users of this kind seems silly, but there is at least one question raised relevant to the discussion: should fantasy movies like this be rated in the context of other movies of it's kind or should they be seen in the greater context of all cinema. Infinity War isn't as emotionally penetrating as Schindler's list, nor as artistically daring as Mother!, but these are the wrong expectations, at least to me.",9
Hero,30 April 2018,,10
"Big budget, big cast, big bang for the buck - lives up to its hype",26 April 2018,"Since everyone likely to watch this has already seen plenty of Marvel Comics' superhero movies, let's keep this one simple, with a good news-bad news format:

Good - More superheroes appear in this one than you could shake Thor's hammer at. Bad - It's occasionally hard to keep track of who is using which power against which enemy or henchperson thereof.

Bad - It runs 2 ½ hours. Good - The action is so (dare I say?) fast and furious that it sure seems a lot shorter.

Bad - After all that time, the movie ends with a lousy situation, including some surprising deaths, just to set up a sequel. Good - Since the power to control time is one of the themes, maybe the sequel will undo some of the losses we witnessed in this one.

Good - Stan Lee's cameo comes early, allowing focus to remain on the main story. Bad - What could possibly be bad about a Stan Lee cameo? They're always nothing but degrees of good.

Good - Josh Brolin looks and sounds suitably menacing in the role of archvillain Thanos, while also showing more emotional layers than usual for the genre. Bad - The handsome Brolin, in full regalia, bears a shocking resemblance to Ron Perlman, which would be a serious loss of points on the old 1-10 scale if carried over to his real life.

Good - Wonderful comic touches from Robert Downey Jr.'s Iron Man/Tony Stark and the crew from Guardians of the Galaxy. Bad - Much of the action occurs in such dark, ominous settings, creating the impression of DC Comics having invaded this universe. Even Darth Vader would have wanted to redecorate Thanos' spacecraft and environs top cheer the place up.

Bad - Dave Bautista's endearingly dense Drax is getting even dumber. Good - At least his form of stupidity is funny, unlike the same trend in the US Congress.

Good - Thanos' evil plot is to save all the planets in the universe that have become overpopulated by wiping out half of their populations in a single stroke. Since he offs them randomly, he thinks it's fair, making him the ultimate eco-warrior. Bad - See previous comment about US Congress, whose collective thinking is no better.

Good - Scarlett Johansson appears as Black Widow. Bad - She doesn't get enough screen time to display her lithe and lethal skill set to full advantage. Actually, the same pairing applies to lovable tree-creature Groot, but for very different reasons

Bad - The credits are really, really long. Good - The standard teaser after they finally roll past is worth the wait.

Good - Franchise fans (who, unlike me at the time, already know this isn't a one-and-done story line) should be delighted by the script and the overall quality of the production, including all the CGI vistas and mayhem. Go to the biggest screen and most enveloping sound system in driving range, since there's plenty of action worthy of those enhancements. Bad - If you've not already seen a fair share of the zillion movies or read a bunch of the decades of comics featuring Thor, Spiderman, Iron Man and all the other characters converging to defeat this epic threat to the universe, don't start here. You'll be a stranger in a strange land.

In space, no one can hear you bond.",8

This is the beginning of the end of one phase to such an expended universe, and this movie makes it app worth it. If you have not seen this move, HURRY AND GET YOUR TICKETS! IT'S WELL WORTH THE PAY. From beginning to end there is just the right amount of humor mixed with emotions and gut wrenching moments that it was hard for me to sit still in my seats. Dare I say, Josh Brolin plays one hell of a villain (Thanos.) I promise you will feel this characters presence throughout the entire movie. Be glad to know Thanos has earned the spot in the top villains of the MCU which make sense since we've known he existed since 2012's The Avengers.

"A Big, Giant, Entertaining Mess...With One of the Boldest Superhero Endings Ever",6 May 2018,"Pardon the cliché, but Infinity War is truly an emotional roller coaster. Unlike previous entries in this long-running behemoth of super-people, this ride's ascents and dives come faster and furious-er than Vin Diesel driving a sports car through a skyrise window. And (at the risk of really pushing the metaphor) this coaster's biggest drop comes seconds before you exit the ride, leaving audiences with a sense of ""Woah..."", unlike most other comic book films. To clarify, this isn't the best MCU film. For one thing, better entries in the series say something outside of themselves. Iron Man touches on the military-industrial complex. Spider-Man deals with modern-day class issues. All the Captain America entries wrestle brilliantly with government overreach. Infinity War is (for better or worse) focused on plot and character. In spots, it lands its punches (Thor's arc, Thanos' brutality, anything Guardians); in others, it misses (initial attack on NYC, Vision & Scarlet Witch love story, anything Cap). It's a gargantuan undertaking, and your investment in the story and forgiveness of its unwieldiness will only goes as far as your predetermined commitment. If you haven't been keeping up with the franchise (which is essentially a big-budget television show), this is not the episode to jump in on. A 10 years / 18 films / 50+ superheroes bottleneck whose ambition has only been matched by its success. By its very nature, there's only so much you can do to keep this thing from flying off the rails. However, if you're already committed, then the endless barrage of humor and excitement, which crescendos into an unexpected emotional gut-punch, will make for a haunting and bold (though not quite fantastic) Marvel outing.",9

The super heros, vilians, and all the strange creatures have finally meet their faith, in the form of the toughest sob to ever appear in any of the related movies. It doesn't matter who you adore, Thor, Captian America, Hulk, Black Panther, Spider Man, or even Groot - they are all here. And it's not easy. What I loved in this movie is the amount of shocking scenes, and the twists. Excellent plot, script, directing, animation & effects. This movie is a must watch.",10
"Quite possibly, the best movie ever made.",13 February 2019,"I cannot emphasise how good this movie is. It's ridiculously brilliant. The plotting, pace, script, acting, FX. The screen time given to each, of what must be the biggest ensemble of A List stars ever, is nothing short of miraculous. The film is above and beyond the usual superhero fare, the villain, Thanos, is expertly envisioned, played and brought to life by Josh Brolin and is quite possibly the best movie villain ever. As you can imagine, I am biased. I obviously love the genre but that's irrelevant. Before this movie came along, the 1933 version of King Kong was my favourite movie. It may still be when the Marvel Cinematic Universe runs its course but this movie, at the moment, is at No 1. How on earth can Avengers: Endgame top it?",10
Marvel Masterpiece,26 April 2018,"Easily Marvels best film! The Ruso brothers had a tremendous task of taking 10 years worth of Marvel films and putting it together into one epic film, and then succeeded. As for Thanos he's esily the best MCU villain, his character has so much depth, he's not your average bad guy and Josh Brolin plays the Mad Titan so well. I'll be seeing this movie a few more times for sure!",10
One of the best movies in 2018,20 June 2022,"Though I never saw it in theaters when it first came out, Avengers: Infinity War has been one of my favorite movies throughout the years. It is full of comedic, funny movies and some drama. Though it contains some gore, it is expected for a Marvel movie. Yet, in a few spaces, though minimal, it feels stretched out. As stated, this is a rare occasion and are made up for with the comedy based scenes.

Therefore, this movie is what I would consider one of the best of all time.",9

This Movie is worth the Hype. Thanos Rips it.,27 April 2018,,9
The Star Wars movie we never got.,19 May 2018,"So i've been expecting nothing surprising from this movie. Age of Ultron was average, Civil War and Black Panther were horrible and Thor was creativly a little different but still marvel level. But IW really surprised me, i never thought they could make it interesting that everyone fights the same all mighty guy. But lets say they found a clever way that makes perfect sense. The movie itself feels like nice adventure with a lot of different settings and fights. Every character recieves enough time to feel relevant and plot appropiate. The humour is alright and sometimes even funny, never thought my grumpy self could say that. I absolutely despised the comedy in Guardians 2 and especially TLJ. Also Thanos is not a dumb villian Ultron was, he is actually interestingand has motives that one can understand, if to even relate. Thats always what makes good villians shine.

All in all i am very surprised and loved the movie.",9

"Infinity War: Mega Marvel Team-Up Should Thrill Fans, Confuse All Others",31 May 2018,"4 out of 5 stars (one of the best in its series)

Avengers: Infinity War is the culmination of the past 10 years of superhero movies within the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Fans of the franchise will laugh and cry as their favorite heroes go up against the toughest foe they've ever encountered, while non-fans will wonder what all the fuss is about. Essentially, this is a movie for the devotees of this billion-dollar series. If you are not on the Marvel train yet, either engage in a massive binge session to get caught up, or wait until The Incredibles 2 next month for your superhero fix.

The story sees several members of the Avengers team (who are too numerous to mention) battle the malevolent alien Thanos (an intimidating Josh Brolin). Everyone will put their egos aside in order to stop Thanos from getting the magical Infinity Stones and annihilating half of Earth's population.

Avengers: Infinity War will thrill and emotionally devastate series fans, but the uninitiated will be lost. Despite the downbeat tone, the film contains unexpected humor from the character interactions and some of the best action in the franchise. The performances are uniformly strong, and Brolin steals the show as one of the series' best villains. Lastly, the emotionally charged ending is nothing short of heartbreaking for fans, changing the rules for both this universe and superhero films as we know them.

Avengers: Infinity War is a thrilling, fun, and emotional climax to the past 10 years of Marvel's reign over the multiplex. May future installments continue to entertain as much as this.

Earth's Mightiest Movie,30 April 2018,"Avengers Infinity War is the spectacular culmination of 18 previous movies over 10 years that exceeded my expectations! As someone who has followed the marvel universe since it's inception, I can say that this film successfully brings together an enormous cast, a remarkable story, twists that will keep you guessing, serious and gut-wrenching dramatic stakes, and an ending that left me both immensely satisfied and yearning for more at the same time! With a cast of this size, I was worried that the film would be confusing or bloated, but the directors jump from story to story in a way that is very easy to follow and each character gets at least one moment to shine! The antagonists of the majority of the previous entries in the marvel cinematic universe have been characters with no real deapth or motivations that don't entirely make sense, but the mad titan Thanos is quite the exception. Thanos sees himself as the hero of his own story and this movie does an excellent job of making the viewer understand why he does what he does and I empathize with him on some level. This movie has a lot of serious and emotional moments that would make sense for the most part if Avengers Infinty War was your first marvel cinematic universe film, but that being said, those moments are highlighted by context from previous entries in the series, and you would not have the same emotional payoffs you would if you possess at least a general knowledge of the marvel universe. Overall Avengers Infinity War is an excellent film that is not only impressive from its technical achievements, but also for, its superb cast and story that left me eager to see what will happens to earth's mightiest heroes!",10
This movie broke my heart,27 April 2018,"I left the theatre stressed out and sad, but it was awesome. My only complaint is that the CGI was pretty bad at times, especially the green screen.",9
The end is phenomenal,17 February 2019,If you haven't seen this movie your mad. The ending will send chills down your spine and will see you racing back to the cinema for the sequel. The whole movie from start to finish is absolutely incredible.,10
Great movie!!!,28 April 2018,My biggest fear was that they would do the movie a bit like they made Thor Ragnarök with a funny tone and oneliners (loved Thor btw) but they nailed it.,9
"Alright DC Fans,",22 October 2018,"You clearly don't understand that the only good movie DC ever released, was wonderwoman. And i'll give it to you, but marvel breaks the ice here. 18 movies now, and all were better than your hugely dissapointing justice league. I dont care whos more original, but this movie is the breaker. And for those 80 year old grandma's who went to see this with their kid... just stop",10
GARBAGE,30 September 2018,This movie was GARBAGE from the beginning till the end. Too much super heroes. Too much CGI. Zero plot. Everybody sucked in this mess. The Hulk just got on my nerves and i love the guy. Avoid this if you can. It´s just an empty shell. Awful movie.Pure GARBAGE.,1
The Second Best Superhero Movie Ever,27 April 2018,"I'll keep this short.

Avengers: Infinity War is amazing and is a must see. It stands the second best superhero film right behind The Dark Knight. It is intense, sad, and Thanos is one of the best villains I have ever seen on the silver screen.

In short, go see it.",10
Not a huge Marvel Fan but still liked it.,7 May 2018,"Marvel movies are not really my style. I have not seen the first Avengers or most of the previous Marvel Movies but I still thought it was really good. I liked the cast, I was entertained, My kids loved it. I think a wide range of people will like this. It is definitely worth seeing. We probably wouldn't have gone to see this in theaters If we didn't Have MoviePass. We love it. Looking forward to seeing the new Jurassic Park.",8
Avengers: Infinity War,20 May 2018,"Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadger

After 10 years of character and plot building, we finally get what we have been waiting for. Infinity War is a film of epic proportion that makes first Avengers film look like a small feat. Infinity War has a complex story filled with exquisite fight sequences, humor, and amazing characters. The biggest hurdle for this film was fitting in a lot of characters in only two and a half hours. Anthony and Joe Russo successfully give all the characters a fair amount of screen time and introduces use to the amazingly effective Thanos. The story is filled with emotional moments and has some power when it comes to the reality of Thanos' power.

The acting is very good. Robert Downey Jr., Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Don Cheadle, Benedict Cumberbatch, Tom Holland, Zoe Saldana, Chadwick Boseman, Karen Gillan, Tom Hiddleston, Paul Bettany, Elizabeth Olsen, Anthony Mackie, Sebastian Stan, Chris Pratt, and many others perform very well. Josh Brolin performs the best in my eyes. He plays Thanos who is extremely complex and is the second-best superhero villain I have ever witnessed behind The Joker. Thanos truly is the best part of the film in my eyes.

The pacing is perfect. Infinity War throws us into the action immediately and doesn't let up. The runtime is also perfect.

There are a couple of things a didn't like in the film. Peter Dinklage's character looked rather foolish. His accent and the way his character looked made him seem fake. I also didn't like the Wakanda scenes. Their accents are extremely annoying, in my eyes, and some the characters in Wakanda are kinda cringy.

All in all, Avengers: Infinity War is a masterclass superhero film. It is the second-best superhero film ever made right behind Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight. I truly loved it and I am really excited for part two.

Pros: Intense, emotional, and heartbreaking story, good humor, amazing characters, very good acting, Josh Brolin as Thanos, Thanos being one of the greatest movie villains ever, great pacing, a good runtime, and how Thanos is a really effective villain throughout the entire film

Cons: Peter Dinklage's character is and looks bad and most of the Wakanda scenes and characters are kinda cringy

Overall Rating: 9.0",9

Perfect ending to the series Part1,24 July 2023,"Avengers Infinity war is the moment we ve all been waiting for. Since IronMan was released back in 2008 Marvel constantly build up a cohesive story with Captain America and Thor, which eventuall led to the beginning of the avengers. Avengers Infinity war took up all these movies to tell one last story against the hardest villain of all time: Thanos. He is the strongest and mightiest villain yet, so naturally, you would think, that the avengers will defead him, but that is what makes the film so special. All of the established heroes play their role and everybods gets his fair share of screen time and attention, no one is out of character and the acting is brilliant. One last thing, the CGI and music hit different and were brilliantlly combined. The film has its logical problems but after all it repays this with emotional payoffs.",8

This Generation's Empire Strikes Back,17 March 2019,"I've spent over half of my life following these movies waiting for this moment, and I'm not the only one. The Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) is probably the most ambitious project in the history of cinema, and Infinity War is part 1 of the 2 part finale (sort of). With that said, it does NOT disappoint. I have never cried so much in a theater. I have never loved an ensemble of characters so much in any art form (except possibly the comics these films are derived from), and nothing has ever inspired me more. These films are why I became a filmmaker, and you're doing yourself a great disservice if you don't see them.",10
Horrible - frustrating - utterly un-satisfying and INCREDIBLY EMPTY.,29 April 2018,This movie is a very long series of special effects bonanzas / fights and THAT'S IT. It has no purpose - virtually no plot - is endlessly frustrating and at the end feels like you have been promised a trip to Disney World - and you get all excited ( by the marketing / trailers etc . . ) and so you drive for several hours and along the way people in your Car keep being killed in front of you and thrown out of the Car - and right at the end of the trip someone throws YOU out of the Car onto a long desolate road and drives off. SERIOUSLY. That is what watching this incredibly over hyped movie is all about. The VACUUM of EMPTINESS.,1
Heroes at their finest.,25 December 2018,"The dream movie for all Marvel fans. Lots of action, emotions and jokes. Although nkot great. And it does not surpassed Winter Soldier (my favorite MCU movie). Too much changing of scenes that might confuse anyone who haven't watch ALL MCU films.

The best of the MCU!!!,1 May 2018,"I absolutely loved this film....The way it starts is awesome. The action is incredible and almost unmatched by any other MCU film. The finale is a glory to behold as well. The cast does a great job...especially the ""new"" villain Thanos. He's the star here. Hes very very powerful...no spoilers here. The ending is heartbreaking and as good as a cliffhanger as i've seen since Star wars ESB.

DOPE,27 April 2020,"Best avengers movie ever. Great laughs, action, surprises, effects. I watched it 5 times since it came out. no joke.",9
Disappointing Marvel Superhero Epic,28 April 2018,"Unfortunately, this much-hyped Marvel film fails to live up to the hype. The film surrounds basically all characters in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (sans Hawkeye, Ant-Man, and Wasp) as they must fight to stop an evil villain named Thanos, who wants to destroy half the world's population. Josh Brolin does an impressive job voicing Thanos, working to make him both depraved but also somewhat understandable as well. The visual effects are generally impressive, with the notable exception of Thanos' henchmen, whose CGI looks quite cheesy and almost akin to the villains in ""Justice League.""

Unfortunately, ""Avengers: Infinity War"" has an array of flaws. The first flaw is that the movie is almost impossibly convoluted. I consider myself a casual Marvel fan who has seen most MCU movies, and have seen a little over half of them in theaters (Iron Man, Thor, Avengers, Iron Man 3, Thor 2, The Winter Soldier, Guardians of the Galaxy, Age of Ultron, Civil War, Black Panther, Infinity War.) I fully acknowledge the fact that I am unlikely to take away as much from this film as a hardcore fan. However, parts of the film were still difficult to follow--and I followed Civil War just fine. Additionally, while the film is ambitious, it is just unfortunately too overstuffed. There are too many characters and subplots to care about, so much that the audience becomes less engaged in the story until late in the narrative. I believe it would have been better to sort of ""split up"" some non-primary characters between this movie and 2019's ""Avengers 4."" This would allow for audiences to take away more from the two films. While the action is generally thrilling, it lacks a scene that feels wholly unique as compared to other superhero films. The climactic battle in Wakanda shown in the trailers, while a good scene, is pretty similar to other ""large-scale people running"" type battles in movies like the Lord of the Rings series. I guess I was hoping for an action piece that felt really unique to the specific movie itself like Civil War's airport scene or Black Panther's Busan car chase scene. I will not give away any details about the ending, although I will say that it didn't work for me and made it hard for me to suspend disbelief.

Due to its overstuffed nature and overtly convoluted plot, I cannot say this film met my expectations. 5/10

Note: I saw this movie in IMAX 3D. The picture and sound quality were both very good, although the 3D was weak and did not really add anything.",5

One of the best MCU films,26 April 2018,"A fantastic sequel and one of the finest of the MCU. It was not perfect but it was hell of a fun film with more twists than all those films combined. I think it was a very challenging task to bring all these characters together but it worked. I really loved the new combinations and relationships of the different characters which were incredibly dynamic. Also the portray of Thanos was fantastic. Sure they could have worked a little more on the effects but he way the character was written was excellent and extremely unexpected because it was not the kind of one dimensional and boring villain I would have expected. They really gave him a lot of soul and possibly more than any of the other characters with the exception of Zoe Saldana's Gamora, which marks Saldana's best turn with that character. Robert Downey Jr. was his usual self but more fun than in this latest Tony Stark appearances. Chris Evans was rather boring. Chris Hemsworth was pretty fine. Chris Pratt (jeez too many Chris's) was funny and self ironic. Scarlett Johansson was a bit wasted. I am not really fond on the direction they develope Bruce Banner/Hulk and Ruffalo can do better. Nice to see Chadwick Boseman so short after his own adventure again. Tom Holland really developed into the best Spider-Man. Really liked his performance here again. The visuality was great. Most of the action scenes just brilliantly executed. The score was great. I had many shivers down my spine. The ending was shocking , but I somehow can imagine how they will continue and in which direction the last sequels goes. Great entertainment with a lot of tense, heart, soul and surprisingly moving moments.",9

It has the must needed action that everyone is desperate to see. And without a doubt you most certainly get that. It has such a drive throughout the film for Thanos to achieve his goal, but the Avenger and GOTG give a good game. It has outclassed the previoud Avengers and gives you that better build up that everyone has longed for! That's having every superhero who's been on the screen put together. To me that film was that good I could never get bored of it and I already want to go and watch it again a thousand times over.

It is also irritating (after all of that screen time) to be held hostage to a short scene after a long, I mean long, credit role.

The most ambitious film project has arrived,27 April 2018,"The most anticipated crossover presents us the search for the infinity stones by one of the best villains in the cinema in general ... Thanos the ""crazy titan"" that had been shown to us from the post-credit scene of The Avengers in 2012, after a Great cameo in Guardians of the galaxy in 2014 and for the last time in the post credit scene of Avengers age of Ultron. The film focuses on showing us why Thanos wants to opt for all the infinity strones since he believes that with them he could bring balance to the universe by annihilating half of it, and thus save it from itself, because of the overpopulation and lack of resources in the universe . The movie is full of epicity, insertity, and is full of surprises, the whole ensemble of characters is perfectly balanced. All the characters retain their personality, and shine one by one, the teams are fantastic. The action is unexpected, from the first minute of the pecula there are completely epic ballas and with good choreography, the tension is felt throughout the film being sanded with classic MCU humor no joke feels forced, they are necessary to release tension. The end of the movie is something so unexpected and surprising, without a doubt it is the best movie of superheroes in history, and it becomes more than that since it has a plot that is totally well realized and a villain who is totally well written that ends up being the protagonist of this epic infinity war that leaves us thinking seriously about the future of our heroes and the MCU.",9
Possibly the most anticipated film of the year finally hits the big screen but is it really that big?,26 April 2018,"REVIEW - AVENGERS INFINITY WAR

Possibly the most anticipated film of the year finally hits the big screen but is it really that big?

Big cast Big special effects Big action Big villain Big silence

The problem with the marvel universe is that they announce films far too early.

Let me try to explain.

Imagine that a hero gets killed off but you already know their sequel is being made and is due out next year. Would their death have as much of an impact?

Yes if you don't know their sequel was being made but confusing if you did.

I can't and as usual won't give too much away but all I will say is there are 2 scenes that are pivotal to the part 2.

One involving Dr Strange and the 14 million and 6 possible outcomes and the party involving Starlord slipping Thanos.

I would guess that these 2 scenes set up part 2 out next year.

Story easy to follow.

Can be confusing figuring out who all of the characters are especially as Captain America is now not in his Red White and Blue uniform / costume.

There is a lot to see and it is worth doing so on the large screen but I didn't leave feeling blown away and I honestly can't figure out why?

One Helluva Ride!,28 April 2018,"After the over-hyped disappoint that was Blank Panther, I now get why BP was important. Thor 3 was so much better than BP, but again, important.

Infinity War starts with a bang and just doesn't let up. It has all the right snippets of comedy, tragedy, and some very unexpected moments. We finally get Thanos and understand why he is who he is and what he's after. All the MCU movies are tied in and, for me, there were a couple characters that showed unexpectedly!

The film ends with a great cliffhanger and you need to wait until the VERY END of the credits.

If Infinity War doesn't bypass Black Panther in gross sales, then there's a conspiracy at foot!!",10

I'm sitting in my house tonight. I'm not an old man but I'm not young either.

It's like new comic book day. Because what I saw tonight was the best new comic I've read in years. Infinity War begins hard. And it never lets up. I'm amazed. Shocked. Crying. Laughing. And now...? Everybody knows. Or they will.

Avengers: MASTERPIECE,20 May 2018,"It was a hell of a ride! No word needed...simply amazing! So good characters development. So many emotions, so much fun, so much energy, so much tears...ending was just like woe, breathless and emotional. So many characters but each one of them was great presented! After 10 years everithing came together, on the other hand fell apart...so much depth in this story! Congrats MARVEL! I am with you till the end of the line!!!!",10
Best superhero movie !,25 March 2019,Pure comic book masterpiece The way Thanos was performed by josh Brolin was amazing,10
Powerful Movie,23 June 2022,,9
AWESOME,25 May 2018,This movie is one of the best I have seen in a while. The chemistry between characters is amazing (best was Doctor Strange and Ironman) and the action was incredible. Thanos is not like other Marvel villains he thinks he is saving the world and he cares. The cameos were spot on and didn't feel awkward about them and the story itself was phenomenal. The ending was probably the best and worst part of the movie and once it ends you won't be able to stop thinking about it. The one problem with this is that it will not be a good movie if you haven't seen the other big MCU movie. 11/10,10
Amazing movie,28 April 2018,Looking forward for part two We love each part of it and the comic era is and add value we understand the food drama and eliminating half of the galaxy but avebgaers tram works is amazing,10

A MUST WATCH (preferably on the BIGGEST screen possible) !!,27 October 2019,"It is finally here.. the culmination of 10 years of multiple MCU story lines spanning 18 movies and ship-load of superheroes and their support cast which we have grown to love.

Thanks to the well orchestrated marketing campaign as well as the gradual buildup over the years through all the story arcs converging to this climactic showdown, the tsunami of expectations for Infinity War had hit a crescendo before the release.

Credit to the director duo of Russo brothers who have managed to deliver despite such stupendous expectations and hype.

The movie is chock-a-block with our favourite superheroes and towering above all of them, is their nemesis - the mad titan Thanos who spells death, doom and destruction from the word go, as he sets out on a quest to capture all six infinity stones which would make him the most powerful entity of the universe.

While the narrative is indeed weighed down by the sheer mass of the material on hand and the multiple characters vying for screen-time, the directors have managed to provide space for almost all of them to come into their own.

Given the scale of the challenge at hand, the sinister designs of Thanos and his team and his superlative power which continues to multiply as the movie progresses, there is a palpable dark tinge that permeates the movie. Despite being shrouded under the dark cloud of impending doom an gloom, the narrative is frequently funny with clever cracking quips coming from the clash of several superhero sized egos as well as genuinely tongue-in-cheek conversations as all these characters get to know each other.

The action is often frenetic and the set pieces are brilliantly mounted on a dazzling scale with scope for almost every character to shine in brief bursts. In a movie of this scale, with more superhero per minute than any other venture, Josh Brolin is impressively menacing as the invincible, Thanos who seeks to bring balance to the universe even if it involves wiping half of all lives, including many of our favourite superheroes, at the snap of his fingers.

While some of the outcomes are on expected lines as indicated in the many trailers and teasers, the Russo brothers have packed quite a few nasty surprises that could leave the audience gawking, especially - an epic cliffhanger ending.

As the dust settles after a feverish run-time of almost 160 minutes and an audacious climax (yup every minute counts.. including the end credit scene), the audience are left at a perilous precipice that is shocking and desperately seeking answers to multiple questions from the sequel that is slated to hit the screens next year.

Till then... we are left to MARVEL ... What could be lying beyond this insidious infinity ?",9
The Great Titan of the Box Office!,6 July 2018,This movie is fantastic. Got me gasping and laughing constantly. Loved every single second of it. Cannot wait to see where this goes onto Avengers 4 and beyond. Absolutely recommend watching this! 5/5!,10
God damn.,26 April 2018,"That's all I can say. This movie could have gone so incredibly wrong with all it's potential to fulfill, but it goes so incredibly right. The shifts in tonal voice and feel, the balance between the superheroes and their abilities, the choreography of the fight scenes, the smooth dialogues, the humor, the emotions - it could not have been done better. I'm baffled by how they were able to pull this off. The only thing that could have lifted the experience for me was if Ebony Maw (black order) was voiced by Bill Nighy - but that's just sugar coating the cherry on top.",10
"A thoroughly enjoyable, quality action piece with a nerve raw heart...",14 February 2020,"...a great mashup of genres, some hilarious moments, creative action, a fantastic arc for the mad Titan Thanos, and a brilliant concoction of bringing together all the disparate threads generated over however many filmmakers and agendas over however many years. It's certainly a film that requires previous knowledge and it's certainly the first of two films but on a second watch the film breathes and its juggling of tones and steady hand under the Russo's is very clear. It's an event film and is in a class amongst the best we have these days. I was overly critical the first time but this time I enjoyed it for exactly what it was and appreciated its flow and clarity and quality. It's clever and fun and certainly a benchmark.",8
Brilliant performance,12 November 2018,"1. Story brilliantly written and executed but some where things were not explained in rush 2.

Overall movie is good and outstanding in case of performance",9
Loved the film and hated it at the same time......,29 April 2018,,8
"Louder, Longer, Less plot - Groot has the best tool: an iPod..........",18 August 2018,"Louder, Longer, Less plot - Groot has the best tool: an iPod.......... There is an audience (and a massive one willing to pay big bucks and stand in long lines ) who champion all of the Marvel Comics films. AVANGERS INFINITY WAR is no exception. At over two and a half hours even the huge cast of gifted actors - at their bet when being funny - explode, blow up things, zoom into outer space for a mission to find Thanos who goal is to rule the universe by obtaining all the funky jewels for his glove - all seem to wear thin from the plodding 'plot' and turn to dust.

The true 'stars' of this huge effort are f course the CGI team - the special effects are truly spectacular, at least for the first hour. The characters don't get much time to develop but the actors assigned to the strange roles make the Avengers and their enemies entertaining. The 'plot'? 'As the Avengers and their allies have continued to protect the world from threats too large for any one hero to handle, a new danger has emerged from the cosmic shadows: Thanos. A despot of intergalactic infamy, his goal is to collect all six Infinity Stones, artifacts of unimaginable power, and use them to inflict his twisted will on all of reality. Everything the Avengers have fought for has led up to this moment - the fate of Earth and existence itself has never been more uncertain.'

Cast includes Robert Downey Jr., Chris Helmsworth, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Don Cheadle, Benedict Cumberbatch, Tom Holland Chadwick Boseman, Zoe Saldana, Tom Hiddleston, Paul Bettany, Anthony Mackie, Idris Elba, Peter Dinklage, Vin Diesel, Benecio Del Toro, Chris Pratt, William Hurt, Josh Brolin, Gweneth Paltrow, Bradley Cooper etc etc etc. Definitely a film for those who follow Marvel Comics - or those who need an escape form the chaotic world we inhabit. 'That's entertainment?'.",3
Everything Is Awesome But a Little Bit Disappointing,28 April 2018,,8
Infinity War - the War has begun,2 May 2018,"Infinity War deserves to be one of the best Marvel movie to have come out, if not the best. It truly combines all characters into a single story telling which is well laid out and gives every character a chance to shine.

Without going into the story and spoilers, I will highlight the pros and cons of the movie

Pros: Thanos - after a decade of waiting we get to see him and he does not disappoint at all

Characters - most of the characters are in the film except of Hawk eye (whom I never liked) and AntMan. Each character gets good screen time especially Thor and Iron man and surprisingly Spider-Man too

Story - story is not so complex and continues where Thor 3 and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2 and CA Civil War ended. You will easily follow it if you can stay up for two and half hour

Cons Thanos - yes that is true. There is no doubt he did an amazing job but his portrayal wasn't all that. I wished to see him in his full armor suit but he was bare head. Also he's supposed to be strong overall but movie seems to show the infinity stone makes him stronger

Missing characters- AntMan was missing and I have no idea why. No Captain Marvel cameo

End credit - there are end credit scene but you have to wait 15 mins for it after entire credit roll out and the scene is barely 20 sec

Ending - by the time movie finish you will know this is just the beginning. The entire movie was focus on Thanos collecting the infinity stone. What he is going to do with it is probably in the next infinity War

Climax - this was the let down for me. First the main fight takes place in an open ground of Wakanda. Second so many creatures took most of the screen time that Thanos himself comes at the end and the fight is very small. There was no scene at the end where all avengers jump on him to fight him (beside the scene at Titan where Ironman Spider-Man and doctor strange all fight him at once which was a better scene than final battle). This was a major let down also because the final scene was on open ground and not in the main city. Once one small scene in the beginning was shot in NYC which was pretty small and quick.

Scenes - some of the scene in trailer were not in the film it could be they are part of Infinity War II since they shot both films together

Hulk - no hulk smashing this time since Bruce banner had trouble becoming a hulk he is given a hulk buster armor

Overall the movie scores 8/10 on my scale and I hope the next part fills in the gap that were missed in Infinity War",8

Seeing that this one has been rated 8.5 makes me lose faith in people,16 June 2019,"No plot, lots of bangs, confusing, full of cliches. What else can I say?",1
You are not prepared.,27 April 2018,"You are not prepared. You may believe you are, even if you have seen every trailer, every TV spot, every leaked set photo, you are not prepared for the Infinity War.

All has led to this. A spoiler free analysis follows.

Previously I've been blogging a series of retrospective posts chronicling the past films that are a part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), their impact on the larger narrative, and discussing Marvel's growth as a film studio over the past 10 years and 18 films. Ever increasing budgets aside, the films have grown ever larger in their grander context of the larger scope of the MCU. An early criticism was the way they sloppily shoehorned connections between films, which has matured to become a subtle art of careful structure. Avengers Infinity War, however, is fully aware that the connective tissue strewn about the past 18 films has always had one end game, the villain Thanos, and his enigmatic ultimate goal. This review will not have any story spoilers beyond what has been shown in the first trailer released what seems like so very long ago.

This is important to note as seeing the film with eyes as fresh as possible is a requirement not exclusively meant for the rabbid fans that have been clamouring for this film since they first cracked open a comic book in their youth, but as it turns out, also the unwashed masses who may have only seen a smattering of previous films. You may have only seen Black Panther, or been here since the first Iron Man, but the story will still surprise you and overwhelm you with emotions, as even though knowledge of the previous films is a pre-requisite to fully engaging with the story, the writers have so perfectly crafted the narrative as to add weight and substance to every scene, even if you may not know the intricately detailed back story to a character's actions. This applies even to Thanos, the big bad originally teased in the first Avengers so very long ago, the Mad Titan's motivation is so skillfully manifested throughout the film as to make him a sympathetic character, you of course won't agree with his methods but you will come to understand his reasons so clearly that it puts so many comic book movie baddies to shame.

Avengers Infinity War is unquestionably the biggest superhero film ever put before celluloid, or in this case, IMAX cameras. It's notable that this is the first Hollywood production to be shot entirely using IMAX cameras, cameras known for being used most often for nature documentaries due to the unrivalled visual fidelity and highly engrossing aspect ratio that pulls the viewer into any given scene. This is no less true for Avengers, the film is very obviously designed with the large aspect ratio IMAX presents as each shot beautifully paints a larger than life image, as needed for such larger than life characters. Characters, who after all this time, are still receiving incredible depth of development even though they share the screen with upwards of 60 total characters. And the way the film juggles so many characters vying for screen time in such disparate circumstances is a master class in story telling and film editing.

As a fan of all things geeky, specifically superheroes, and most specifically the MCU, of which I have seen each film many times over and already had my tickets to see Infinity War a second time before having even seen it once, I knew I would like this movie, I was ready to crown it my new favourite comic book movie, period. However, I can momentarily put aside my Hulk sized bias and state objectively that the film works, and against all odds. It takes the narrative promises it's laid out the last 10 years and weaves them so deftly as to seem effortless. You will laugh, you will cry, you will gasp in utter disbelief, and then immediately buy another ticket on your way out.",10

I felt as though the humor was very well balanced. The action was choreographed soo well.

Great fun but plot doesn't track.,29 April 2018,"The movie was a lot of fun and more than up to Marvel's high standards, but the plot line doesn't track. If the infinity stones are so powerful and so dangerous, and in the hands of Thanos can give him the power to wipe out half the universe, then why not just gather them up and take them to the mega-sized black hole at the center of our galaxy and launch them into the gravity well? Once they are sucked in past the event horizon, NOTHING, not even Thanos can get them back. And if there is any blow-back from the infinity stones as they are being destroyed, compared to the size and power of a giant black hole that sucks in star systems, planets, and other black holes for a daily snack, they would be nothing. Anything as dangerous as these stones, no one should be able to have.",8

Just Wonderful,17 February 2020,"I'm gonna keep this short because you've heard this everywhere, but Avengers: Infinity War is amazing. Probably my favorite film out of the MCU. With the amount of characters in this film the Russo Brothers had to juggle, it's astonishing this movie worked. Every character felt like they were apart of the movie in a good enough way, there was a perfect balance of screen time. And they managed to write Thanos as one of the best villains EVER. Visual effects are perfect, I mean what else do you want. This movie also had a whole lot of hype around it and it was one of my most hyped movies of all time. Infinity war gets a 10/10",10

Visual and Action Extravaganza,27 April 2018,"The Avengers super-mash-up has out-done itself once again: more heroes, fiercer baddies, grander scope, and greater peril. It's almost too much and yet not enough in other ways, because the screen time for many characters get spread so thin. Assuming you have seen most of the MCU movies up to this point, you'll appreciate that a handful of the characters previously under-developed have gotten more attention, but many of the favorites who were previously better-developed got barely enough time to be a cue for a crowd cheer. For some of them, it felt like the actors/actresses couldn't even get into character or understand the context of the scene -- one may posit that the secrecy over the whole plot had a negative impact on their performances.

While the heroes may have come from the pages of comic books, their foes seemed to have come from grotesque video games. The setup is familiar: the big-bad has a handful of one-dimensional lieutenants and a horde of violent minions/beasts/robots/whatnot. However, I would say that Thanos was the star of the show, in a way we haven't seen nor talked about since the first Avengers (the enigmatic Loki). Not only is Thanos powerful, but this Mad Titan has some depth, development, and determination that's typically reserved the good guys.

This is an epic that I will surely like to watch again soon, because so much just whizzed by in a blur the first time, and there was more than one reason for that! This was my first visit to a new-ish 3D venue that might need to have some kinks worked out, because I felt the visuals were really muddy and dizzying during many fast action sequences -- more than the usual 3D blur. Maybe it was a technical issue with this particular showing, but personally I would recommend going to a non-3D showing.",8

ABSOLUTE PERFECTION,18 August 2023,This movie is everything a movie should be. It combines everything the prequals have done to build up this franchise throughout the last twenty years and finally after all this time we get infinity war. Combining different groups of heroes such as the avengers and the guardians of the galaxy fighting together to stop the all evil and powerful thanos was a immaculate cinematic experience which can't be replicated. All of these stories coming together and watching them all fight alongside each other really takes story telling to another level which this movie does incredibly well. The movie flows perfectly and honestly there's nothing to say that could downgrade it's status.,10

I mean sure that thanos is not the same one from the original comics, but the Russos and the writers wanted to make thanos more like a sympathetic character and I believe that all those haters of this movie are so negative because they're trying to curse Marvel Studios. Don't listen to these haters, idiots and critics who are trolling Infinity War. Just go and watch this movie while you still have the chance, and try to enjoy it like I did.

Emotional roller coaster,27 April 2018,"This is everything I hoped for. I have waited for infinity war for so long and I didn't try for once to lower my expectations because I simply couldn't, i went to the movie with high expectations and boy it DELIVERED. I cried three separate times in those two and a half hour period. The movie was intense, the crowd was intense and everything was intense. Most people were setting on edge and are so locked with the story and the characters. You don't feel overwhelmed by the huge amount of characters and storylines and i think the editing -which was so so so beautiful done- had a huge impact on that Now I'm not going to spoil anything but i have to say Tom holland's performance in one particular scene was so beautiful and heartbreaking and the acting was overwhelmingly good. He never fails to amaze me. Going to this film I heard people say how heartbreaking , sad and dark it is and I thought i was ready for it but I wasn't and I don't think you will.

Some characters that looked like they were going to a big part in the movie were in it for like 2min. Overall it was a big let down because I had been waiting forever for this movie to come out and I was actually exited. My advice, save your money and wait until the infinity war 2 comes out.

Directors made it best as possible",10
"Best Superhero film ever made, better than any expectation",26 April 2018,"SPOILER FREE review

Let's clarify first: This film is an important part of series of MCU films. Watching as standalone movie is not recommended. Just like you will not watch only the last episode of Game of Thrones. Watch the previous films before Infinity War!! (you can skip Iron man 2-3, Incredible Hulk tough)

So what can i tell about the movie? I got everything i expected, everything i hoped for, everything i dreamed of and even much more:

What i expected: A MCU film with well placed humor, awesome fight scenes, well done CGI.

What i hoped for: I hoped they can handle the awesome amount of characters while they had to build up Thanos too. I can tell you guys, character chemistry is working (my favourites Strange-Ironman-Starlord; Thor-Rocket Raccoon), I hoped for an good challenging villain. I got it, Thanos is one of the best MCU villain every way. I hoped for a fast paced story, full of tragic moments (PEGI 16), surprising story events. Marvel got balls, this style should be forced for later mainstream films. (More jokes, lighter tone should be made at standalone movies, like Ant Man, Spiderman Homecoming etc.)

What i dreamed of: Usually these are story elements, and spoiling them would be a sin.

and much more: We have new side character and his own tragedy and there is one guy you will never see that coming. Clever use of Infinity Stones Interesting places Backstories ...

So as a summary i can say this film is beyond any expectation, there are only minor flaws which are acceptable comparing to the job they did . This is so epic, spectacular for becoming the a comparison basis for later films. ""There is no decision making process here"", this is a 10/10 film ( I only gave 10/10 for the ""Avengers"" among superhero movies before)",10
One of the best movie i watched till a date,27 April 2018,"Russo brother have developed master piece with well developed characters. Movie is going really fast with parallel stories.

Marvel's unique distance to heros in its belief in every humane heroes,28 April 2018,"I love the Marvel's unique conviction in its distance to ""chosen"" heroes in its strong belief and affection in cohabitation of diverse every humane heroe's affection. That includes Ironman and Spider-Man Dr.Strange Rabit Groot Gamora etc all the diverse life based on their core idea to live together in peace without fear in the universe space without violent conquer. This all star movie Avengers Infiniti War, however, or, exactly saying, that is why, teases audeiemce's strong tendency to rely on all star heroes power. Marvel, as it always does, describes the real world where killers go on killing in ""justification"" of any sorts of even in manipulation of mentality and humane strength and weakness in love and hate. Avengers Infiniti War - is exactly the world of truth seriously commuting to and diggin into reality with humour, in reflecting exactly the real world where I and all star casts or even producers directors all the Marvel studio itself facing up with in every day production process and every day life of their own. That was even shown in its reflection of the latest ""science"" to be technically implemented into real practical weapon in near future. And that is why this movie is ""to be continued"" in audiences' sense of sadness in the sadness (in a sense of expected even without any spoiler"" ) and asking or putting audiences into the position to think of the measures that they can do to solve the situation with production. This movie is dragging audience into the bottom of the mud where this world or areas have been sticking into. Marvel movies Ironman Spider-Man Avengers etc including Avengers Infiniti War are brilliant because Marvel movies always bring audience into the real problems the earth is facin up with in its very unique way that no other film can do but marvel movies",9
Absolutely Brilliant,28 April 2018,"What a show! The characters are all amazing...the feeling of enormous impact is totally palpable throughout the movie...the comedy is on point and Thanos is quite possibly the best MCU villain ever!

Beyond My Expectations,12 April 2019,"Infinity Wars was a breathtaking film. It knocked the wind out of me, on the edge of my seat, wondering what would happen next. I needed to know. It was very exciting and intriguing to watch them. Almost everyone started breaking into sobs while the ending happened, now, I'm not going to tell what happened, because I hate when someone spoils a film for me, so I won't do that for other people. It was intriguing, and packed full of action. It was amazing to see all the Marvel Avengers group together and reunite. Some things were completely unexpected, which made it so worth it to watch. If you haven't, watch Infinity Wars.",9

Too much of everything,29 April 2018,"Though surprisingly rich, the film's storyline remains incomplete. Feels more like several movies squished together. ""Avengers: Infinity War"" isn't a perfect film, but it's probably exactly what it wants to be. A massive spectacle full of fun character moments and impressive action sequences. It is an entertaining movie but one that leaves too many unanswered questions. Also it is too long, too dark and too confusing but the humor and all star cast helps you endure the overrunning length. On the whole, ""Infinity War"" is what fans have been clamoring for - an action movie that puts everyone under one cinematic roof, that puts all the good guys against the ultimate big bad for a better universe.",5

The grand rehearsal before the groundbreaking act,23 April 2019,"I remember when the first Avengers movie came out all people lost their minds from the biggest crossover of superheroes in history; six years later the snowball has gotten bigger and now the boulder of awesomeness is rolling to crash us.

The trait of Marvel that has always attracted me is that every film is a part of an enormous puzzle that leads to the picture that stands out from everything that we have ever seen. A continuous story leaves no choice but to take a hold of the feelings from the last chapter and ride that wave again with all the worries and excitement.

The scale of the performance is gigantic - it's not a brawl on the streets, not a journey between two cities, the action is literally everywhere. All the characters that throughout the history of the universe caught our eye are there in one way of another, not every one of them knows each other but in the face of the grave danger they will have the acquaintance of their lives.

A rather fast change of sets does not let you rest and prepares all the ingredients for the main dish that will be served afterwards. Overall the motivation of the characters is straight and understandable, however, some decisions don't show lazy writing but are there to screw with the future of the universe and could have been avoided with a snap of fingers.

I totally agree that Thanos is one of the greatest villains of all time: ready to do whatever it takes to reach the goal and the sweetest part is that he is unpredictable as hell and considering that he increases his power with every step the fate of our heroes is in constant and imminent threat.

The hallmark of Marvel is a solid plot with ultra-quality effects and this case is not an exception. Multiple incredible eye-pleasing moments leave you with an open mouth and keep making you wonder if ever the imagination well of screenwriters will dry out.

Recovering from one of the best cliffhangers of the recent years I will say that 'Infinity war' is so far one of the best movies of the MCU - nearly perfect roller-coaster of emotions accompanied by superb score. Let's hope that from this beautiful egg will hatch an outstanding creature that will live in our memory forever.",9
"The best Avengers film, by far",12 October 2023,"In 2018, Marvel finally released its most ambitious project as an unprecedented gathering of comic-book superheroes faced one powerful enemy in Avengers: Infinity War, the third and most epic in scale of all the Avengers films.

If there's one thing Marvel has excelled at so far, it's build-ups. Whether it was slowly but surely leading us to that very first crossover, Captain America: Civil War or this latest intergalactic adventure. Having everyone's favorite heroes facing Thanos (a mo-caped Josh Brolin) in a huge battle spanning at least two films was the plan ever since we first met the Avengers so seeing such a bold project come to fruition at last is quite an achievement in itself. Of course, making such a packed crossover not only make sense but having it be actually good was the real challenge.

Luckily, juggling multiple characters isn't something that Marvel has had much trouble with so far and, indeed, Infinity War does have a story that (mostly) works and isn't too tough to follow. Unlike the first Avengers film, however, which required viewers to have only passing knowledge of each character, Infinity War demands familiarity with most prior movies and this might alienate those more casual of viewers who might have skipped one or two along the way. That said, there's plenty of exposition to make sure that, at the very least, everyone will know who Thanos is, what he's up to and why that matters.

The plot sees the aforementioned big bad attempt to gather all of the Infinity Stones, which would give him the power to eradicate half of the universe effortlessly in order to, he believes, save life itself. He first encounters Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and Loki (Tom Hiddleston) then sets his sights on Earth where he sends his team to recover two of the stones. Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), with the help of Spider-Man (Tom Holland) and Dr. Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), attempts to bring the fight to Thanos' home of Titan while Captain America (Chris Evans), Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) and the rest of the Avengers try to destroy Vision's (Paul Bettany) stone without killing him while they battle countless alien creatures in Wakanda.

Meanwhile, we follow Thor and the Guardians Of The Galaxy as the former tries to find a new Mjolnir-like weapon and the latter attempt to rescue Gamora (Zoe Saldana) from her father Thanos who needs her to find one of the stones. This is obviously a busy film and it does jump around quite a bit but it doesn't waste too much of its time, although Thor's entire quest and a handful of jokey back-and-forths do slow things down a tad.

There is a lot of fun to be had in Infinity War: seeing Star-Lord (Chris Pratt), Rocket Raccoon (Bradley Cooper) and the rest of the Guardians interact with the likes of Thor and Tony Stark is a treat, there's plenty of humor thrown in (sometimes too much of it) and the action scenes are impressive. Comic-book fans should have a ball watching all these characters interact with each other, use their powers at the same time and try to take down the toughest team of bad guys yet.

The pacing could have been a bit more consistent as some of the side plots can drag a bit and, even though the darker, apocalyptic tone set by a character like Thanos should clash with the playfulness of the heroes, one can't help but feel that some scenes should have been trimmed a bit to make the whole thing flow a little better. There are also so many characters to keep track of that some big names like Captain America or Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) don't really get much screen-time and others, like Ant-Man, Hawkeye and many more, are simply absent, though these loose ends will obviously be explained in the next instalment.

While previous Avengers films may have been little more than spectacle big on fan service and short on plot, Infinity War has some depth to it thanks to a genuine threat that finally challenges all the heroes to their very core. The intimidating Thanos doesn't disappoint in terms of what he puts the Avengers through, from the way in which he disposes of major characters in the very first scene to how he handles the people he supposedly cares about and, of course, the inevitably bleak third act. The film makes a point of showing us, not just what Thanos wants and how far he's willing to go to get it, but also who he is and what his (flawed) motivations are.

We despise yet understand him and he's the only character in the film to not crack jokes at inappropriate times so all this makes him one of the most consistent and well-defined villains in the MCU, as well as the most threatening by far. His alien henchmen are a lot more one-dimensional but they keep the Avengers busy while Thanos isn't around. Expect plenty of cool surprises, including after the credits and, although the ending is a downer, it should get you excited for the next film plus the arrival of new characters in solo outings.

Another massive gamble from Marvel pays off brilliantly as we are served another big, entertaining and well made blockbuster with a charming all-star ensemble cast, lots of action and one heck of a scale. The fan service, silly conversations and distracted structure might alienate non comic-book fans but those familiar with all the movies, at least, should have a great time with this one.

Solid, if occasionally messy, fun.",8

Well Done!!!,27 April 2018,MCU does not play around.... I'm sad for the loses... but damnnn what a movie....,10
Programmed to false hype.... Again,29 April 2018,"Yes, history repeats itself. The black panther phenomenon is back, now renamed as infinity war. An avengers' film didn't need all that false hype to reach 600 million, I supposed. The boldest superhero movie ever that could kill off any of its heroes just for the sake of making a masterpiece? Well, we are not so lucky, superheroes are for children because they don't die. They return, as multi million dollar potential still remains. So what's the point of fooling with incorrect ideas posted smartly to make one think otherwise. The secret lies with kids. No matter how mature or philosophical they pretend to be, a belief still remains that these works need grown up kids or real ones to break records. It's this idea that this film strengthens, putting Christopher Nolan's hard work to dust. And yet all this hype has found takers. In the world of today, humans too can be programmed (skynet beware). It happens so that mass hysteria gives way to a prolonged hypnosis that hinders the truth from coming out. There were times when bad films finally got what they deserved. But now it seems humans have gradually transformed into bots. A majority view is now a bot's view, programmed to perfection. The movie industry is now devoid of its stories, superheroes don't die, but stories do. What's left is a mishmash of all the same. Now about the movie: weak plot, weak execution, with bits of unwanted comedy and no change. The future will be more of the same.",4

Amazing movie,27 May 2018,"The movie is well sequenced and the characters looked amazing in the movie, the story line is followed accordingly, however the length of the movie may be a little too Long, but overall the movie is really a must watch for marvel lovers",9
The best Marvel Movie to date,14 May 2018,"There, I said it. This is arguably the best Marvel movie to date. In objective terms. It is the 19th movie from the MCU and a true masterpiece. When I've first seen the trailer I got hyped just like everybody else. The trailer was just that good. Credit, where credit's due. But this; it's even better than I expected it to be.

The thing that resonated with me the most was the constant tension in the movie. Right from the start you get this uneasy feeling that things are about to go horribly wrong as Thanos and his henchmen confront some of the Avengers in the first act of the movie. We as the viewers are immediately getting a taste of how powerful Thanos really is. The aforementioned heroes serve as a subjective metric in this scenario. We don't need to know how they got there or what exactly preceded that event. All we need to know is that the earth and its inhabitants are in grave danger, and this is the message that the first act communicates clearly. It's masterfully executed, no fluff, it just goes straight into the action.

Unlike in previous Marvel movies this time the threat is nominal and also directed towards the heroes and not just mankind. I don't know if you noticed but up until this point the Marvel movies followed, more or less the following pattern: villain emerges, threatens mankind, superheroes feel the urge to intervene, final showdown, happy ending. This time however the tables are turned. Because unlike in the other movies the heroes have no choice but to fight for their lives. So naturally, the movie assumes a much more serious tone. This is a literal life or death situation. In the previous movies the superheroes didn't really have to intervene, no matter how big the threat was. With the sole exception of Ultron of course, but once you realize that he was created by the superheroes it's nothing but ""damage control"". To conclude: the stakes have never been higher. This is the final showdown we've all waited for. All the other 18 movies that preceded this one come full circle as the pieces fall into place.

Some people have voiced complaints, claiming that the movie is just an endless deluge of fighting scenes. But that's not quite right. Yes, there are a lot of fighting scenes but this is not the main focus of this movie. It's more of a philosophical inquiry. A somewhat interesting meditation on nihilism as a whole. Yes, Thanos is pretty much the embodiment of nihilistic thoughts, whether he realizes it or not. I mean, what could be more nihilistic than to enact a genocide on a cosmic scale? Not much.

With that being said this movie could easily be interpreted as an ingenious metaphor for the current state of affairs. Nihilism is on the rise among younger demographics and it is becoming a really big problem. It's a cultural phenomenon that's slowly eating away at the foundations that helped necessitate our modern society. I don't know if this is what the writers had in mind when they wrote the script but that's how I interpret it.

There is one thing that irked me a little about the movie, though. Thanos' motivation was never really touched upon in the movie. Without a tangible motive his actions seemed a little far fetched, you see. But then again, I can't exactly criticize this movie too much for this lack of information since it's a two-part movie. I mean, I know what happened in the comics but this is the MCU after all, so chances are they're going to come up with a clever take on the original story. (I hope)

I have no idea if the sequel is going to be equally as good. That is, of course, what I'm ultimately rooting for but the realist in me is like ""how the heck are they going to top that?"" I have no idea.

Closing remarks: The Hulk seemed rather wimpy in this movie. I mean, it wasn't quite what I was expecting.",9

Awesome Movie Story,25 July 2023,"Avengers: Infinity War (2018) is an epic and action-packed cinematic marvel that brings together the beloved superheroes from the Marvel universe in a thrilling showdown against the formidable villain, Thanos. Directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, the film lives up to its immense hype, delivering a visually stunning and emotionally charged experience.

The movie flawlessly weaves together multiple storylines as the Avengers, Guardians of the Galaxy, and other heroes unite to prevent the evil Thanos from obtaining all the Infinity Stones, which would grant him unimaginable power. The film's pacing is relentless, keeping audiences on the edge of their seats throughout.

The performances are top-notch, with each actor bringing depth and charisma to their respective characters. Josh Brolin's portrayal of Thanos is particularly compelling, creating a villain that is both menacing and complex.

Avengers: Infinity War boasts jaw-dropping action sequences, breathtaking special effects, and moments of heart-wrenching sacrifice. It explores deeper themes of sacrifice, loss, and the consequences of wielding immense power.

The film's ending is a shocking and emotional gut punch that leaves audiences eagerly awaiting the next installment. Avengers: Infinity War is a cinematic achievement that celebrates the superhero genre and sets a new standard for epic storytelling on the big screen. Whether you're a longtime Marvel fan or a newcomer, this film is an absolute must-watch for any lover of thrilling and emotionally resonant cinema.",9

Action, action, action followed by the biggest emotional punch to the gut ever! I've never loved a film and hated it so much in my life! Love this film!!!",10
Best one yet,26 April 2018,"I don't know how they do it but they just keep getting better. They managed the bringing together of all the major characters really well. The CGI and special effects were awesome. The ending was on the edge of your seat stuff and has left me wanting the next instalment NOW!!

Bravo MCU. Bravo.",10
Epic thrills with great action and comedy throughout,27 April 2018,"The Russo brothers did a great job with The Winter Soldier and Civil War and they've outdone themselves with the 3rd and by far most ambitious and successful Avengers movie.

As my brother put it, this movie has all the best qualities of Marvel superhero movies but with few or none of the weaknesses. That's pretty accurate. There's a lot of humour in this one and it works really, really well. I laughed out loud many times, more than for many good comedies. What makes it great is that it's all character and situation based. They aren't just stupid gags or forced jokes but natural humour based on how the characters really would react to the many crazy things which happen. The Guardians of the Galaxy practically steal the show although the chemistry between many of the other characters is great as well, with a lot of funny one-liners and one-upmanship.

This focus on characters also applies to the action. Every superhero gets to show off their skills in cool, impressive ways. The integration of the airport scene from Civil War is used all the way throughout this movie. We often cut between different parts of the action, seeing the other events clearly in the background. It all comes together really well. Infinity War outdoes the solo movies for most characters, meaning Spider-man is way cooler in this than in Homecoming and the same goes for Dr. Strange and many others.

Thanos is a great villain and very intimidating. I really like Josh Brolin's performance. He's calm and confident with a clear goal in mind. And we get some insight into his motives showing that he's not purely evil. However, his justifications are stupid - I feel like he could be stopped if people just explained some basic economics to him and showed him some Thomas Sowell videos. The Malthusian trap and other similar theories about impending over-population have been common since 1798 and have never come true. Consider densely populated places like Japan and Hong Kong which have high standards of living and some sparsely populated African countries like Namibia which are dirt poor. The Nazis wanted Lebensraum but prosperity has nothing to do with living space and everything to do with free trade. But anyway...

The music is better than average for these superhero movies but NOTHING compared to the days when movie themes were actually memorable. I could recognise the Avengers theme but little else. It's completely pathetic compared to Superman (1978), Batman (1989), Spider-man (2002) and other John Williams series like Star Wars and Harry Potter. Those movies have multiple recognisable and hummable themes, often a main theme, love theme and themes for major good guys and villains. But Infinity War is great in other areas. I just reminisce about when movie music swept you away rather than being the same kind of generic mish-mash of Hans Zimmer-esque action music for every movie...

The bad guys who support Thanos were awesome. Ebony Maw was especially cool with all kinds of insane powers that he casually brings out. I liked the look of them, not really like anything I've seen before. It reminds of how the image of little green aliens is so pervasive and common in TV shows and movie. For example, Independence Day, Signs and War of the Worlds all have fairly typical alien creatures. But the grey guys in Infinity War are very cool and memorable.

The CGI is very good overall, but I still wish they'd include more real elements. It doesn't compare to Nolan's movies which are often more gripping because they are largely done for real. His movies will last a long time whereas CGI effects are destined to date rapidly.

The story is ambitious and doesn't really hold back. The stakes are high and some parts of the movie are quite heavy. I'm really excited to see where they're planning on going for the next movie. The girl next to me was on the edge-of-her-seat, often covering her mouth and gasping or swearing as various beloved characters have their lives threatened. The stakes are higher I suppose because so much time has already been invested into these characters. I had similar emotional reactions seeing battles in the 7th season of Game of Thrones, not knowing if main characters would make it out alive or not.

This is a one-of-a-kind superhero movie event. It's a great action/comedy spectacle made by the best directors of Marvel movies so far. All the characters are at their physical/comedic peak and are mostly used to full effect (with a few exceptions). I'm not surprised that Infinity War has reached #10 on the top 250. It's just too amazing in its strengths for its weaknesses to hold it back. Apart from Nolan's more serious films, this is the new standard for epic, fun superhero movies.",10
Woaaahhh!,8 May 2019,"Yes, this is a superb movie. So many characters\heroes and still managable. Thanos as villain perfect. He has reason, not just a dumb evlil nobody. Good job. I wish Endgame was that cool as this movie.",9

Fight for Infinity Stones,25 June 2022,"Avengers: Infinity War (2018) is a fantastic part 1 to the Infinity Saga finale the MCU has built up for several years.

Every single actor playing every single superhero is fantastic. Since we know these characters throughout all the movies, we can get behind all of them and tell how hard they are trying to stop the worst possible thing that can happen to all living things.

The big villain Thanos played by Josh Brolin was fantastic. The villain that has been teased throughout the MCU made a grand entrance and you can understand why he is looking for the Infinity Stones, also he is immensely powerful when going up against the Avengers.

The action scenes are awesome, the effects look great, and the way he uses the Infinity Stones is cool. The 3rd act ultimate battle is great and visually pleasing to watch.

The movie has a surprising ending that will leave MCU fans speechless. Avengers: Infinity War (2018) is an epic part 1 to the finale of the Infinity Saga.",8
Fantastic movie! (A little bit of spoilers),28 April 2018,,9
A Fun Thrill Ride That Repeats Some of Marvel's Mistakes,27 April 2018,"This is it, this is what everything has been building to since Iron Man first graced the screen in 2008. Thanos has come for the Infinity Stones, and it looks like not even the Avengers can stand in his way.

This film had a massive burden to carry: how to juggle the characters from the Avengers, the Guardians of the Galaxy, Doctor Strange, and Black Panther all in one movie without them stepping on each other's toes for their time in the spotlight. Despite all the odds, the Russo Brothers actually managed to pull this feat off, with every character actually fulfilling a useful role without feeling superfluous.

Where this film shines is in the interactions between characters who have been isolated up until now, much like the first Avengers: Iron Man and Star-Lord, Doctor Strange and Spider-Man, Thor and Groot. The chemistry between these people is what binds this film together into something that even fans of only one character can enjoy among the ensemble.

What really drives the film, though, is Thanos, the man who we have only seen glimpses of in three films up until this moment. This film really strives to frame Thanos in such a way that while you can't justify his actions, you can sympathize, or at least understand, why he does what he does. Plus, it explores the relationship that was only discussed in passing in both Guardians films, namely his status as father to Gamora and Nebula. Their dynamic is among the stronger reasons why Thanoscan be considered one of the best villains of the MCU.

Where this film falters, however, is when it repeats the mistakes previous Marvel films have made. Two films come to mind when discussing this film's issues: Avengers Age of Ultron and Thor Ragnarok.

Firstly, this film is really funny. The jokes are hysterical, especially the deep callbacks to previous films and the natural way they come about. There's nothing wrong with being funny. The problem comes in, much like it did in Thor Ragnarok, when the humor ends up coming at inopportune moments and it kills the dramatic tension. This is especially bad when characters discuss immensely serious matters, and a joke come in and lingers for so long, as if to reassure the audience ""hey, we're still having fun, right guys?""

Secondly, and perhaps most importantly, is the problem with stakes. Coming into this film, one of the big questions on everyone's minds was would one of the main characters die in this film. After all, a couple of the main actors, especially Chris Evans, have stated their run as their Marvel characters were coming to an end. And without getting into details, this is the same problem as with Age of Ultron. When the script calls for the main threat as something that will potentially destroy all of the Avengers, you know it won't happen for one basic reason: Disney wants to continue to take your money from these immensely popular films. So, they know they can't do anything too serious otherwise they risk cutting off their cash flow.

Nevertheless, despite these problems, it is worth seeing this latest Avengers film, especially for its setup of things to come. It's not the best Marvel film by a long shot, but maybe it didn't need to be.",8

The Sin of Big Movie,29 April 2018,,9
WOW! What a movie!,25 February 2019,"Avengers: Infinity War is a movie we have never seen before. Having been 10 years in the making Infinity War does not disappoint! There is so much going on in this movie that you will have to see it at least twice! The action is fantastic, the special effects are amazing, & the pacing is perfect. Just when you think ""It's been awhile since I've seen...."" they bring them right back into the action. Every Marvel film has led to this. While it does end with an amazing cliffhanger, it's going to keep us on the hook desperately waiting for Avengers 4. Acting standouts are Paul Bettany, Elizabeth Olsen, Robert Downy Jr., Tom Holland, Chadwick Boseman, & Josh Brolin. Not that anyone else wasn't good, these were just the people we saw the most. I CAN NOT WAIT till the next one!!!!",10
This was a waste of time.,5 January 2019,"The worst mcu movie I've ever seen. I really wanted to like it since it was so critically acclaimed and praised, but I think this movie is overwhelmingly overrated. I won't watch it again like I did after I watched the first avengers movie.",1
This movie was AMAZING,31 July 2018,This was the ultimate best film this Summer2018! Can't wait to buy this movie and watch it again.,10
Let's not exaggerate here,22 July 2018,"Infinity War is one of the best Marvel movies (and of the Superhero genre in general), but is not perfect. The way the Russo brothers entangled all the stories of this past ten years is pretty good, and seeing all the near 30 characters of the MCU in one movie is a really cool fan service, but let's be realistic: the movie is a complete fan service. The weight of the movie is carried by 2 groups of heroes, leaving the rest of the cast there without doing something else that doesn't add much to the plot. One would expect to see all the characters together in the same scene, but some of these never met in the whole movie and didn't even do or say something remarkable. That's the BIG flaw of this movie, but there are so many good stuff here, like the villain, Thanos, the best character in the whole movie. His motives and actions are very well justified and portrayed by Josh Brolin. He is a strong character with a strong personality, and he steals the movie. The visuals are also very good, with a minor issues in some characters, who look like videogame PNJ. The music is so intense and is an emotional homage to the original Avengers soundtrack. Anyway, Infinity War is an enjoyable movie for superhero fans, and will be arguable considered as the ""best superhero movie ever"" by some easy-to-please fans and critics, but that's just a tag far from the reality.",8
Gritty,10 May 2018,"This is not your normal Marvel movie and for good reason. My one criticism is that they spent a large portion of the film developing Thanos' character, but the Avengers (and others) seemed to not change, develope, or learn in any significant way from beginning to end. Other than that small issue, it's a well written story and finally a superhero movie that makes me want to see the next one.",10
The best super hero movie!,10 March 2019,"It was incredible this movie. The Thanos, in my opinion, the best villain ever.",10
Best MCU movie yet.,31 July 2018,"The movie that has been teased since 2012, and it does not disappoint. Enjoyable, fun, action packed, and tense.",9
10 years of wait is over in a snap,9 May 2018,Marvel has managed to give a new meaning to superhero genre with a great story and well scripted action. It felt like a dream come true looking at all the characters come together for the epic finale. The movie managed to keep me on the edge of my seat until in the end. Best SUPERHERO movie of all time.,9
Best Avenger Movie Ever!!,30 April 2018,"The best Avenger movie ever, i'm very enjoyed the movie.",10
Total disappointment,29 April 2018,"Was very very disappointed with this movie. It just did not have anything going for it. I mean there were moments that were good. But you cant just rely on a couple of big moments to carry the entire movie. There wasnt a story. There were constant loopholes (like Thor's varying powers. He cant fight Thanos but a dying star light gives him nothing but a sun tan). Most importantly the humour was not working at all. This after thor ragnarok which just was awesome in ghat department.

Overall i would say i was as disappointed with this movie as with BvS. I guess i wont be watching Avengers 4 as well.

P.S. The critics reviews of Avengers infinity war make me skeptical. They may not be paid reviews, but i guess they are scared of giving a bad review to such a huge movie.",4
Best movie,13 May 2018,,10
What an unexpected turnaround by Marvel,6 May 2018,It's the most ambitious piece of storytelling in the 10 years since its inception,10
this is a new area of Cinema Movies,3 March 2019,I can't believe how many idiots rate this film with 1 stars...unbelievable. We are not living in the 80's or 90's and I think most of this bad rates comes from people how still think that movies from 80-90's are the benchmark for good movies. This movie will show you what the future of great films are. I watched this movie about 15 times. It's one of the best movies I have ever watched. I can't get enough of this kind of movies. This is a game changer movie...one of the best of all time for me,10
Infinity War is a well crafted movie - but is it really good?,20 May 2018,,8
Very exciting,8 May 2018,This movie is the most interesting one I've ever seen.,10
Almost too good to be true.,28 April 2018,This movie is amazing. Best movie ever. There was a lot of hype for this movie and it was not over hyped at all. This was an awesome movie. It's so amazing and I can't say enough about it.,9
"no villain,only hero",28 March 2020,"Not to mention what the plot of the next movie will be, but for this avengers 3, there is no villain, only justice, no villain, only hero!",9
Cartoony and unsatisfying,30 April 2018,How does an audience connect with a giant purple cg Josh Brolin? Younger people will have no problem with it I suspect. They are part of the gaming generation/culture. For those who desire an experience that is bit more grounded. Blast off in your rocket pack. So much of this movie is cgi it becomes distracting and even corny. The script tries to weave too many characters into a straight forward story. The result is a messy flat video game movie the equivalent to children playing with their action figures at recess.,5
Unexpected,8 December 2019,,9

Greatest marvel movie of all time,28 April 2018,Astonishing movie.You will be amazed!All heroes are here to make this summer unforgettable.This is the rare summer film that exceeds ilofty expectations and delivers a crowning achievement for the Marvel Universe.The Mad Titan (Thanos)is going to face some resistenc from our heroes.But who knows whats going to happen.Maybe our heroes will fail or they may win.But its Marvel and anything can happen.Enjoy!,10
Deep and Complex!,28 April 2018,"Yes this is a POPCORN EPIC ACTION COMIC FLICK! But the Stakes are Real, We can feel the Pain of Loss and Wow!!! The Villian is Far more Complex than Anything I had Expected! This is a Must Watch for Marvel MCU Fans! Loads of Winks, Nods, Payoffs, Laughs, and WTFS!!!",10

Outstanding,3 September 2018,"Best marvel film made to date, my favourite comic film bar the dark knight. This film has everything! I was blown away.",10
My Review from the Loo,27 April 2018,"You know that feeling when you're bursting for the toilet, I mean you have the sweats you're back teeth are floating, you can feel it touching the cloth but your miles from any decent place to go so you hold it and hold it. But then you get home, race to that porcelain prize.

It sits there like a gift from the gods looking all shiny and white, clean and pristine then you proceed to bomb it like a middle eastern country. You remember that feeling of relief, joy, rapture you might have even commented to yourself it doesn't get any better than this, well that might be true until you see Infinity War, it's that good

Now where's the toilet roll????",10
Overhyped leads to Disapointment,27 April 2018,100 minutes of a glorified Guardians of the Galaxy movie followed by a too long battle scene by which i'd checked out. The ending bits were unsatisfying with an ending that just left you with no resolution. Basically 150 minutes of your life where nothing happens or is resolved.,1
Avengers Level Threat.,30 March 2021,"All the aspects of existence will remember this film as one of the best. Great character build, the story stays consistent and knows exactly what it wants to do and who to draw in. The action is chair gripping and very tense. It's rare that we see a villain act out of what they believe will be for the good of the universe. This is a movie that we knew was coming and one that no one was ready for.",9
To Infinity and beyond!,3 May 2018,"There was an idea to bring together a group of remarkable people to see if they can make the universe that nobody else would, to see if it can be more than a franchise. On that day, when Hollywood's most brilliant filmmakers came together to win box offices the way no one could. On that day, they made the MCU. All theatrics aside, this is an achievement unlike anything seen before. For ten years, we have had the pleasure of a consistently good series of films starring superheroes, many of whom were virtually unheard of or overlooked by the general public from ""Iron Man"" to ""Black Panther"". Now, the hype has reached its highest point yet when the Avengers and others must band together one more time against their greatest challenge yet, the mad titan Thanos, who seeks ultimate power by collecting the Infinity Stones, which power a Gauntlet that will allow its user total mastery of the universe.

Words may not be sufficient for what I experienced, but I'll do my best nonetheless (without spoilers of course). Seeing all the faces we've come to know and love come together, in some cases meeting for the first time, and playing off each other was beyond amazing, their chemistry practically flawless and well worth the wait. They also provide beautiful combos of skills and powers to the table with even minor characters like Nebula and Falcon having their moments to shine on the battlefield. The music perfectly accentuates many scenes from the epic to the tragic like Capt. America's first appearance and the comedy is top notch. Plot twists are at an all-time high here as there are many things that utterly shocked me to the core, one of which made my jaw drop. In fact, the drama is arguably as strong, if not stronger, than the action scenes with plenty of heart-wrenching moments and dialogue.

So, after all the buildup, how does Thanos hold up? Enough to hold up the very heavens. Josh Brolin brings an astonishing depth to a menacing villain who is almost the protagonist in this story, his backstory and motivations making complete sense when you think about it. You also empathize with what he's going through as he is not going on his campaign unscathed, physically and emotionally. He's not doing it out of a clichéd bad guy desire but out of sense of what he believes is right (different from his comic counterpart but still effective).

It's funny how these movies played out as a trilogy, not just literally but in a state of being; the 1st had the spectacle in seeing these heroes come together (body), the 2nd was more philosophical (mind), and the 3rd hits you in the heart (spirit). The film ends on an open, ambiguous note, so we'll have to wait for the 4th Avengers to complete the story. Some of you should have spare underwear and be ready to empty your tear ducts for the awesomeness and tragedy to come. The tides of the MCU have changed and we must be ready for anything.",9
Best MCU Movie,11 September 2018,,10
It was Spectacular as well as heartbreaking.. 100/10 !!!,27 April 2018,"Marvel's Avengers : Infinity war left me with mixed feeling of joy and sorrow at the same time. I left the theatre depressed and needed some alone time to mourn. Hats off to The Russo brothers for making a movie that is not only as accurate as the comicbooks but also the biggest blockbuster live-action superhero movie ever made. It was Epic, Emotional, Great Story, Eye-popping Visuals, Well-paced, Major cliffhanger, surprising moments and many more.

As for the Villain, Marvel did it again after Black Panther with a Great Story arc to set up the character of the Villain. You have to love the character as well as you will fear the character. Josh Brolin did a fantastic job with Thanos, His voice is just too perfect, just scared the heck out of me. I just made Thanos my favorite Villain no.2.

As for the story, A big cliffhanger in the end will left you in tears but don't worry ""Captain Marvel"" is coming to save us all.

I am going to cry till the next movie comes out :( :( ;_; .",10
Amazing,6 March 2019,,10
Incredible,3 May 2018,"This universe that Marvel created is so good, it is amazing what they can do with the time line to make everything work, it is my favourite movie from all time without a doubt...

Now I just have to wait until 3rd of May of 2019 to see the conclusion of this amazing world :D",10
worth the price,25 July 2018,"I lived the loki scenes, just that really. It is rich in characters, subplots and dynamics, much better than other avengers, but Loki is the best. Too bad what happens to him, in such silly way.",10
Movie without main goal,14 May 2018,"I am giving five only for the very good effects and the humor inside this movie. It looks like couple of movies inside one with all marvel heroes together. The way how everything is given does not correspond to the possibilities that this kind of movie can give, Very cheap story without any serious or physical reality that any of the heroes can give. Made just for fun without scientific background of how every single heroes can act in it.

For example Dr. Strange defeated much more powerful enemy in Dr. Strange movie and here he just playing the time shifting crystal as a toy.

Very bad story.",5
MCU masterpiece!,25 April 2019,"Even arter watching all of the other movies, this is All that you can expect and much more! Not going to Spoil it. I am just going to say great script, great acting, great cgi. An emotional rollercoaster: Impecable!!! I am sure I will Watch it a couple of Times more right after watching it five times more! All to be greatly enjoyed! Nothing could prepare you for this!!! Greetings from sda!",10
Destiny Still Arrives,27 April 2018,"Wow. Watched it five times so far, absolute spectacle. I've never been more emotionally and mentally beaten after a film - credit to the Russo's. You can read all the 10* reviews on here, so I'll keep it short. Josh Brolins' Thanos is better than Heath Ledgers' Joker. What a performance. That is how you culminate a story - what character development! Also Thor, Drax, Iron Man, Gamora, Doctor Strange and Star Lord shine here. Actually everyone is at their best! Holy sh**",10
"Excellent superhero movie, lived up to the hype, it suffered from the expected flaws but MCU fans will definitely love it anyway.",26 April 2018,,9
Spectacular,26 March 2019,Amazing movie Incretible scenes thanos is amazing but i think winter soldier is still the best marvel movie but still thank you russo brothers for this amazing movie,10
Avengers: Infinity War is a perfect movie,30 May 2021,Marvel did a good job bringing all these characters to the screen which worked perfectly. The action was fantastic. Thanos as the villain was so good. There wasn't a second that I didn't like about this movie.,10
Mind-bending! Wow! Just Wow!,26 April 2018,"Wow! Just, wow!! Marvel Cinematic Universe has been building up to this movie for ten years. This movie is glorious. All I can say is, you will not be expecting what happens. It left me screaming inside. I still cannot believe it.

The storyline is about the Avengers and their allies needing to team up to stop the titan Thanos from collecting The Infinity Stones and destroying half the universe.

Now, because all the Marvel characters are finally coming together, Marvel fans will obviously be excited. And when basically every single character appears on-screen, the theater erupts into claps and screams of joy. I always love it when a studio or company can make people feel such excitement for their characters. It's just really cool.

This movie features lots of different locations that the characters travel to. I must admit, some of these locations are absolutely gorgeous and others, totally desolate, but still incredible. I love the shots in space and on different planets, especially the snowy planet that Thanos goes to at one point. In fact, the whole movie looks fantastic. Everything - from the costumes, the camera angles, the scale, the special effects - everything! I was so invested in the visuals the entire time.

Also, let's be honest, this is Marvel, we all expect this movie to be absolutely hilarious. And it is. No surprises there. I laughed so hard at Iron Man and Doctor Strange arguing, Star Lord being jealous of Thor and basically all of Spider Man and Drax's dialogue. Comedy always seems to be Marvel's greatest strength. The writing, in general, is fantastic. I love the interactions these characters have, even the dramatic moments. That's coming from someone who usually hates dramatic moments, because I hate being sad in movies.

This is a superhero movie, so obviously there are some pretty cool action scenes. And yeah, this movie has some awesome action scenes. Probably my favorite is the huge fight in Wakanda that is shown in the trailer. The fight is absolutely massive and straight up amazing. The shots and the way the characters work together are just glorious. I felt so immersed in all the action.

Since this movie is connected to the other Marvel movies in their Cinematic Universe, there is the possible question about whether you need to have seen all the other movies in order to understand this one. I would say, not all of them, but at least a few certain ones. I recommend that you brush up on your Marvel characters before you go, just to be ready.

I give this movie 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 12 to 18, as it gets pretty dark.

Expensive crap movies only by Marvel,8 October 2018,,2
"simply, fantastic",10 June 2019,"The story was so so great , I really like it too much . the acting was magnificent , and the fighting scenes were amazing. It's really worth my time , that's why I recommend it to all.

8/10",8
The biggest crossover in film,29 June 2018,"The Russo Brothers have showed that they can go beyond the comic book movie genre and they've done it again. Despite the great moments it has, Avengers: Infinity War isn't a perfect film, as much as I would like it to be.

The action was cool; it was a big showcase of all the different fighting styles throughout the battles. The fact that there are just so many characters in this film hinders the possibility of each character really showing off their skills. For example, Captain America was shown to have new shields in the trailers so I was looking forward to seeing him use them to fight off the alien army but it barely happens. There is always time spent to show off Tony Stark's new tech though, and seeing him fight with them was fun as they are always so inventive with Iron Man's abilities.

The MCU has always had trouble with creating and defining a villain along with their motives. So many of them are forgettable and seem dull and uninspired even though they come from their own source material. Thanos is the exception though, if there is one baddie in the MCU that anyone will remember, it's clearly going to be this guy. He had a lot more screen time than I was expecting. Much of the good that comes out of the Thanos character is also brought in by Josh Brolin, giving many great performances and having a great voice for a big villain. James Spader's motion capture in Avengers: Age of Ultron wasn't bad in my eyes but the way they did it for Brolin's Thanos in this film was much better. It seemed more natural; the facial expressions never looked weird and were actually pretty clear. I almost forgot Thanos wasn't alone though, as he also had The Black Order on his side. Unfortunately these allies were somewhat forgettable; the roles they play are very sparse and I don't actually remember their names ever being said at any point in the movie. I myself only knew who they were because I had done research on them a while ago so I can only imagine how the more casual enjoyers of the MCU films felt when they saw these secondary villains pop up seemingly out of nowhere.

Like many other people, I've seen the previous MCU films so I already know the main characters. In this case I was just anticipating some fun interactions with different characters and seeing them team up. One of my favorites came from the dynamic between Tony Stark and Stephen Strange. They're similar in various ways and seeing them finally be in each other's presences was interesting to watch. It also helps that RDJ and Benedict Cucumber are great actors themselves and help make the interactions as fun and/or serious as they are. I was saddened to see how little Steve Rogers and T'challa were used in this film, since they should be a part of the Avengers's frontline. I feel like the filmmakers didn't know just how successful 'Black Panther' was going to be or else we probably would have seen him more throughout Avengers: Infinity War. Sure, Wakanda is an important setting for the film's overall story but the major characters from there just aren't used as much. Tom Holland's Spider-Man is always a joy to watch, as well as Dave Bautista's Drax with his dry humor. As we've seen from Thor: Raganarok, Chris Hemsworth is more than capable in pulling off the humorous side in Thor but I was much more pleased seeing him in battle. I'm also a big fan of Elizabeth Olsen so I was happy to see she'd pretty much lost the Sokovian accent and also just looked great in and out of costume. I also want to mention that I did not like the way the filmmakers handled Gamora in this movie.

The music in Avengers: Infinity War is interesting, and not in a good way. There's a YouTube video entitled ""The Marvel Symphonic Universe"" that details the use of orchestral scores in MCU films. The point of the video was to say that a lot of the music put in to these movies can sound so generic and very forgettable. It's not so different in this case, I probably won't be dying to listen to the film's soundtrack anytime soon. Some people have mentioned that this along with the fact that a portion of Avengers: Infinity War takes place in space makes it feel like Star Wars, in terms of being a type of space opera. This aspect can take away a bit from the overall atmosphere for those people, especially if they're are very familiar with John Williams's scores.

I'm definitely a bit partial to the MCU films, as they provided me with a lot of fun moments in the past years. However, as fun as they are, their prolific nature in the film industry can be concerning. Disney and Marvel are constantly growing in size and stature with these movies and it has no doubt had an effect on Hollywood in its attempts to create more cinematic universes and big blockbusters. The culture of making entirely original and meaningful films that don't pander to the audience's expectations is not as prevalent anymore and that is due to companies such as Disney and Marvel.

It's hard to keep expectations reasonable for a movie like this; there is a lot on the line and so much has been done to achieve this state in the MCU. For the most part, Avengers: Infinity War delivers on many things especially in producing some cheers and gasps from the audience. I've never once cried during a movie but I felt a little something happening in my tear glands during the final 10 minutes. Was the six years worth the wait? Considering everything that happened and the fact that the dust hasn't even settled yet, I'd say it was.",8
Avengers Infinity War Movie of the Century,28 April 2018,Avengers Infinity war the greatest movie ever I love it so much cant explain Russo Brothers proved that they are the elite directors of this era absolutely the best of the best i mean the action in this movie is out of this world i waited for this movie since i saw Thanos at the end of the Avengers and it totally worth the wait this movie will and mean WILL drop your jaw my heart was pumping so hard three times faster than normal and i am gonna see this movie hundred times again cant wait .,10
Not just for the fans,29 April 2018,"In my opinion this is an awesome movie, but how would it be if you hade only seen The Iron Man trilogy... My lovely girl has only seen some of the movies but she falls asleep way to fast. But she did absolutely love this movie !",10
Perfect action flick,3 May 2019,"I was blown away by this. And i wasn't even a fan of the other mcu movies, to say the least. However the pace of IW will almost literally leave you breathless for about 2.5 hrs - it's that good.

Speaking of pace, Endgame was so badly paced that i could only give it a 1/10. It was an utter disappointment and not an action movie, that me and probably million viewers around the world were expecting after IW.

Anywho, IW is by far the best action flick I've watched in years and i probably will re-watch it at least a dozen times in the years to come. 10/10.",10
Marvel-lous film,5 May 2018,"A very well made film that somehow manages to keep order within all the chaos. Given such a large cast, the Russo Brothers managed to make the film feel smoother than a ton other films in the MCU and delivers the thrills and the chills that are beyond any other in the MCU. The cliffhanger is shocking and leaves us asking for more. Well, here's to another year of waiting.",8

Not suitable for young children,3 June 2018,"The movie is full of very well developed action scenes. It catches the viewer's attention from the very first moment and makes good use of the Avengers skills. However, it's full of gore and extreme violence. In many times I found my daughter looking behind or elsewhere from the violence scenes. What was totally affecting her overall satisfaction was also the ending of the movie and the message it might holds. I wish I was warned before entering the movie about the number of extreme killings in the movie. I would have sure picked another one to watch with my child. One last aspect, the movie seems incomplete to me and I am not in favor of such type of stories.",5
This movie is not a 9.1,29 April 2018,"The fanatics are out in force. This is a really good movie. This is not a 9.1. I would expect to see the user rating for this one at upper 7 lower 8. I gave it an 8. Dont get me wrong, they did a great job of coordinating a complex story with so many different components all coming together that really should have been a mess. And as far as the movie being too long, I didnt feel that while watching it. I was surprised when I looked at the time after. I dont know that someone could watch this without being familiar with the backstory of several previous movies and enjoy it as much.",8
Outstanding,28 April 2018,"If you have enjoyed the long road leading from Iron Man to now, the pay off is real. Outstanding. The Russo Brothers have proven they are the masters at telling these stories. I can't wait til Avengers 4 and the final chapter of the Thanos saga.",9

"""AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR"" - MY REVIEW",29 April 2018,"Avengers: Infinity War, directed by Anthony and Joe Russo( who gave us the terrific Civil War and The Winter Soldier), is what we can term as a satisfying summer spectacle. This is not a film. It's an event. In a film with more than 20 superheroes, not once does one feel that any one of them are underutilized. The plot, as you all know , is about the conquest by Thanos (who is a computer generated character and given a terrific performance by Josh Brolin), to conquer all the 6 infinity stones and to wipe out half the universe. It's all up to the Avengers along with the Guardians of the Galaxy to stop his evil plans. That's all I can tell u about the plot. Because revealing too much will kill the experience. The director(s) have packed in all they can - marvelous action set pieces, humour, twists and dramatic moments etc.... Almost all the department have done their jobs neatly. Be it the stunning VFX or the exhilarating background score , the film has it all. The climax, I would like to mention, is not at all what you would expect, especially since this is a Marvel movie. Also the character deaths too will come across as a shock. Now coming to the performances, the list is going to be too long if I mention each and every actor. Everyone has done their roles perfectly and not once do you feel that a single character is given prominence. Hats off for the director(s) for undertaking a project of this magnificence. So all in all this an experience or should I say THIS IS the Marvel movie we all waited for. So go in and have a Blast. My rating- 4.5/5 Note: Do not miss the END CREDITS...",9
Amazing,5 July 2018,Just.... wow. A perfect wrap up of 10 years of Marvel and at the same time successfully opened up so many new stories and possibilities for the next 10 years.,9
"Wow, a hot mess",2 October 2018,"I'll keep it simple, I expected more and got less. All the other Avenger movies were a complete movie. They had a plot, a war, and won. This was not that. This was a part 1. And none of the ads mentioned it was a part 1. My expectations were dashed.

It was too much and much too inconsistent. Battles that should have been won were not for stupid reasons. I started to cheer and then had this WTF happened?

It's worth watching, but, well... just but...",5

It a fun movie, you're emotions will be all over the place by the end and you'll be counting down the days for the conclusion.",10
"If you hate these movies, then stop watching. Not that hard",7 May 2021,"Honestly though, at this point people can't leave marvel alone because their to good at making movies. Movies like these should show people super hero movies aren't always stupid idiot baby shows. People who say superhero movies don't count as movies believe that only realistic to real life types of movies are considered ""art"", and even if that's true why do people like matrix, lord of the ring, incredibles, alien, back to the future, the dark knight, Jurassic park, etc? Easy, because those movies are good and a lot of people like them, those and both marvel are completely unrealistic fictional things that could never happen in real life but no one cares, there still good and could be just as entertaining. Nothing wrong with movies like these (excluding all the rare weird cult type fan bases outside of the movie or stuff like that).",9

"10 years in the making, deserves 10 stars",27 April 2018,"Possibly the greatest movie i have Ever seen...yes you need to see the previous films all 18 of them, but this really is start to finish an epic film. And best part is...it's not over",10
Connection At Is Best,12 June 2021,These movies from MARVELS have their great impact in the whole world. No one knew that a journey of movies which was started in 2008 was so much loved by the audience. The connection through all the movies throughout these years are just awesome . One cannot understand what is going on if he/she missed any movies between these years.,10
Unbeliveble stupid,29 September 2018,"I was wondering who a sequel like this reaches a IMDB score of 8,6. Starting the film I had great expectations! But I really found NOTHING in this movie that is worth more than 4 stars. This is a senseless digital action trash with no story at all! It´s just a bunch of knows characters fighting the almighty bad guy ... No new Ideas, not funny, not emotional, just explosions and fist fights with some magic artefact lacking any sense. And the end of it is just -to be continued-. Even that tiny bit of story is not even told to the end. Its a shame that this move stands among great films with a rating of over 8. If you watch it please rate it properly and send it down to where it belongs!",4
This is a story about Thanos,26 April 2018,"Many complaints about lack of character development, when it seems that many have been missing the biggest development of all: Thanos.

Infinity War is a film about an antagonist, not a villain. Thanos is a tsunami - a wave of destruction with no preference or ideology - with no mercy.

Our superheroes have had their development through the 100+ hours of origins and sequels, so it's no disappointment or surprise to see the Avengers ""assemble"", and simply ""get on with it"", and after everything, we still with part II to come and conclude this epic. But for now, this is about Thanos and his story, everyone else is in the background as Josh Brolin dominates the role.",10
Oh My God.,28 April 2018,"So I refuse to give any spoilers because I'm not that type of person, but all I can say about this movie is just, wow. It had such a twisting, turning, roller coaster of a plot. This movie is very worth the hype let me tell you right now. Although this will be a VERY long year until Avengers 4.",10
They did it..they really pulled it off so amazingly,10 April 2019,"The ambition alone is astonishingly crazy and a huge risk for both Marvel and Disney to really get this done and it really pulled it off so well. Great plot, amazing acting, life like CGI, beautiful visuals, great humor and writing, and most importantly the perfect villain in any super hero movie ever made",10
Avengers: Infinity War,8 May 2023,"Avengers: Infinity War is action filled blockbuster with great pacing and a memorable ending. Stakes and strong performances make this a enjoyable experience. I'm a bit late to the party. But I've liked GoTG enough to watch both volumes and now wanting to see the third, I found out I needed to catch up on some stuff. Most notably Infinity War and Endgame.

Directing and visuals are great. CGI is fantastic. This really is a spectacle, I get it how you'd want to watch this in the theaters. Action sequences can become quite tiring in their chaos though. Sometimes it just moves around too much. It's rare though, most scenes are easy to follow. Generally though just really solid. To be expected.

Story and writing, overall the story is great and in my opinion a good way to cut the bloat. If anything the acquirement of the first infinity stone was a bit lazy. As it happend entirely offscreen. Especially coming from GotG it's jarring. We just needed one scene to show how ''presumably'' simple it was. Even though that would be Thanos's first stone therefore he wouldn't be that strong yet, he still did without a challenge which makes his power seem a bit unbalanced. Overall story is great like I said. There is one goal, combined through multiple storylines. Most of the characters had some objective. Comedy writing, to my surprise Infinity War's tone is a bit more serious than what I expected. The one liners are still there, but not to the point where I had to roll my eyes.

Music, the main theme is really effective. But in general the music felt underwhelming for some reason. It was never really present nor did it elevate some moments as much as it should've, like in Wakanda. When watching, you can't not compare it to similar scenes like LoTR. But one is much more effective than the other. The buildup is lacking here, mainly due to the lack of fear. Which has always been a sticking point in Marvel movies, genuine fear.

That said, it was well paced, the 2,5 hours did not feel long at all. I enjoyed it.",8
A true marvel,1 May 2018,Infinity war had so many expectations going into it. Almost every expectation was met when it was finished. The movie does a fantastic job juggling all of the different characters together while weaving the last 10 years of marvel together. They were able to make it emotional and intense without a dull moment. The movie has its negatives but the positives far out weigh them. For a movie of this scope and magnitude it did a great job.,9

Mind blown!!!!!,4 January 2019,"Amzing movie best of marvel Over the past decade marvel has earned itself the benefit of the doubt. The studio has consistently delivered smart, funny, brave films that both embrace and transcend their comic book origins. The 18 blocbusters movies produce since iron man first blasted of into the atmosphere in 2008 have not only reinvented superhero films as a genre.",10
"Epic and emotional, iMAX a MUST WATCH experience",1 May 2018,"NO SPOILERS - Good to read before the film

This movie is almost everything. Thanos has a great back story and you almost feel sorry for him. Action is very epic with a lot of great shots and great continuety. Also great to see all of the heroes work together. Doctor strange is a big part of that. The battle sequences make the adrenaline in your body floating out like water. At Some points it feels a bit overpacked and Some scenes are brief, but you only realise that after the film. This is a MUTCH WATCH experience especially in iMax beacaise of the enormous screen and banging sound you feel the tense in every single bone of your body.",8
The most entertaining movie I have ever seen,6 October 2018,The only comic book movie that can rival The Dark Knight,10
Marvellous!!,27 April 2018,Best Marvel movie ever made this movie is nuts the story telling and action sequences are smooth and epic truly an epic collision with thanos all characters are great in this movie everyone did so good loved it,10
Just WOW!!!!,28 April 2018,"No words can describe it. I've been waiting for this movie for ages. And it's finally here. I have never been so nervous to see a movie in my life. I was asking questions like "" Is it going to be really bad?"" Was my expectations to high? But of course, Marvel has created another masterpiece.

First off, let's talk about Josh Brolin as Thanos. He was incredible. Every look, gesture and movement was amazingly realistic due to the outstanding CGI, but Brolin did an amazing job to making the character feel sympathetic. The best Superhero villain in a superhero movie to date.

Next, the visuals. The visuals were outstanding. Gorgeous to look at. Joe and Anthony Russo must have really worked their asses of to achieve. Also we can't forget their directing. They really did kick it out of the park.

And last but not least, the action and characters. Of course this movie had to have incredible action to showcase the pure brutality of Thanos and why he wants the infinity stones. As well as that the rest of the cast were amazing as usual. Robert was his usual acting just a tint better and another one of my favourites was Chris as Thor throughout the movie. We can't forget about Cap either. And that ending! For the ending alone I would recommend seeing it.

It's worth the hype and a thousand times over. Avengers 4, here we come!",8
A film series which is leading up to it's final ENDGAME!,9 January 2019,"Welcome to the film that all Mavel fans on Earth have been waiting for over the last 10 years. Well, at least since the 1st Iron Man film came out in 2008. The film begins right after where our most recent Marvel films left off. For the best enjoyment of this film, I strongly recommend you are up to date on your Marvel movies and have seen both Thor: Ragnorok & Black Panther.

It's truly incredible to see every character (well, just about all of them) we've seen so far from the Marvel universe all smashed into one film as they discover a new enemy, Thanos. I was also impressed to see the return of some of the minor characters as well as the big leads. Our heroes this time are somewhat shuffled around and are forced to work with different groupings than normal, which only grew my curiosity as the film progressed. The director has done a great job at ""pairing"" characters to ensure the right tone and comedy is delivered during the film's duration. Without spoilers, some Avengers will make choice or react in a way that felt, well... somewhat out of character. Sure, it could be due to the situation they are in, but I couldn't help but keep feeling like it was slightly out of place. This may have something to do with the script, or perhaps some direction given from the director, not the actors.

The action and visual aspects are stunning as the Marvel world and story continues on. Our new villain, ""Thanos"", is heavily focused on and the CGI work on him helps create a deep and fear-inspiring character. Overall, he alone is impressive for a villain. For this film, you will continually feel that the Stakes are high and no Avenger is safe in this movie, in particular when Thanos is present with them on screen. Like all Marvel films, there is always time to laugh and applaud the action scenes, but you will also be shocked at certain outcomes for some characters.

Overall, for a film we have all been waiting for so long (only 10 years lol), Avengers Infinity War is the biggest super hero film ever made. The film has done an outstanding job of controlling all the characters but also shaking things up to make the film still fresh and fun. I enjoyed the new villain and was very impressed by some of the CGI work here. You know the rule- stay for the credits...

JUST WOOW!!!!!!!,4 November 2018,"Mind blowing!

No words to talk about this movie Every second is entertain for me. I sit on the seat like dummie NO MOVEMENT. Marvel now adding some fun in movies i like that. Now just wating for avengers 4",10
It all comes down to this,20 May 2018,"Avengers Infinity War, the film Marvel fans have all been waiting for since the first Avengers film came out in 2012, has finally arrived and it is safe to say it has lived up to the hype from the last few years. The Avengers, Earth's mightiest heroes, have returned this time teaming up with the Guardians of the Galaxy, Dr. Strange, Spider-Man, Black Panther and overall the largest ensemble of superhero characters the world has ever seen on film to defeat the deadly Thanos. The film is large in everything, scale, cast, visual effects, action, just about all one expects to see and as it progresses, it doesn't shy away from reminding audience viewers how large it is. The film's time length was necessary to establish it's story and it's characters correctly. That said not every one is a fan of films that pass 2 hours for issues concerning the story dragging on too much and too many characters to explore with not many receiving proper care. The Lord of the Rings trilogy is the best example of films that reach the 3 hour length of time that is necessary to explore all plot lines. That trilogy worked out for many audience viewers though many that try and replicate this formula rarely succeed to accomplish what Lord of the Rings did. Avengers Infinity War is 2 hours and 40 minutes long and for the most part it succeeded in what it set out to do while many may say differently, especially those who aren't the biggest fans of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Disney has never been more the extravagantly triumphant corporation that it is today with all the brands and licenses they have the rights too and because Infinity War has turned a grand profit, earning an estimated $640.9 million at the worldwide box office it's opening weekend, the latter proves itself true.

This film is mainly about Thanos. For a movie based on the heroes the Avengers, it's really his film as it explores his character in deep more than the others. Some have complained that Thanos should have been developed little by little in past MCU films before this one, however Thanos doesn't disappoint. This is probably the film's strongest point. He makes Ultron and Loki look like preschool for the Avengers to face. The best thing about Thanos is what a complex villain he is. He's more than a world conquering doomsday villain. His character is incredibly complex to the point where you can't decide whether or not you hate him or love him. The visuals for him as well as his acting portrayal are phenomenal, the same cannot be said for many villain characters portrayed through the use of CGI/motion capture. Possibly the most interesting villain character aside from Loki, he is also undoubtedly the most powerful adversary any of the Avengers have faced, proving too great of a challenge for all put together. The entire cast were amazing to see all together for the very first time, even though some got more time on screen than others do. Particular highlights include Robert Downey Jr. as he continues to develop Tony Stark's character in his darker side, having been tormented since the first Avengers film happened all leading up to him facing his greatest fear. Zoe Saldana excels portraying Gamora's suffering from Thanos that has left her damaged all her life, a side to her that has never been seen before. Benedict Cumberbatch as Dr. Strange brought a powerful, stoic presence among the film's cast. He shares great scenes with Robert Downey Jr. and they are shown to have great on screen chemistry. The rest of the characters served their purposes uniquely in the film as well. Some provide more humor than others and some get more screen time, others get less. A film with this many characters can prove to be difficult with giving each their due screen time.

The last thing to point out about Infinity War apart from the acting and visuals are the action sequences. Probably some of the best we've seen throughout the franchise. The entire film is leading to one big inevitable war that does not disappoint. Every action sequence in the film from start to finish serves as a teaser for the upcoming battle that will determine the Universe's fate. Excitement and terror are the feelings you get when you're watching the fights as you're wondering what will happen and who will die. It is true that there are tragedies throughout; that said, people in the past have complained about Marvel continuing the habit of convincing the audience that characters die only to bring them back to life. Despite the fact that many of these actors have contracts with Marvel, some for up to five to six years, it is a truly bad habit the MCU needs to halt immediately. Yes tragic deaths of beloved characters may be tragic but sometimes characters who die need to stay dead to produce emotion. Be that as it may, Part 2 of Infinity War is set to be released May 3rd of 2019. It may be a long while though Ant-Man and the Wasp is set to come out this summer, Venom is set for the Fall so we'll have plenty of distractions from the anticipation. To conclude Avengers Infinity War is a spectacle on film that fans of the franchise up to this point will not be disappointed, including non-fans who can also enjoy the film. It will leave you itching for more.",9
Awesome!,13 May 2018,"If you know and love the MCU movies, this is the greatest 10 year anniversary gift you will ever get. This is the ultimate reward for you time and attention over the last decade. Bravo, Marvel Studios, Bravo!",10
Perfection!,16 March 2019,Rarely have I watched a sequel film that fully lived up to the hype. This one did for me from the opening minute through the credit scenes.,10
"Great, but.....",17 April 2019,"Avengers Infinity Wars is an excellent movie. Very well done in every way. I saw this in the theaters, and the one complaint I have is that it was hard to watch. In the opening scene, we see the ever powerful Thanos trying to get the Space Stone, while the Hulk, Thor and Loki try to stop him. They can't and so he retrieves the stone and begins his quest for the rest of the Infinity Stones. What follows it seems, is the Avengers pulling out all of the stops, trying to defeat Thanos and fighting a losing battle. Very cool, but hard to watch. Not sure, if I'll see it again. If by chance, you're one of the few people who haven't seen it, I won't give away the ending. The good news is that Captain Marvel has joined the Avengers. I'll have to see Endgame!",9
Just amazing,26 April 2018,The epic movie we have been waiting for.Stay till the end,10
Thanos: The Movie,30 April 2018,"I am utterly speechless and this doesn't happen often, seldom even.

Josh Brolin owns as Thanos and he dethrones Killmonger as the best villain in MCU. His dialogue and motivations are masterclass writing.

The stakes have never been higher and there are scenes, that will send chills down your spine throughout the movie. There are so many sub plots, that it's hard to keep track of what's everyone doing, nevertheless the Russo brothers succeeded in that. No shaky cam, breathtaking action, amazing CGI - Beautiful viewing experience. This isn't a movie, it's an experience that will leave you wondering about the sequel.",10

"Terrible Ending, so damn confused",22 September 2018,"While this movie was terrific with tons of special effects and battle scenes, the jumping from planet to planet to magic places to past and present was very confusing... The cgi and battles were awesome, but the acting was so so and cliche. The worst was the horrible confusing ending which made absolutely no sense.. My wife and I both yelled WTF when the credits started, because the movie was surely NOT over... So lame of an ending.. I still do not know what happened... Very disappointed in this one compared to the other ones.",4
It's very good,27 April 2018,"Get ready for an emotional roller coaster though. It'll make you laugh. It'll make you cry.

It's an incredible movie",10
Thoroughly Entertaining !!,19 May 2018,"A true Avengers sequel and a must watch for Avengers fans or infact, a fan of any of the other superheroes - Thor / Captain America / Panther / Guardians / Hulk / Iron Man ..

GOOD TIMES",9
A Marvel Masterpiece - the epitome of good movie making!,29 June 2018,"After having watched this movie thrice - a rare feat that I've never done in recent years - I felt compelled to add this review, especially after I was equally compelled to review Black Panther for the huge disappointment that it was. To compare both movies would be an atrocity, so I wont even start.

Infinity War just proved how important a Directors role is, in piecing a complex storyline into one coherent masterstroke of movie making - any lesser Director would have failed miserably. The sheer scope of the script, compounded by the greatest ensemble of characters ever assembled made it a herculan task , which was effortlessly handled by the Russo Brothers. The most important thing working for it was the humor, which flows through the storyline effortlessly, and never forced. Reminded me of how hard I was laughing through ""Thor : Ragnarok"" and how much I liked it for it quirky humor. If you happen to be one of those few who havent watched it yet - please do now!",10

The Russo Brothers made an awsome job giving each character a very important participation in the film and all the story interlace extremelly well between one shot and another.

I was expecting less but this movie really impressed me and I am eager to see it again.

I have never seen and enemy (Thanos) with so logical arguments that sometimes you want to be on his side instead of Avengers. That was impacting.",10

Fun and entertaining a great 10 year built up,21 November 2018,Seeing all these characters interacting with each other on the big screen was such an amazing experience. I grew up with these characters and they hold q special place in my heart. This film isn't perfect but it's very entertaining. Not to mention this is the first time since Loki i felt that marvel fleshed out and have a real sorry to their villain.,8
WATCH ALL THE MARVEL MOVIES BEFORE SEEING THIS,27 April 2018,"This movie outdoes all expectations. It perfectly gives you all the different feels of the marvel cinematic universe within one movie. Balances humor, action, drama, suspense, and wonderfully adds surprise as well. To fully understand and experience the 10/10 rating I give it, you MUST watch all the movies. This will help you understand what led up to this, and have the feeling towards each character within the movie. Simply one of the best movies this generation will see.",10
"Movie is good, bold decision is great!",2 May 2018,"This is a surprisingly bold and unexpected movie disguised as a summer blockbuster. Excellent choices by Marvel. Just know that you really must see all, or at least most, of the previous Marvel movies to get the full impact of this.",8
"Best, most action filled, funniest Marvel movie so far.",26 April 2018,"I had great expectations for this movie, and it delivered plus more. Its 2.5 hour with action, humor, interesting dialog and all your favorite marvel characters. Ok, some very few are missing, but all the big ""players"" are involved. By far the best superhero movie of all time. Delivers on so many levels. The new thing about Marvel movies is that they have put in a lot of humor in it. Like the last Thor movie and Guardians movies. Avangers IW are kind of like that but the punchlines makes you crack out laughing. Feel like this is a mix of everything that is good about all the individual films.

2.5 hour was not enough. I want more.",10
Marvel just grew a pair,30 April 2018,"Though this is very much an Avengers movie, it feels like it could easily belomg to Thanos'. I always watched Marvel Movies in the same childlike glee I once had at a younger age, excited for the action and comedy but never really overly afraid or anxious of the outcome. More often than not, super hero movies end the way you expect them to, not much trepidation is required, and with Marvel's formula of mirroring what makes a villain I just couldn't ever feel the edge of my seat. This movie however, blew all that out the water. Not not only did they manage to create a monster I can sympathise with and at times agree with, they conjured up the perfect anti-hero. This is the film where Marvel put on it's big boy pants and, as a self proclaimed DC lover, it beats every super hero movie out there. In one word, shocking. Just...shocking.",10
THIS MOVIE IS AMAZING,7 July 2018,I personally love this movie because IT IS AMAZING,10
Half a movie... very one sided and depressing,6 March 2019,,1
Best yet!,26 April 2018,I wasn't quite sure at first with them all in the same movie but they really managed to pull it off and it's probably the best Avengers movie I've seen yet and can't wait for 2019 for part two to be realeased as it was heart wrenching for me at the end and was left on a cliffhanger. But would definitely recommend to go and see it and would of quite happy re-wanted the film moments after it ended!!,10
Dark and intense story. Loved it!,10 May 2018,,9
Worth Watching,28 May 2018,"It's not as good as Thor: Ragnarok or Captain America: Civil War, but it's better than the last Avengers film.

Probably the best of Marvels movies (so far!),15 December 2018,"Im not an avid Marvel movie watcher but Ive casually watched them on tv or dvd over the years, but this one topped the lot! Very impressive set pieces and banter between characters. And what an ending!!

There seems to be a lot of negative user reviews for some reason but maybe its because you need to have seen most of the previous ones and they dont know what the hells going on!

I knocked a couple stars off due to the poor animation of the henchmen of Thanos, particularly the female one, her face looked like a ps3 character!

Im getting this on blu for sure :)",9
"Rivals ""X-Men Last Stand"" for worst superhero movie ever.",9 September 2018,"Let's start with the Zero of the movie; Thanos, AKA, Bane-with-no-brain, AKA, the son of Brutus from the Popeye cartoons. This guy's dream is to kill half of all the sentient beings in the Universe so there are enough resources to go around for everyone left; so he's basically the Joker on stupid pills. First of all, that idea is copied from a more intelligent version of a similar concept from ""Watchmen."" Second, are we really supposed to believe that Thanos is so dumb that he does not notice when populations of living things are cut back, that they grow back stronger, thicker and more robust? So what is he going to do; wipe out half the universe every 100 years as populations grow back? The stupidity of this concept is staggering. But it's really nothing compared to the banality of the character itself. Thanos is a guy who shows up magically in every scene with the same smug grin on his face then struts around goes; ""Ha Ha Ha, I'm too strong for you, weaklings, look at my giant arms and manly rock-like chin."" He's like the villain of some 1950's cartoon and he is more one-dimensional than Paper Mario. But it gets better, he is invincible, seems to know everything, and has some way to get around every superhero's powers. He's like a character written by a little kid; completely infallible and totally, unbelievably boring.

And then there are the ""Infinity Stones."" So these totally unexplainably super-mega powerful stones have been floating around pawn shops across the universe for billions of years and no one ever thought to get them all together before Thanos? Wow, I guess he is a genius. Seems like the history of that universe would really just be a long line of big-chin jerks like Thanos who got all the stones together and used the godlike power to bully everyone else around. Of course Thanos is the first person to ever think of building giant Michael Jackson style glove for one hand to be able to hold all the stones. I guess that's what makes him such a revolution. These stones could have been developed into something meaningful, but this movie basically wastes them as the 'stamp collection of the Gods.""

Fortunately there are also Superheros. Well, not really. Essentially none of them have any relevant powers or cleverness in this movie and they never do anything that makes any difference. In fact, they are pretty much interchangeable. Mostly they just all fight the henchmen of Thanos, who are inexplicably unbeatable and even more boring and bland than Thanos. The most unforgivable misuse of a character is Rocket, who barely has any lines and almost none of them are remotely funny.

Lastly, there is the blah ending that is so unbelievably ridiculous that they are going to have to spend the next 6 movies dancing around it like the X-Men series had to do with ""Last Stand."" Actually, it's not really an ending at all, the movie just completely gives up on making any sense and in the last 15 minutes gives away all credibility. The final scenes are like an epiphany of disappointment, where you realize that the whole movie has just been leading up to the realization that the folks who made this are just incompetent and have no business making movies. Another perfect example of a franchise created by someone with vision being turned over to a crew of accountants. I would say this movie is a complete dog, but I like dogs.",1
Avengers: Infinity War - Review,3 May 2018,,10
Amazingly excellent.,1 May 2018,"I've never been a big fan of the Marvel movies. I've done extensive research on them and read many of the comics, but I haven't been into them as much as, let's say, Star Wars or other movies you may feel fit the same type of scale as these movies do.

With that said, DAMN! What a ride this movie was, from start to finish. It did have its ""lol"" points, but I feel that's expected from a ""non-James Gunn"" directed MCU movie. It's small and spread out. Lol, moments were very far and in-between and rarely stood out and always felt as if they were advancing the story in the best possible way.

That was my only problem with this movie. I found the lack of a traditional structure and character development not to hinder the film as other critics have, but instead to enhance it. I'm glad Disney let the Russo brothers do their thing and make a gorgeously directed Marvel film with no limits, especially for a movie as important as this, AND after receiving all the same backlash from the Star Wars fans for The Last Jedi.

Comparing this movie to The Last Jedi is a pretty fair match. They both are made by Disney, have gorgeous cinematography, and BOTH have great directors trying to bend expectations. The difference is with The Last Jedi, you've seemed to feel stupid and belittled, while Infinity War pats you on the back and shows you one last time who these characters are and whose ass they're going to kick. Infinity Wars ending was a triumphant and bold idea that I feel couldn't have been done any better.

Every single section scene and part of the dialogue was exceptionally well done. The shocker ending makes you think are they going to do that? Along with one of the best scores in a Marvel movie, combine to create an excellent film with possibly the best Marvel villain ever put on the big screen.

The ending, I feel, is perfect. It's something that takes you for a loop and leaves you heart-struck. The thing that ruins it for me is the knowledge that it will be undone with the next Avengers movie, Spider-Man Homecoming 2, Ant-Man and the Wasp, and Guardians of the Galaxy 3. It would be better to see the movie series end off here because anything else added to this intricate and complex storyline will make anything else feel like a bloated unnecessary epilogue to the movie, making it feel like the stakes were for nothing. As it stands now, though, no matter what happens to the MCU, this will always feel to me like the perfect send-off.

Let the Avengers assemble.",9
LOVED IT!,2 May 2018,"Great film that I throughly enjoyed throughout with great action scenes, CGI and even great jokes. But what I loved most of all was Thanos and that he really had character and actual emotion and I could really see the story from his point of view unlike most other villains in films theses days that are just megalomaniacs or blood thirsty antagonists.",9

The Best And Most Emotional Marvel Film,27 April 2018,,10
A prophet,25 May 2018,"That's a lot of action, but good action, never too boring. I felt strange, unease about this movie, because unlike my expectations the story and some images remained in my memory long after having watched it. That is a total different dimension compared to the 2 previous movies: I could not watch them completely stopping after 30 minutes. These 2 remains in the shallow waters, the deepest philosophy is about why Iron Man has lost his mask... I started to analyse why this third one is different, and basically this is simply because it bring me back in my youth, Moses, the story of prophets that have changed the face of the world, and ancient greek stories, and realised that the big picture of this movie is nothing different... As the bible is not my preferred book, this film is deeply rooted in my feelings and despite it is not my preferred movie of all times, it is definitively a great one.",8

Great Job MCU!,28 May 2018,Is a challenge to put together all those characters. MCU did a good job! I have seen some bad reviews here and I totally disagree. If you do not like superheroes and did not watch and follow MCU this movie can be really confused and a bit overrated. I strong recommend you to watch all MCU movies so you will have a great time.,8
You'll need to see it again,27 April 2018,"I saw avengers infinity war last night and I had to pick my jaw off the floor. While this movie is huge and filled with some amazing hereos it should actually be named Thanos: infinity war. While it mainly follows thanos on his journey we see just how powerful, and intimidating he is. The Russo brothers had high expectations for this movie and they delivered. This movie is too big to just see once, good thing I'm seeing it again tonight!",10
My favorite Marvel movie,27 June 2019,I greatly enjoyed this Marvel film. Might be my favorite super hero flick.,10
So much fun,23 January 2019,,8
Takes our emotions to infinity and beyond,28 April 2018,"Avengers: Infinity War-the Marvel super-creation carrying the gargantuan expectations of millions of die-hard fans and the buildup of 18 great films before it has finally been delivered to us and all I can say is that it is the best 10th anniversary gift, anyone could ever have wanted. An all-powerful villain, a lineup of all our favorite characters (barring two important ones) and the magic of Marvel make for an invigorating tale of classic good vs. evil where our heroes try to stop a galactic warlord on a murderous agenda to wipe out half the population of the universe by collecting all six infinity stones.

The opening is quite grim and the scenes, just from the first five minutes (which directly tie in with Thor:Ragnarok), establish exactly how intimidating, catastrophic and mighty our villain- Thanos is. This also pretty much prognosticates the tone of the rest of the film. Watching Infinity War is like cheering for your beloved team at a highly unpredictable and exciting game of theirs where one moment you're hooting away at the top of your lungs and in the other, you're seeing them going through a low. Yet through all the madness and chaos the film somehow finds stability. It is thrilling to witness the grand entries of the heroes you grew up with and them tossing the bad guys in the air but it is equally so, no matter how heartbreaking as well, to see them fight to the nail, stare hopelessness in the face and still put on a courageous smile and battle on and truly reach their breaking points, for that is what brings out the humanness of them all. Their inability to ignore the guidance of their moral compasses and turn stone-cold like Thanos is one of the big differences that stand out and while it may have seemingly made things tougher for them, is in my belief, that which will hand them victory too.

From edge-of-the-seat anxiety-inducing to hilarious to devastating, this film will take you through a large part of the spectrum of human emotions and yet not once does it tip off balance. The humor is tastefully placed and while admittedly the impact of certain scenes could have been heightened, such small flaws can easily be forgiven just by looking at the artfulness by which the Russo brothers have been able to include so many different characters in such an eventful and complex plot without missing to hold the unwavering attention of the viewers and maintain their heart rates at a constant mark quite surely, slightly above the normal. Apart from this, the different parallel story arcs, too, run meaningfully side-by-side and converge in a finale of epic proportions although the ultimate one is only going to come a whole year later.

Thanos, is given an extra layer of character such that even a being like him, so cruel and madly obsessed with death is shown to have a part of him that knows what love is and that punishes his heart with regret which is something that just enrichens the quality of the slight amount of character development that this film had to do. Also, despite his clearly fearsome personality, the Avengers come infuriatingly close to defeating him at instances and this goes to show that there is still reason to keep hope alive as even Thanos is not invincible. The film's main intention, however, was to tease the overgrown ardor and sentiments attached to every single superhero that appeared and give it all an intensity like never before and it has most definitely done that.

The execution of the action scenes with all their zest and visual flair will leave you awestruck for sure, although in a couple of them the CGI came out a bit tacky. I would recommend watching this movie within the first few days of its release when all the theatres are packed because the environment created by so many people who all love the same thing will take the movie-watching experience to a different state altogether.

A glorious feat and achievement and yet another feather in the cap, Infinity war will make you laugh passionately and cry just as much and may even leave you disoriented due to its shocking and brave ending. Do stick around for the post-credits scene though as it sets up what's about to come and will leave you desperately hungry for more.",10
Dumbest movie I've seen in a while,30 April 2019,Too dumb for words. I don't buy Andy Dwyer as anything close to a badass. And a tween Spiderman? Explains a lot about the people who rate this high.,3
Mega-Wow-Epic-Opus,27 April 2018,"What can I say good that has not already been said by a few people on here. The Russo Brothers from CleveLAND Ohio have created a movie I could watch 20 times and never get bored of. Well Done Joe and Anthony. Am so looking forward to 1 year from now when that untitled movie rolls along. Keep on making great pictures like this, thank you for this Mega-Epic story with all the elements mixed in.",10
Best Movie in the MCU franchise,3 May 2018,Good build from start to the end.Still leaving a plenty of questions where we all can find out in the upcoming Avengers movie.So everyone is excited to watch it as it is going to be the biggest movie in the series. Even the movie contains big actions the movie entertained all of us with the usual humorous scenes making the movie watchable without any hesitation for all kind of fans and that is one of the main reasons for the success of the entire movie universe(according to me).All in all this mark as one of the best movies I ever watched.Well flowed from beginning to the end.,9
If you've followed it up to this point you are going to have a ball,20 May 2018,,8
(8.5/10) An unrelenting ambitious spectacle.,29 April 2018,"Avengers: Infinity War is an unrelenting thrill ride of action-packed spectacle. Thanos is easily the best antagonist of the MCU, with genuine moral depth and intimidation (Ebony Maw is also a stand-out). Many characters shine brightly in this film, while others are wasted or used poorly (at least in the theatrical cut). The screenplay has a few problems with exposition, logic and a few tonal shifts. Alan Silvestri's score is incredible, the 2.5 hour running time felt shockingly quick to my pleasant surprise, and the ending is powerfully impactful. Avengers: Infinity War is nevertheless an overwhelming and ambitious blockbuster extravaganza that is the beginning of an even greater culmination for the MCU.",8
The beginning feels Gigantic but ...,7 November 2023,"Thanos isn't very good at hiding, is he ? Which is where the script falls apart. Thanos needs to be a guy clever enough to fight Earth XXL's mightiest heroes. And the Guardians of the galaxy simply spot him. Worse, Thanos is stupid enough to visit earth itself. Appointing champions who do the fighting isn't a new concept. Battling Thor & his crew at the beginning feels more than cool because it makes sense: Thor's rescue ship stands no chance. Plus, squashing a crew that just lost another battle (see Thor Ragnarok) is anything but a trope. Very cool. The script falls apart when the Avengers XXL actually find Thanos. I think this issue would have been more obvious, had Thanos failed (sorry, spoiler).",8
The best of MCU,2 April 2021,"This is the best film of the marvel cinematic universe. It has all things that a nice film shood have. The actors are fantastic, the cgi really cool and the storyline really interesting.

I suggest to watch this movie only after see the previous movies of mcu to appreciate to the fullest the story.",10
one of the best movies of all times.,28 April 2018,"This is one of the best movies of all times, wow CGI, funny, unpredictable story yet believeable.

it's like i remember the first time when i watched Avengers 1 but even more better.

bravo to Russo brother, it did live up to the hype.",10
Daring .....but boring,25 April 2018,"If you are someone who likes watching fireworks shows this special-effects saturated epic might be your cup of tea. But I had to constantly resist the urge to check my phone messages. I have to say the ending was unexpected and Marvel deserves plaudits for switching things around. The rest, unfortunately, was a pretty standard superhero movie.",3
The ending of an Era,29 April 2018,"Thanos has arrived after Ten Years of waiting! No matter if you hate Marvel Movies or not, this is the movie you've been waiting for the last ten years. This is the 10th year anniversary of the MCU and the end of an era for Marvel Films. Of course there will be more movies, but there will be different in a better way. I have to say that this Movie is only for Marvel fans, if your not one and haven't watched the last couples of Films, then you'll probably don't know what is happening. For enjoy this the most you need to watch at least Thor Ragnarok, Civil War and the previous Avengers.

I don't consider myself a hardcore Marvel fan, although I enjoy most of the Movies (excluding of course Thor 1,2, Captain America 1 and Iron Man 2, I truly hate those Movies) and get excited with every Stan Lee cameo.

I think that this is another fun Marvel Movie that every MCU fan will enjoy, laugh and cry. The thing is that I don't thing this deserve a 9.1 or even a 8. THIS IS NOT THE BEST COMIC BOOK MOVIE!

Overall a great film with great characters (although some not so much) an amazing villain and big surprises. This is indeed the film of the summer we've all waiting for!",8
I agree with blparker's review,28 April 2018,The movie is amazing from start to finish..the only thing I would like to have seen more of is longer fight scene when Thor arrives on the battlefield. Wish it showed a longer amount fight scene and not gone to somewhere else..Was my only complaint but other than that..Best Avengers movie and super hero movie of all time period.,10
A film like no other.,26 April 2018,"What can i say about infinity wars that hasn't been said before. It's the first part of the epic conclusion to the previous 10 years of story telling. It features attention to detail like no other film, with plot points that have been worked on over the course of those 10 years. The only thing i can say honestly is that it completely changes the face of superhero films, it draws you in, leaves you saddened, excited, scared and on the verge of tears, but yet we still want more, it leaves you hanging on the edge throughout the film, until the stunning and heart wrenching conclusion leaves you hungry for more. bravo Russo brothers, you've created a masterpiece.",10
A Superhero Masterpiece Beyond Imagination,19 July 2023,"In the realm of superhero films, ""Avengers: Infinity War"" stands tall as a monumental achievement that has redefined the very essence of what it means to be a blockbuster.

Brace yourselves, dear readers, for I am about to present to you the greatest superhero movie ever to grace the silver screen.

From the very first frame, ""Avengers: Infinity War"" plunges the audience into a mesmerizing whirlwind of emotions, action, and sheer cinematic brilliance. The film unapologetically embraces its epic scope, weaving together a tapestry of intricate storylines, larger-than-life characters, and jaw-dropping visuals that leave you gasping for breath.

At the heart of this unparalleled cinematic spectacle lies the villainous Thanos, portrayed with captivating depth by Josh Brolin. Marvel Studios has achieved what few thought possible-an antagonist whose motivations transcend the typical tropes of evil. Thanos is a character burdened by the weight of his own twisted logic, and Brolin's remarkable performance gives him a hauntingly human quality that lingers long after the credits roll.

The Russo brothers, directors of ""Avengers: Infinity War,"" have proven themselves to be true maestros of the superhero genre. They orchestrate the film with an awe-inspiring finesse, deftly balancing a sprawling ensemble cast while never losing sight of the emotional core that grounds this fantastical tale. Each character, be it the iconic Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), the noble Captain America (Chris Evans), or the enigmatic Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen), is given their moment to shine, showcasing the filmmakers' unwavering commitment to character-driven storytelling.

But it is in the audacious narrative structure of ""Avengers: Infinity War"" that its true brilliance lies. Marvel Studios has the audacity to defy expectations, to subvert the formulaic boundaries of superhero storytelling, and to create a film that fearlessly challenges its audience. The relentless pacing keeps you on the edge of your seat, hurtling towards an earth-shattering climax that leaves no heart untouched.

Beyond the visual splendor and the incredible performances, ""Avengers: Infinity War"" delves into profound philosophical questions that resonate on a deeply human level. It explores themes of sacrifice, the consequences of power, and the fragile nature of hope. In this grand tapestry of heroes and villains, Marvel Studios crafts a reflection of our own society, forcing us to confront our own frailties and the choices that define us.

In every aspect of its production, ""Avengers: Infinity War"" surpasses expectations. The exceptional visual effects create a stunningly immersive world, while the evocative musical score by Alan Silvestri sets the perfect tone for this cosmic odyssey. The meticulous craftsmanship evident in every frame elevates this film to a level of artistry seldom seen in blockbuster entertainment.

Dear reader, I implore you to experience ""Avengers: Infinity War"" for yourself. It is a film that transcends the boundaries of its genre, captivating both the ardent comic book fans and the casual moviegoers.

In the pantheon of superhero movies, ""Avengers: Infinity War"" ascends to the pinnacle, heralding a new era of cinematic storytelling. This is not merely a film; it is an experience of unprecedented magnitude. Prepare to be enthralled, enraptured, and forever changed.",10
Avengers Infinity War: The Ultimate Goal(Spoilers),10 April 2019,,8
Worth waiting,6 May 2018,No doubt I'll score this blockbuster a 9. The intensive fightings have a good rhythm and a logic without big bug. Thanos attacks each battlefield one by one and give you a good impression how it happens till the end-- though kind of vague in it. But it is exactly what the directors want-- wait for the next one!,9

The Hype Is More Than Expected,28 April 2018,,10
A Marvel Cinematic Experience that unites all its multitude of characters,17 May 2018,,8
The end of a Marvel phase is coming,20 May 2018,"To start, I found the film to be entertaining. I personally don't go into super hero movies looking for something utterly profound or with a snob mentality. I take it for what it is. Marvel has set up its universe as one the whole family can watch and as such comes a level of predictably at times. Infinity War is another chapter in a long living super hero genre that follows a certain criteria, and that's what I expected going in.

Other reviews trekked mud all over the movie saying it had no character development, it is too long, it is not long enough, there was no story/plot, they expected more, they didn't get the hype. The funny thing is while they cringed at whoever rated the film as a 9 or 10, they equally pulled a crazy and rated it a dead 1 out of 10. A drastic 1 rating means this film is completely unwatchable, which I didn't find to be the case at all.

Yes, I agree there could have been more done to the film to really polish it, but overall I enjoyed it. It is exactly a Marvel film. Going in hoping for a Sundance, super dark, drastic change in style isn't going to happen. To expect more would be pure insanity because for Marvel, the formula works. Is it going to peeve some comic book nerds and those with their nose held to the ceiling in hyped-up high expectations? Oh yeah.

I have watched every Marvel film up to this culmative point so this brings me to the major point: you have to go in having seen the prior films. It all leads to this movie ten years in the making. It is ten years of character development, ten years of story and plot, ten years of Thanos--and Marvel--building up for this endgame moment where life is not always fair. In Infinity War, the 10-year-movie-in-making finally hits it's climax so it really isn't a shocker when there is nothing but fighting and a fast-paced direction as it all comes crumbling down. There is no more waiting, no more time for long chit-chat banter or backstory and introductions of who is who and why. It's Thanos. He's here. It's all about him now and how to stop him.

Knowing this, watch the film with an open mind, for the sake of entertainment. Also, look at it as a final, much longer end credit scene before the next Avengers because it will leave you greedily wanting the next installment.

(Side note: there is an added plus if you have seen all 18 previous films during its time because unfortunately, some films have become dated in style.)",8
A surprisingly powerful experience,6 May 2018,"Unlike many others, I didn't anxiously await the release of the movie, I wasn't even hyped. However, after the rather high scoring user reviews came in I got curious, as none of the previous movies were nearly this high rated. So I gave it a shot and boy was it worth it. The large cast of characters fit in surprisingly well, though not every character gets the same amount of attention (which is understandable). The action is stunning from a visual perspective and feels quite tight (as it should be). The humor is mostly spot on, probably my favorite of any MCU movie, without undermining the seriousness at all. However, the part which got me really invested is the story and the villain. Thanos has to be one of my favorite super hero movie villains and definitely my favorite one in the MCU. I don't want to spoil anything, so all I will say is that I left the movie with rather strong feelings, certainly more than any super hero movie has ever invoked in me. I would highly recommend watching the previous two Avengers movies and maybe Captain America: Civil War, Guardians of the Galaxy 2 and Thor: Ragnarok in advance to get to know the characters and setting of the MCU at the time the movie takes place in but it is still enjoyable without limited or none previous knowledge. I am certainly hyped for the sequel.",9
it was okay,25 April 2018,,4
"Avengers Infinity War is a lot, but in a good way",9 March 2019,"Infinity War Review (10/10) Avengers Infinity War is a lot, but in a good way. Marking the passing of a decade since the conception of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Avengers: Infinity War acknowledges that Marvel's audience has grown up. There's a seemingly hopeless amount of characters packed into this story, but the Russo brothers make the bold decision to establish big bad Thanos as the primary protagonist, and the film is all the better for it. The film is very fast paced in the beginning but then it smoothes it's self out and slows. The insane amount of action and characters means that not everybody gets enough screen time, but most make an impact on the story, in some form or another. Some of the new relationships and conflicts work extraordinarily well - Doctor Strange and Tony Stark make for pitch-perfect rivals, and Star Lord's gut-wrenching jealousy toward the sculpted, hyper-masculine Thor is hilarious. Every single member of the team tries their utmost to prevent the apocalypse, and occasionally, even come infuriatingly close to overpowering Thanos. But it's never quite enough, and one important distinction between Thanos and the Avengers is repeatedly highlighted - our heroes are emotional creatures, unwilling to sacrifice their friends for the greater good, while Thanos is stone cold. The final act, including the post-credits sting, brings a chill, a darkness and a hush that represent something new in this universe. Infinity War is the first half of the final installment in the series, and it concludes with a premonition of finality. Its intimations of grief and terror feel shrewdly attuned to what is happening in the actual, unmarvelous world. Ultimately, Infinity War is a great film and one for the ages. This movie goes right into the top 5 of MCU movies and it just might be in the top 5 of all comic book movies. I recommend seeing this movie on the biggest possible screen, to experience it in it's full glory.",10
Pure excitement!,14 October 2018,"At the very moment of the movie, it was thrilling. This wonderful movie was not only the best of Marvel's movie, but also the most entertaining and exciting movie I've ever seen.",10

Really puzzling,1 May 2018,"The visuals were great, the music was great and there was some good humour. I like a lot of the previous marvel films. In this movie, I was confused in almost every scene. I felt that the characters' capabilities seemed different from what I saw in earlier movies and, a lot of the time, their actions/choices were bizarre and unfounded. I was often thinking ""Why did...?"" ""and How on earth did...?"" ""Whaaat?"" Having so much of this confusion in the fast-paced, action-packed movie ruined it for me :( I wish it happened otherwise...",4

It had a some flaws the CGI wasn't the best, it was not bad but it could be better. And Thanos henchman didn't had much impact on the story and were in my eyes killed of way too early. The acting was great from nearly every charakter. In the Comics Thanos story is way better explained, ok this would be to much for a single movie. Without that so some times its a bit hard understand why he is doing what he is doing.",10
What we are expecting from Marvel,12 May 2018,"Finally Marvel is delivering a real super-hero movie that doesn't look like a Disney fairy-tale. And what a movie. From the first second to the last, you get into the story and the action.

But I think it should've been longer, because it did feel like a two parter. But go watch it it's worth the money. My favorite quote "" perfectly balanced as all things should be"".",8
"THIS MOVIE!! ah, I can't",10 May 2018,Another great comic book movie from Marvel. I love every bit of it. Can't wait to see what happens next in Marvel Saga.,10
Best Marvel movie ever made,12 January 2019,"This movie kicks so much ash that i cant think of another superhero movie that have maked me so exited and impressed after leaving the cinema. There is nothing wrong with this film, acting amazing, characters you just care about and a story that tales you on a journey you wont forget any time soon. One word masterpiece.",10

This movie is hard to comprehend,19 August 2018,"For me, the worst Avengers to date. What's this movie? The first of many to come in a series? I do not know. It's by far the weakest scenarios of all the Avengers series. I gave it a 3/10 for those reasons. Very dissapointed and bad movie.",3

I got some questions,14 March 2021,,8
Fun yet flawed,29 April 2018,"This movie somehow has the ability to keep you entertained for nearly three hours, but it has its problems. As good as the story and villain are you can't ignore the elephant in the room, you need to see nearly every marvel movie to understand what is going on. Thankfully if you have seen enough marvel movies to understand the plot you will be treated with a fantastic and dark story with a great villain! Just if you haven't seen a marvel movie and want to watch this, don't. You won't enjoy yourself. If you have this will be to you one of the best movies of the year up to this point",8
Killing half of the universe??,1 February 2019,,8
Very nice movie,12 May 2018,It is good movie. My friends enjoyed it a lot and they are willing to go and watch it again.,8
i love iron man,20 March 2020,It's beyond my expectation. Some emotional climax comes from villains. It's sad to watch the film. It reminds me of the ghost story of the saint fighter I chased when I was a child. When one gold saint fighter died.,8
First time i'm disapointed with Avengers sereis,28 April 2018,"SPOILER: This movie too many cocktail superhero character to handle. only thing i'm happy Thor got his eye back. Hulk is Scared and he don't wanna come out.. Lol, Missed whole movie with hulk character rather than first 5mnts. still don't understand how they miss Superman,batman,Donald duck and tom&Jerry in this movie. worst 3D, people were killing the time with mobile phones . this year so far my best entertainment film is Rampage after the movie everybody was clapping that how movie should be...............!!",4
Excellent for such a compilation,28 April 2018,"SO for so many characters to be assembled in a movie, I thought it was well done without feeling too over packed. The plot developed at an appropriate pace and there was still character development. I was a bit dissapointed that The Gaurdians of the Galaxy so readily split apart(it just doesn't go with the family message of their last film). I was extremely dissapointed that Marvel has eliminated Captain America. Never was his super hero name mentioned in the film. No more red, white and blue; he now wears black. No more stars on the chest or shield. He now introduces himself as ""Steve Rogers"". And every reference is to ""Cap"" or ""Captain"" at best. Shame to see the iconic hero being changed for the sake of international ticket sales.",9
Beautifully Constructed,3 May 2018,"I worried about how well executed this film would be because of how large the cast is. I clearly didn't need to though. This film is worth every minute of its 2.5 hours.

The flow of each character's individual story and their connection to the over all plot is done seamlessly. It is never focus too long on one area and you are moved from one scene to the next in a way that doesn't feel jarring. I was completely immersed into the story.

I only give it nine stars because it made me cry and I'm mad about it.",9
Excellent!,17 January 2019,The most different film i have ever seen among Marvel movies.,10
All Good,21 December 2018,It was highly anticipated and waiting for the second part.,8
Unreal,1 May 2019,"One of the best movies i have ever watched, the ending was unreal",10
Done,17 February 2019,"Idk how many times I've watched this movie. I just cant get enough of it. It's now my fav movie of all time... Waiting for ""End Game"" so badly.. This movie is just love. If you haven't watched it then what on earth are you doing!",10
Everything I wanted and more,16 December 2018,"Yea, this movie is it. Super engaging plot, hilarious characters, and dramatic beats that feel earned by the end. I love Thanos--he's one of the greatest villains in recent times because he's actually a threat. Cap, Iron Man, Bruce, Spidey, T'Challa, the Guardians, Thor, Vision, Wanda--they're all great and this movie wouldn't be what it is without them. I don't know what to say. I've seen it 3 times at this point and liked it more every time. Marvel has been hitting it out of the park for years and this really is the crown everybody calls it.",10
"Nice picture, poor sense",30 April 2018,"This film seems like aggregation of Marvel movie experience. It has large budget, cool effects, nice costumes, good actors, funny humor. Still same as other Marvel creatures, it's completely empty regarding it's script. No logical decisions from characters, most of the time it feels like they are completely stupid. Each 3-4 min I facepalmed after some scene. It was pretty painful to watch it. Is it so hard to spend more money on story and kick ass of those, who create stupid episodes?",5
Best superhero movie of our time,15 May 2021,This movie shows how to end a perfect saga with giving it a new amazing start.,10
Epic!!!,29 April 2018,"Spoiler Free Review! What an amazing and epic adventure! My only regret is not seeing it in IMAX. (I probably will) Contrary to my expectations, no characters were over done and none were wasted. A great balance of the most beloved and the ""new to the show"". This film was nothing like the ""super boring and confusing"" Age of Ultron, or the ""funny but forgettable"" Guardians 2, or the ""not as great the second time around"" Thor Ragnarok. Despite its epic scale (lots of locations and lots of characters) and loose ends it had to tie up, Infinity War was surprisingly easy to follow, and totally engaging all the way through. Fun, hilarious, emotional, action packed (with lots of real stunts and not cartoony CGI), great soundtrack and totally worth seeing more than once. The directors (the Russo brothers) may have finally dethroned ""The Avengers"" as my favorite MCU movie. Civil War is a close second, also directed by the Russo brothers. Those guys were a great addition to the MCU. Fantastic film, I can't wait to watch it again and no one spoil it for anyone!",10
Excellent Awaited,27 April 2018,"I wait for this from 27 Jan,2017 Since the shoot was stared.i see it today i can't explain how really it great but climax makes me wait for 1 year.Thanos was very crusial with emotional villain and did wonderful job by josh brollin.Wanda Ane Specially Thor Have amazing power inside movie.You will be shocked after you watch this if you are die hard fan of Marvel just like me.",10
Sublime interweaving of characters,28 April 2018,"Loved it from start to finish. Brutal and dark at times but still with that classic Marvel comedic charm to break it up. Thought the way the characters were written into the story was brilliant and clever, it can't have been easy trying to decide what happens with so many superheroes involved.

All in all my favourite Marvel film to date. Thanos was exactly what I wanted and his Children were brilliant.

Epic.",10
Best Of MCU,27 January 2019,This is easily and clearly the best MCU movie made to date. The tone and feel of this movie is matchless when comparing to other MCU movies. No other movie in this universe so greatly portrays what you're supposed to feel through this movie. The dark and eerie feel portrayed through the coloration of the movie and the music helps put you in the mood you're supposed to be in. They also throw in great comic relief throughout. Every single detail and aspect of this movie is so well thought. The Russo Brothers succeeded very well with this. Can't wait to see how they conclude the story in Endgame.,10
Marvel's Version of the Empire Strikes Back,28 April 2018,"I've always been saying that this generation, whilest the Star Wars franchise is still going strong, the Marvel Cinematic is this generation's Star Wars. And Infinity Wars is one of it's finest work. Everything from the beginning all the way to the end, just resonates with action and drama throughout. I have watched this twice and I barely even noticed the two hours pass by up to the final scene. Marvel have truly made you invest in the characters to the point where you are happy or sad for what happens to each of them. And much like the Empire Strikes Back, it makes you want to see it again and come back for more when all is said and done.",10
I love Avengers movie series,9 May 2018,,8
"not funny, didn't laugh.",1 August 2019,,1
Near flawless,27 April 2018,"I left the cinema absolutely astounded at this film. The action is immaculate, and at times, had me fist-pumping the air. There is also a lot of humour, as expected, but make no mistake, this is probably the darkest film in the MCU. Thanos is without doubt the best villain in the series, he was 100% worth the wait. I was particularly impressed with how they fit in every character in the film perfectly, every character interaction was amazing. And the ending left me completely speechless. Just go and watch this film.",10
Every aspect from what marvel had in comic books were there,28 April 2018,,10
Another Brilliant Chess Move,30 April 2018,"I was so anxious and anticipatory of this movie that I bought tickets for it a month in advance. I couldn't wait to see the culmination of the various chess moves Marvel had been making over the last 10+ years. How could this movie be anything short of spectacular?

OK, I'd be lying if I said it was spectacular but it was darn good. One of the biggest questions I had going in was how Marvel would showcase the numerous talents. How could they possibly give adequate screen time to the important characters such as Captain America, Thor, Iron-Man, Spider Man, Hulk, Black Panther, Doctor Strange and the Guardians of the Galaxy? Not to mention the secondary characters such as Vision, Scarlet Witch, Black Widow, Falcon, War Machine and others. Then, what kind of villain... no, super-villain could Marvel cook up that would require the assembly of such talents?

To the first question: I think they gave proper focus to the right characters. Some characters were more important than others and some had doper fight scenes than others (ahem, Iron Man, Spider Man, Doctor Strange) but they all got in on the action.

To the second question: Thanos was not just a super villain, he was a super badass villain. He was so bad that even his henchmen could've been primary villains. Thanos was legendary status. He wasn't some amorphous super being, nor was he a science experiment gone wrong or just some very powerful maniac. Thanos was a force and his demeanor made him that much more sinister. He carried himself like he was destined for greatness and the steps to that greatness, however brutal, were just the necessary steps to get to where he needed to be. He was impressive to say the least.

The movie was excellent even if it wasn't quite what I expected. We got to see some major upgrades from Iron Man and Spider Man. We got to see Avenger-like team work with cross-over characters. We got to see boss level heroism and self-sacrifice. We got to see major moral dilemmas. And we got to see an inter-galactic plot. If you haven't seen the movie then prepare yourself and don't be angry with all that happens just be patient because this movie is just one more brilliant chess move by the MCU.",8
infinity war more like infinity bore am i right ladies,6 May 2018,"The thrilling saga of a purple space man who acts as an analogy for american occupation of the middle east. lots of video game inspired action that is sure to keep the children of the audience entertained while adults lust over the visions perfectly sculpted abs. overall a fun time, especially the ending.",8
A Rollercoaster of Emotions,27 April 2018,"If you're not a fan of the MCU or Marvel you'll be losing of the best of experience you could ever have at the cinema. The Russo Brothers made a masterpiece. The best movie in the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe. Right off the bat, the movie starts with a lot of power and engages you immediately, there's time to breathe during the first half with a joke here and there but after that hour has passed, the tension just keeps on building and it doesn't break even after the movie has ended. Josh Brolin was an amazing Thanos, as he nails the role so perfectly. Always the most overpowering, intimidating and fear-provoking character in the room. This is the first time you can feel that the Avengers are going to have a struggle finishing their task and lose some of their integrants knowing they have to give it their all due to what there's at stake. Every single actor in this movie (Downey Jr., Cumberbatch, Holland, Ruffalo, Olsen, Johansson, Pratt, Bautista, etc.) does their respective character so well and the outstanding dialogue just makes it that much better of a performance. Got to give props for the Russo Brothers at how they manage to handle every single Avenger sufficient screen-time without leaving us needing more or less of one superhero with already an enormous cast. One of the things I loved and hated about this movie was ending. The finale was such an amazing part of the story. You literally cannot know what's going to happen after the events presented in this film which makes it that much better. All and all, this has become one my favorites. Definitely going to watch it again at the theater and must say to you for you to do so as well. Probably a movie we won't ever get again in years to come.",10
A well done movies,20 May 2018,"Considering it's a superheroes movie, it stands as one of the best.",10
The Mix Hit All the Flavors,10 September 2018,"The storyline begins it's end run with Thanos (Brolin) on his mission to collect ALL the infinity stones. The film jumps around quite often but engages the audience with the Avengers spread out and fighting separate battles. The question WHAT does Thanos really want. The answer is not trivial as we see in his dialogue and speeches, world domination and to kill half the population with the snap of his fingers.

The fight sequences as usual are tremendously done and the CGI is completely amazing. There are some funny quips along the way, inside plots and story's we see expanding. I truly liked the film BUT I was not prepared for the loss of heroes we had to suffer. I look forward to the next installment to see what happens. I give this a 9 out of 10.",9
"Please, I beg you, see reason.",28 April 2018,"Before I proceed, let me clarify one point. I happen to see the film in Australia on the 25th and left the cinema in a rather good mood. The next day i found myself on IMDB - I'm a huge movie fan - and saw that this movie had a 9.2. A 9.2!!! Immediately I thought it was some glitch. And yet today it is 9.1.

By all means the movie was decent. Perhaps a 6/10 or 7 if you really like the marvel universe (it is one of my guilty pleasures). But stop handing out 10/10 scores as if they were pamphlets and not gold (which they should be considered). This movie was not great. It adds nothing to the realm of cinema. It was not thought provoking whatsoever. It was simple entertainment. And do not mistake me, this is what we should expect. I love mindless action and so on. It pains me to see these reviews. I have given it a 1 to counter the mindless stream of 10's being granted despite myself truly thinking the film deserves a 7/10.

To conclude, it's a fun film. But far from the greats. Far from them indeed.",1
Good Movie,12 September 2018,The movie is a must watch. The graphics and CGI are all good. Cannot wait for the second part. The movie left me speechless. I would recommend for anyone who like action movies and if they liked any superhero movie.,10
Lives Up to the Hype,15 November 2018,,9
Did not Disappoint!,18 January 2019,"To be honest, with 10 years worth of movies backing this movie, it makes it hard for newcomers if this was your first movie, but the Russos did an amazing job on this movie ""yes it works!"" Amazing color, actors, story(though doesn't follow the Infinity Gauntlet comics at all), design, BGM. Every scene in this movie screams ""epic"" ! Nuff said. Pretty sure everyone has seen it by now...",9

10 All The Way Through,28 April 2018,"Marvel definitely came through with this one. This movie had me captured from the very beginning and it didn't fail to let go. There were different stories that all came together in such a harmonious way. So good yet sad. I stayed til all the credits were over, but I don't know what that star symbol was that Samuel Jackson was calling. 10 Stars across the board!",10
Mind Blowing Film,4 October 2018,"Really a great film to watch. A lot of action and twists in only two and half hour long movie. A new anti-hero, whose character has been crafted for over six years in previous movies and post credit scenes, is at the rise and his powers are becoming unstoppable. The cards between heroes and anti-heroes are dealt very well and a great balance between them are established. You can be excited for a lot of traumatic deaths in this film. But who knows if there be a resurrection. The ending is just hilarious and unpredictable. The DC Universe seams like a rubbish in compare with the Marvel Universe. I hope that the next movie will be at least as good as this one. Though, If you miss some Marvel movies in the past, you may have some problems with the understanding of the plot of this great movie. However as a Marvel fan it is a super movie that honourably ends a third phase of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and I am really excited for the next part.",9
Seriously?,31 August 2018,,2
Assemble Your Heart,8 May 2018,"Avengers: Infinity War

A good superhero film with tons of action, emotions and fun. Avengers Infinity War is now the biggest movie of all time with an opening for the weekend of April 27th 2018 around the world of $680 million dollars and raising each day. The Avengers assemble to take on the big purple bully Thanos who wants the 6 infinity stones for his infinity guanlet to control the universe.

The film is pretty simple to understand and I'll try to explain it without giving away spoliers and believe me I want to tell you guys what happened but I won't. I promise I will with all my power to not say any spoliers but it'll be hard. But anyway the film is about the Avengers Iron Man, Spiderman, Captain America, Black Widow etc assemble to take on Thanos who wants these stones to be the greatest villian in the universe. Now this film has been 10 years in the making and the reason I say this is because if you haven't watched the other films that feature infinity stones you'll basically be lost. No offense but why would you watch a movie like Infinity War without watching the other films. You'll be confused and out of sorts if you did, it's silly but hey that's just me I like to watch films in general so I've already seen the other Marvel films that the stones were in so I knew what where they were but if you haven't watch the films, shame on you, but I'll help you in the quest for the Infinity Stones.

There are 6 infinity stones that are scattered around the universe and these are the films where they were found. These are not spoliers because they've been discovered already so here we go. The Space Stone is inside the Tesseract in Captain America: The First Avenger which was stolen by Loki and used to attack New York in the first Avengers film. The Reality Stone was located in Thor: The Dark World which was given to The Collector who'll make an appearance in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 1 for safekeeping. Speaking of Guardians this is where we find The Power stone which was discovered by Peter Quill aka Star Lord which they gave to the Collector for safekeeping at the end of the film. The Mind Stone was seen in Avenger Age of Ultron and is inside Vision forehead where it remains until we see it in Infinity War. The Time Stone is seen in Doctor Strange which is protected by the Doctor at all times. The last stone is called a Soul Stone and we found out where and how Thanos get that gem in Infinity War.

Now the film itself was really entertaining but very emotional and of course I can't speak on that part because that would be spoilers and I don't do spoilers as I have said before. But see this film in the theaters it's worth the price of admission. I will be buying this film when it comes out on blu-ray and I'll pick up some comics to find out what's going to happen next.",8
It's possibly the best and the most darkest marvel flick you'll see ever,30 September 2018,"This the same marvel flick we always enjoy , yet personally it's the best one yet because of the suprises it packs.

This is most possibly the most darkest film in the Marvel Universe yet. It marks the start of the new era of marvel cinema , and possibly every Marvel movie you will see from now will be much darker and wilder.

There is everything in thid movie :Drama , Aomedy , Action , SciFi , Thriller , Adventure , Romance , an ending that will twist your mind. If you've heard that the ending is bad , that's because it slightly is , but the next avenger will only give true Justice to this ending.

8/10 if you've never seen any Marvel movie before",9
Amazing,28 April 2018,"This film is just as Good as Civil War. I'm deeply impressed as to how the movie stood very well with the overstuffung of many characters and making every single one of them play a part in this fantastic superhero brawl and mashup! There are little to no subplots, only one goal. This movie did much justice to captivate a true superhero film with your favorites and not so favorites with an impressive villain with a true purpose to stop at nothing until he gets what he wants. One of the top five best films of all time HANDS DOWN! No spoilers, expect the best, and the worst.",10
Mind-Blowing,28 April 2018,"Theres a lot of stories happening at the same time so, dont lose any minute of this movie! Its breathtaking!",10
WOW,28 April 2018,"This movie has it all. It ties up a lot of loose ends, along with opening new doors for new chapters of the MCU. Every character, good or bad was relevant and had input that was valuable to the movie and not just filling in a bit of screen time. But the true hero of the movie is Josh Brolins fantastic portrayal of the mad Titan Thanos. Had it not been CGI character he could actually be a contender for a major acting award. But this is also thanks to the writers and directors. I would give it a 10, but nothing is perfect. However this is as close to perfect as a comic book movie could ever be. D.C just give up. Again. WOW.",10
Number 1 marvel movie out of past others,5 May 2018,"This movie has everything what a movie should have.

Just not for me,3 August 2018,"My apologies to all the fans but in my old man opinion this was not the movie that the hype led me to believe. Yes the ""effects"" were amazing and most of the jokes funny but other than that it seemed so predictable as to be boring. Again this is just the opinion of a grandpas that heard his grandsons talking about how amazing and at the same time sad this movie was. I believe that for someone to truly enjoy this epic, they would have to invested a large amount of time learning and watching this genre would have gotten much more out of this movie. As just entertainment it did not do the job for me. My sincere apologies again to all the fan boys and girls, this show just did not hit the spot.",3

A super hero movie with emotion...,11 May 2021,My first ever Hollywood movie in a cinema and that too a 3d movie...without watching its trailer i just went there....knowing the fact that marvel always gives its ending at the end of movie...but then this movie finished....i remember crying two times and at end i wasn't ready to get up.....i was struck right there....my mind was frozen....and then i came home and i don't remember how many times i have rewatched this masterpiece....for me this was the movie which deserved 100 out of 10.....and i was so happy that i saw it at the screeen....,10
"Entertaining, epic and extraordinary, a masterpiece in the superhero genre",19 April 2019,"A huge production that became one of the most expensive movies of all time and with that huge budget they created something big, something superb. The movie is simply astonishing and epic, having a crew and cast filled with people that is extraordinary at their job. It's my second time watching this as I'm getting ready to see the anticipating sequel, Endgame which I believe will be better than this one. The Russo Brothers created a masterpiece in the superhero genre and will hopefully be remembered for years to come in the film industry. The visual effects are astonishing, probably the best Marvel have ever done after the Guardians of the Galaxy movies. At first I thought it didn't deserve 10/10 but after re-watching it I've to say it really does as it's incredible and the writing are actually perfect, one of the best Marvel stories to date as it's unpredictable and unique.

The ensemble cast is superb, simply beyond great. Their chemistry is what makes the characters work as they show how good they work together in the fight sequences and overall at anytime. The fight sequences are perfect, giving us well choreographed fights with the characters working in ways that wouldn't be possible if there wouldn't have been a bunch of movies of them teaming up together and getting to know each other personally. Josh Brolin is the true star as the villain Thanos, a character so evil but he manages to make him a character with emotion and human, mostly for the writing but his acting and performance is special and goes down to the best villain of the Marvel movies.",10
What the hell???!! Why was this such a big success??? CGI Deluxe with no realism whatsoever...,11 June 2019,"It honestly baffles the mind as to why this film was such a huge box office success. I didn't like the original 'The Avengers', I loved 'Avengers: Age of Ultron', and now I'm back to not liking 'Avengers: Infinity War'.

Firstly, I mean there are way too many characters in this film!! We have the original Avengers Iron Man, Captain America, Hulk, Black Widow and Thor (no Hawkeye in this installment). Now they've added the entire Guardians of the Galaxy crew, Scarlet Witch and Vision from 'Age of Ultron', Black Panther, Doctor Strange, War Machine, Falcon, Winter Soldier and Spider-man. (What the hell is he doing here???). Loki is back, although only for a (very) short while. Bloody hell, that's a LOT of protagonists for ONE FILM!! With so many characters I actually forgot about some of them when they were not on screen. I mean, Iron Man and Captain America literally were on screen only for a few minutes the entire film! They are also unrecognizable (Thor with short hair, Captain American with a beard and moustache, Black Widow now blonde...) It was way more fun when each character had his own film.

Just like 2012's 'The Avengers' this film plays like a medley of superhero films, and not a standalone film. 'Infinity War' was also too fantastical with not an inch of reality. There was not a single screen without CGI and blue or green screen effects. It felt like I was watching a video game. The film clearly illustrates how CGI is taken much too far in films. Oh, so now Iron Man's mask just disappears? And Spider-man's too? And Quill?? Were all of their superhero suits designed by the same person??? It looked silly and felt fake, choosing the easy way out.

I found the film boring. I hated 'Black Panther', so needless to say I didn't enjoy any of the Wakanda/Black Panther scenes. This was pure CGI and no excitement whatsoever. Iron Man's suit doesn't look as believable as it did in the first 'Iron Man'. It looks too obvious CGI. My favorite character was the antagonist Thanos, who was probably the deepest character of all, and I completely understood his intentions.

I couldn't wait for this installment to end. Oh, thank goodness...But, oh dear me, this is Part 1 of 2...",3

Just WOW!,27 April 2018,"Infinity War was AMAZING! An awesome culmination of 10 years and 18 films. I must say that Thanos was pretty badazz. I would venture to say the best villain in the MCU at this point, by leaks and bounds. I ventured as far as checking out some spoilers for the film because I was so snaxious and GLAD to find that almost most of that was false! The actual events in the movie were action-packed from the opening scenes. It was essentially a series of third acts. This movie is filled with surprises and great humor. Thor might be my favorite character after IW and Ragnarok.

Now I can't wait to see it again, and to see the upcoming movies for the MCU. The next few years for Marvel/Avengers will be quite interesting. This just may be my favorite film in the MCU, for now.",10

Two thumbs up!,24 February 2019,WOW! No wonder any movie related to any avengers character would be a guarantee box office!! Every character has his own charm. The computer graphic is so over the top!! Well done~,9
Volume imbalance,21 August 2018,I like this type of movie but would have liked it a lot more if I didn't have to keep turning the volume up and down because the music is louder the talking. Maybe it works in a theater but for watching it at home volume could be balanced out considerably more. I'm writing this as I watch it. I've gotten to the point where they arrived at Nidavellir and I thats where I had to stop watching.,3
Totally awesome,18 September 2018,The movie is worth a watch. Thanos is awesome and rest of the character also good,9
peace and love,19 May 2020,Miss the movie miss the heroes miss the time i watched the movie,9
Very good,27 April 2018,"Be prepared to have your expectations for the film, met. And your expectations for how poorly the crowds will behave around you, dismally disappointing. This movie would be perfect if it weren't for the obnoxious fans.",8
10 Years in the making... and it delivers!!!,1 May 2019,,10
"Beautiful, Dark, Intense, and Perfect",27 April 2018,"As a comic book fan, and lover of all superheroes, I had somewhat low expectations for this movie. I assumed it would be just fine. How wrong I was. It was completely unexpected, intense, and a complete emotional roller coaster. Although it had several flaws, they were minor and didn't take away from the story. I believe there's a new generation of filmmaking on the horizon, complete with ultra-realistic, virtual-reality graphics, and this movie packs a punch in that department.",10

Great Movie!,3 August 2018,"I've seen a lot and I mean A LOT of great shows/movies in my lifetime so I'm at the age where I NEVER ever watch something twice. I usually just watch a movie and then never see it again because I like to watch the new stuff! But THIS MOVIE!....

Was the first movie that I've watched more than one time in a looooooong time!

It lived up to the hype. People was telling me how good it was so I had HIGH expectation. There are like 18 movies that lead up to this movie and they did a teaser trailer like 5-6 years ago so my expectations were big and...

It didn't let me down!

I still don't know why some people would give this a bad rating.",10
Compelled me to write my first review,20 September 2018,"Me and my 5 yrs old daughter enjoyed every bit of this film. How new teams form up was exciting. Team work was entertaining. I wished more from Banner... Hulk did almost no thing, so did Natasha.. But eagerly waiting for Thanos to be back. Thanos was nice!",8
"""This movie will blow your mind""...",5 March 2019,"As someone recently wrote, this movie will really blow your mind.

This is the movie that ultimately made my dig extremely deep into the Marvel Universe for the first time. My first reaction of it was absolute disappointment followed by extreme cravings on finding out what would happen next. Well, to be honest, I nearly cried in the end of the movie. This made buy more Marvel Comics that I think I first could've even afford. I realized after a short while that this movie, due to my reaction, is the most brilliant I've seen for a long while.",10

First Movie to Leave Me in Awe,3 May 2018,"I've seen a lot of great movies, some even recently, but Avengers: Infinity War gave me this feeling that no movie has been able to accomplish. I was constantly thrilled by the action and on the edge of my seat through every exciting outcome. When I had left the theatre, my friend had said that I had cried like I had lost a family member. The characters I grew up with, the character who I've seen develop through the years and to see their emotions and their reactions. It's fascinating and heartbreaking. This movie grabbed my attention the moment it started and didn't lose any focus. I'd recommend the MCU to anyone just to have them watch this movie. Congrats to the Russo brothers for making such a breath-taking experience! I can't wait for Captain Marvel and Avengers 4!",10
This movie is a kid emptying his toy box on the floor,7 May 2020,"Once you get past how cool it is to see all these characters on screen together, this movie is very lacking. The characters have no consistency, the deaths are hollow and are just there for shock value since we all know they won't say dead, the power levels of the characters and the stones fluctuate to fit what the plot needs. This is a very flawed film, but with that said I still think it's the best marvel film by far. The action and Thor's subplot are both good and Thanos is great, his character holds the movie together.",8
Pleasantly surprised by this one,17 March 2019,"I'm not a huge over the top marvel fan by any means but I do like some of them. I loved Wonder Woman and this one as well. There were a lot of characters and storyline but I wasn't bored and was quite impressed actually. Good emotion, heart, comical moments and of course action. I liked being introduced to the Guardians of the Galaxy because I've never seen any of those movies. Overall I liked this one and was very entertained!",8
So much... more,27 April 2018,Thoroughly entertaining and gut wrenching! I loved the juxtaposition of the different character worlds coming together.,10
An Achievement,15 May 2019,"Whether or not you are a fan of the MCU, you have to admit that this film will be a part of cinematic history. The MCU is a massively successful franchise, a franchise that has made more money than any other franchise in history (true, there are more films in this franchise, but that's still an accomplishment). Not all of the films in this franchise are good, but almost all of them are watchable (at least once). This film was really good, but, like I said above, you really have to put in the work if you want to reap the rewards. If you like the MCU, you already know you're going to see this movie anyways, and you're probably willing to forgive it for most of its flaws. This movie is absolutely worth seeing. It won't win any large awards at the Oscars next year, but it's certainly a very well done and extremely entertaining comic book movie; in the end, that's why we came to the theatre.",8
Infinity excitement...!!!,27 April 2018,I expected a lot about Infinity War.But the movie was beyond my imagination. It broke all my expectations.I didn't expect a movie like this.I am damn sure that this movie is one of the best MCU movie ever made.I still wondering how Russo brothers managed to direct this movie with many characters.I was tensed about the movie how would be the scenes with many characters.But Russo brothers managed it well.The movie was super.Entry of each characters made me excited.I was anxious what would happen next n each scenes.The climax of the movie really made me shocked.It was a great surprise for me.And it made llittle tension in me.It made me to wait for the next Avengers movie.I can't wait to watch the next Avengers movie.But unfortunately the next movie will release only next year.I am sad about that.But I will wait for it.Finally the movie was a great experience.,8

With a premise so high, for the most ambitious crossover ever. It is really refreshing to see a movie, that can take that premise. and make it big like marvel can.",8
Great movie,25 July 2018,"I have to admit, before seeing this movie, I didn't take time to re-watch all of the previous MCU films. I still enjoyed Infinity War very much! The action scenes are breath-taking, the character development is fantastic, and the ending is emotional-it broke my heart. After seeing Infinity War, I re-watched all 20+ MCU movies in the following days, and you know what, I was really amazed by how this story was prepared since day 1, and carried out so well. All movies and post-credit scenes combined made so much sense for the plot of Infinity War. The best character, which I wasn't expecting, was Thanos. He was not some villain who just want to control or destroy the world. Thanos character was built with deep emotion, and a real good reason for his action. I am not good with words, so I cannot express how much I enjoy this film. I really recommend anyone who is going to watch this, re-watch the 20+ MCU movies first. Check on Youtube for how to watch MCU movies in the correct timeline order, don't watch them based on their year of release.",10
WOW! WHAT A RIDE.,28 April 2018,"It's been building to these 2 films. Within the first 5 minuets I knew this IS THE BEST film from the MCU. It had many answers to questions we've pondered from the start. I truly laughed & cried all the way through, over the years these characters have become friends & I felt everything they were feeling. The effects have improved greatly over the years, this film certainly blew your mind, smooth & flawlessly. We are certainly in for a huge treat with part 2.",10
VERY STRONG 8 OR WEAK 9,28 April 2018,"A must see spoiler free. It's a remarkable achievement that so many characters are given something to do and with enough direction and ""film"" to make us care about it. The Russo brothers top their Civil War efforts, barely, but do indeed manage to bring us a clear story arc that doesn't waste time on unnecessary issues. I will rank this below their efforts in Winter Soldier, again barely. There was more espionage intrigue in that movie that was more satisfying to this viewer. But, in the current culture where superhero movie fatigue is a very real concern, and hype regarding superhero movies tends toward inflation of its true merit for entertainment, this monument should stand as a tight culmination of just about EVERY point raised and debated from the first Thor to last year's Thor. Which I find fitting and I'll refrain from saying more.

Grade: A- Recommend",9
NIce Movie,24 May 2018,,8
Best marvel movie to date,2 May 2018,The movie is amazing. Rotten tomatoes score is ridiculous should be 100%,9
Depressing non-heroic CGI slog,7 May 2018,"Infinity War could have been a great film if they just summarized the grueling excessive CGI fighting and war, cutting an hour from the length, giving time for a bit more of a breather and ending the main film with a message of hope and not in a post-credits teaser that relies entirely on outside comic-book knowledge. Most people I know go to see superhero movies for the escapism and to feel the triumphs of good over evil - sometimes even by the common man rising up. Marvel sometimes gets props for blurring the lines, creating complex flawed heroes, sympathetic villains and hard choices. But there still need to be the broad strokes of victory (even if with sacrifice). Congratulations, Marvel and the Russo Brothers, you've managed to out-bleak the darkest DC movies and I think it is a cheat of the worst kind that you will in some way ""fix"" this over several future movies. I have not felt this depleted in a long time after seeing a movie and I've heard others walking out of the theatre (or in these reviews) saying they may never watch another Marvel film if the sole focus is on stringing along the franchise and effects instead of telling a compelling tale within reasonable bounds of a single film. My recommendation is to wait for video release and not reward the producers for such a half-hearted first Act without including the rest of the (potentially epic) story.",4

Full of amazing surprises!!,1 May 2018,"Arguably best marvel movie so far! you dont have to worried about marvel movies who have been known to be too light and have too many scenes that break the moment or too many not well timed jokes or unfunny jokes etc. it have jokes in it but its just the right amount not too many and IT IS funny i mean like real funny. and it can make you hold your breath for almost from the start to the end of the movie. it have a lot of suspenseful moments. and there's one post credit scene YOU DONT WANNA MISS! luckily i didnt know what the post credit scene was until i saw it myself at the theatre and i just smile outside but was screaming inside like a little child when i finally saw it. man im gonna watch it for the second time and im still as enthusiastic as i was before i watched the movie for the first time.

This is definitely is one of the better films of the series.,12 May 2018,"Avengers: Infinity (2018)

This is an American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics superhero team the Avengers. It is the nineteenth film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). It features an ensemble cast including Robert Downey Jr., Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Benedict Cumberbatch, Don Cheadle, Tom Holland, Chadwick Boseman, Paul Bettany, Elizabeth Olsen, Anthony Mackie, Sebastian Stan, Danai Gurira, Letitia Wright, Dave Bautista, Zoe Saldana, Josh Brolin, and Chris Pratt. The story is simple. The Avengers and Guardians of the Galaxy attempt to stop Thanos from amassing the all-powerful Infinity Stones. As of May 10, 2018, Avengers: Infinity War has grossed a worldwide total of $1.275 billion. It has received generally favorable reviews. Audiences gave the film an average grade of ""A"". This film has so much going on, it could have been longer or split into two films without degrading the quality. There are some plot issues I question, but I won't go into details and spoil the film. This is definitely is one of the better films of the series. The last three have seen a solid quality boost.",8
Quite the Rollercoaster,28 April 2018,"I knew this movie was going to be good going into it but I never could've imagined that this was going to be the outcome. I'm rather partial to Marvel movies and genuinely enjoy most of them but I think that this insane, wild and amazing crossover was the best of all of them. It was hilariously funny and tragically sad. I loved every minute of it.",10
Most fun you would have at a marvel movie!,30 April 2018,,10
Mindblowing,26 February 2019,"'Avengers: Infinity War' is the culmination of most of the heroes of the Marvel cinematic universe, and it's a very good movie. Thanos is a terrifying villain which you dread seeing because you know once you see him, something bad is going to happen and there will be major consequences. Groups are split up and sent on different missions but are all for the same goal. The characters we know and love aren't really developed anymore considering they've already been developed before, but the most development comes in Thanos who for a CG character who is trying to murder half the universe, is a sympathetic character who thinks he's right. The acting is brilliant, standout being Josh Brolin as Thanos who makes the character feel real. The visual effects are mind-blowing as everything feels so real, it should feel goofy and ridiculous but it isn't. The music is decent but nothing mind-blowing the Avengers theme is a nice touch to hear often. The movie sometimes struggles in terms of cutting back and forth between many characters. It is a nitpick as it basically juggles all the characters perfectly. Expectations are subverted, all your awful theories are wrong as Marvel is very creative and utilizes it's advantage in having many movies before this one. It was worth the 10 year wait.",9
A marvelous epic,25 June 2024,"""Avengers: Infinity War,"" directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, is a monumental entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, bringing together a vast array of characters from across the franchise. The film centers on the Avengers and their allies as they attempt to stop the powerful Thanos, played by Josh Brolin, from obtaining all six Infinity Stones and enacting his devastating plan.

One of the film's standout features is its ability to balance a large ensemble cast while giving each character meaningful moments. The interactions between heroes like Iron Man, Thor, and Doctor Strange are particularly engaging, and the film deftly blends action, humor, and emotional depth.

Thanos himself is a highlight, portrayed not just as a villain but as a complex character with a chillingly rational motivation. Brolin's performance adds a layer of gravitas to the character, making him one of the most compelling antagonists in the MCU.

Visually, the film is spectacular, with stunning special effects and epic battle sequences that keep the audience on the edge of their seats. While the movie's pacing can feel a bit overwhelming due to the sheer number of plotlines, it successfully sets the stage for a dramatic conclusion.

Overall, ""Avengers: Infinity War"" is a thrilling and ambitious film that delivers on its promise of epic superhero action, making it a must-watch for Marvel fans.",8
A non-movie,30 November 2018,"It took me some time to watch this. Overall a good experience but this is not a film in the traditional sense...Sure, it's overwhelmed with liberal preaching and awesome action, but at the end of the day, it's more of a filler. Cheap thrills don't work on me, sorry, not sorry.",5
Entertaining,30 April 2018,"Still below the dark knight, very entertaining for all people, make curious for the next movie",8
King of the MCU! SPOILER-FREE,28 April 2018,"Having dodged spoilers for the past few days, I finally saw Avengers: Infinity War today. Let me tell you, it BLEW ME AWAY! I've been a Marvel fanboy since I was a kid and this is one of those movies you see and then just play moments over and over again in your head. You may think with all those stars and heros in there that things can get a little messy and confusing and the Russo brothers sorted it all out perfectly. I'd say the real star would have to be Brolin as Thanos. The presence commanded by him in every scene he's in is amazing! The way you see this shadowy character unfold over 2 1/2+ hours is something I had yet to see in another Marvel film. There are surprises you don't see coming, the trailers did a great job at not giving anything away so be prepared to scoop your jaw off the floor when it ends. Definitely leading up to part 2 as there's A LOT left hanging when everything wraps up and that post credit scene rolls.",10
Must see,9 September 2019,Love it this is by far the best marvel movie it is just like it made it for me,9
The most entertaining movie I've ever seen!,10 October 2018,"Now based on the title card. I'm not saying this is the best movie I've ever seen nor am I saying that this is my favorite movie. However, from beginning to end I was hooked and impressively entertained with all of the scenes in this movie. Avengers: Infinity War will have you laughing, crying, and filled with rage. Combining all of these elements into a very emotional film. All of the payment from the last 10 years of Marvel movies is definitely worth it in this movie. The performances are great, each character serves a purpose to the story, and it probably has some of the funniest lines out of any Marvel movie apart from Thor: Ragnarok. The plot doesn't have a lot of depth and seems very simple. But if you've seen all the previous movies leading up to this one you won't even care. Please do not watch this movie if you are being introduced for the first time to the MCU. You will be confused and not care about the characters. Go watch all the MCU movies before seeing this one. This movie was one heck of an experience and I know I will be seeing plenty more of it in the future! WAKANDA FOREVER!!!",9
Would've Been Great with a More Accomplished Director,28 May 2018,"Marvel Studios laid all of the groundwork for what should've been the greatest Marvel film. But they hired the bland-as-hell directing team of the Russo Brothers again.

Minus One star for their direction which lacks focus. It feels like they are just organizing actors, not directing them. So many wide shots with people standing around just talking or fighting.

Minus One star for the overdone, unrealistic CGI backgrounds. The only locales that look real are the ones taking place in NYC. Way too much green screen.

Minus One star for some of the false emotional beats. I felt a little embarrassed for getting all sad about one particular character's demise when I realized they were just setting us up for a big ""Gotcha!"" moment with the next Avengers movie.",8

THIS IS WHY I WATCHED ALL THESE MEDIOCRE MOVIES,25 May 2024,"Wow!! This was almost perfect this is how you handle a whole movie long climax everyone and everything just blends in so beautifully whatever time you spend in watching previous movies gets paid off here every characters get their shining moment (barring few ants) I loved so many different characters interacting and a major credit also goes to the dialogue writers very fun and iconic dialogues. But the main star who tied the movie together was definitely thanos finally a villian with a strong purpose history and actual power to pose a genuine threat he was amazing in this movie

FAVOURITE CHARACTER :: tony stark (although there were many candidates like Wanda,cap,thor,dr strange even thanos but in this movie tony just felt kind of person you want to watch more of) FAVOURITE MOMENT :: many many moments were amazing iconic dialogues, amazing fight sequences, shout worthy entrances but my favourite moment was reversal of vision by thanos that was brutal although battle of titan is pretty close

These kind of movies are made once in a decade and the best a superhero movie can be. I was spoiled for the major part and still enjoyed it this much speaks volumes about the quality.",9
NEARLY PERFERCT,26 September 2018,,9
mind blowing,17 May 2018,"Over the past decade, Marvel has earned itself the benefit of the doubt. The studio has consistently delivered smart, funny, brave films that both embrace and transcend their comic-book origins. The 18 blockbuster movies produced since Iron Man first blasted off into the stratosphere in 2008 have not only reinvented superhero films as a genre - they've helped to legitimise it. Indeed, Marvel's two most recent films - Thor: Ragnarok and Black Panther - have received the kind of accolades usually reserved for edgy arthouse flicks.

And yet, it's perfectly reasonable to be apprehensive about Avengers: Infinity War. This is a blockbuster film that's been ten years in the making, its plot hinted at and scattered throughout 18 other movies. It features 30 or so characters, each with their own complex backstories and motivations. And all of them are coming together in a bid to stop a giant purple alien dude from destroying the universe. It sounds ridiculous, and feels impossible.

But that's precisely what makes the final product such a monumental achievement. Masterfully directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, Infinity War is bold, brainy filmmaking at its very best: the kind that will lift your spirits, blow your mind and shatter your soul - occasionally in the same scene. It demonstrates on an epic scale what Marvel has known all along: that special effects and tightly choreographed action are there to serve the story. For all its blockbuster spectacle (and there's almost too much of that), the film works because it's anchored by the heart, humour and humanity of its characters.

The film's basic plot is simple: Thanos (played via motion-capture by Josh Brolin), intergalactic purveyor of death and destruction, has long been on the hunt for the six Infinity Stones that will give him complete control over the elemental building blocks of the universe. He dispatches his acolytes to Earth to retrieve the Time Stone, currently in the possession of Dr. Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), and carve the Mind Stone out of the forehead of Vision (Paul Bettany). It's a literal existential threat so terrifying that all the heroes we've come to know and love - from the Avengers to the Guardians of the Galaxy - must put aside their differences and unite against a common foe.

From the outset, it's immediately clear that neither the film's directors nor screenwriters (Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely) are interested in playing it safe. Most other superhero films are bled of high stakes - the hero in the title might suffer untold trauma, but it's a super-safe bet that he or she will make it to the end alive. There's no such guarantee here. Within the first ten minutes, we are confronted with the dark, twisted depths to which Thanos and his acolytes in the Black Order will sink in order to achieve their goals. Death, as well as genuine loss and sacrifice, is intrinsic to the narrative drumbeat that drives Infinity War ever forward, and the film is all the better for it.

That's not to say the movie is a morbid and depressing experience. What's so impressive about Infinity Wars is how it expertly juggles its constantly shifting tones and moods. When it's funny (and it very often is), it's deeply, truly funny. The film finds maximum joy in flinging characters together with merry abandon, mixing and matching ones you'd never have expected to share scenes or trade banter. Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) is floored by Thor's (Chris Hemsworth) godly muscles. Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) is charmed by the wit and intelligence of Shuri (Letitia Wright). And it'd be impossible to not be utterly delighted by Peter Dinklage's inspired cameo. It's a blithely tongue-in-cheek sensibility shared by Marvel's best comic books, which understand that humour can make you care when it really counts.

And, boy, does Infinity War make it count. There are many heartbreakingly human moments threaded throughout the film: from the charming surrogate father-son dynamic shared by Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) and Peter Parker (Tom Holland), to the undeniable love that ties Vision and Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen) together. In many ways, the film stands as a testament to the human capacity not just to love, but to love fiercely and beyond all logic. It's right there when the unfailingly noble Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) declares, ""We don't trade lives"", even when giving up one could save billions.

There's even a chilling echo of it in Thanos himself. A lesser film would have turned Thanos into a one-dimensional villain, much the way he's all monster and maniac in the comic books. In Infinity War, however, Thanos' end goal is surprisingly relevant when it comes to thinking and talking about the staggeringly overpopulated world in which we live today. There is, as it turns out, method to Thanos' madness. It makes the tragic twists and turns in his relationships with his estranged adopted daughters, Gamora (Zoe Saldana) and Nebula (Karen Gillan), all the more unsettling.

For the most part, Infinity War does justice, too, to the many heroes who have been assembled for the film. The Russo brothers displayed great skill at interweaving multiple perspectives and character trajectories in Captain America: Civil War, and they do so again here, with twice as many characters. Even the most minor of supporting players, like Don Cheadle's James Rhodes/War Machine, are given story beats that land. It helps that Marvel has always taken care to cast genuinely good actors in roles that might otherwise come off as silly and slight.

Even so, there are a few standouts amongst this enormous and enormously talented cast. Emotionally speaking, this is Downey's film. He plays every note of Tony's reluctant courage and bone-deep trauma, as he embarks on what he's convinced is a suicide mission. He's ably matched by Cumberbatch, who finds vulnerability even in his character's most cunning and calculative move. Hemsworth, meanwhile, is given free rein to import the big-hearted comedic swagger of Thor: Ragnarok into this film - while also layering it with a deeply-felt, jagged grief for the losses he has suffered at the hands of Thanos and the universe.

In a film with so many moving parts, some elements don't work quite as well. A couple of characters that you might have expected to be right at the forefront - including an original Avenger or two - fade into the background. The film tumbles from dizzying fight scene to dizzying fight scene, and while most of them are fantastically choreographed, there are some purely dumb moments that literally revolve around attempts to prevent Thanos from clenching his fist. In effect, this is a superhero mêlée that's part over-the-top and part overkill, and might prove too much for those who don't already care for this franchise and the characters in it.

Minor quibbles aside, though, Infinity War is yet another step in the right direction for Marvel. It continues the studio's tradition of placing a premium on rich, complex storytelling that respects both its characters and its audiences. But it also refuses to make things easy for itself. The film ends even more bravely than it began, with a final ten minutes that will haunt and horrify you in equal measure. It's a stroke of bold, brilliant genius - a narrative risk so audacious that you'll want to follow Marvel wherever it goes next.",10

One of the best films of all time,15 February 2019,"I've seen this film probably half a dozen times at this point 3 of those while it was in the cinema. The film has such a great pacing that I never get bored. Are there thing's missing yeahh I was kinda dissapointed that a few battles are missing, but I can't dismiss what we did get for what we didn't get it as the action is still astonishing. We finally get to see the MCU come together with characters meeting and using their powers together against a familiar foe. It has an amazing soundtrack and visuals and is not afraid to keep the focus where it belongs instead of trying to give everybody equal screen time and the ending is incredible. Totally ready for End Game. I felt the need to write this review as there as so many negative reviews on here its crazy do these people have no sense of wonder or are they just bashing Marvel cause they can't stand there success? The best film in the MCU and promises more greatness in the future. Screw the haters.",10
Half the stars for half a movie,29 April 2018,,5
Marvel characters.... ASSEMBLE!,26 April 2018,"This movie includes every single marvel character so far even the guardians.

There was a lot of build up for this one movie considering Thanos is the final boss in this game. As someone that went into this movie blind I was 100% sure that there was no way Marvel could deliver.

I stand correct.

Beautifully shot, whimsical effects and well written their isn't a dull moment in the entire run time. I think Marvel heard the common complain about the villains being forgettable and death not mattering in the MCU... they said ""Here, hold my beer!""

Thanos is so well developed that he puts loki to shame. The guardians (and Thor) still managed to steal the show but with such a large cast of heroes it's understandable that some will shine brighter.

I would recommend watching this in a full theater, maybe sneak in a few teens and kids and watch their reactions to the last act. We are so sure the heroes and popular characters are safe in movies and it's the side or new characters that are on shaky grounds that emotions were running high by the end. If you've watched any of the marvel movies then this is a must for you!",10
Amazing Movie,12 September 2018,"One the the most amazing movie ever 👏🏼👍🏼😍 Best marvel movie , really loved the story especially Thanos story and how the Avengers reunion again.",10
Movie event of the decade.,31 May 2018,After 10 years of buildup Infinity War lived up to the hype and then some. Not a single character is wasted and Josh Brolin gives a memorable performance as Thanos.,9
The best movie of the year,27 April 2018,After 10 years the still surprise us Good plot amazing actors And of course huge suspense The hype for the next one is real !!!,10
Awesome Movie Theater Experience,29 April 2018,"Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.). Captain America (Chris Evans). Thor (Chris Hemsworth). Hulk (Mark Ruffalo). Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman). Spider-Man (Tom Holland). Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch). Vision (Paul Bettany). Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen). Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson). Falcon (Anthony Mackie).

Rocket Racoon (Bradley Cooper). Groot (Vin Diesel). Nebula (Karen Gillan). Thanos (Josh Brolin) is coming, and it's going to take all of these heroes (and more!) to take him and his Black Order down before he can retrieve all of the infinity stones and bring ""balance"" to the universe through mass genocide. This is a supersized movie to say the least, and ten years of Marvel movies have all been building to this movie. Since the first Avengers movie, when we saw Thanos in the post credits' scene, every single MCU film has been leading to this. You can read our ranking of all the MCU movies here. Was it worth the wait? Yes and no. Avengers: Infinity War is a fantastic movie theater experience. I felt every range of emotion I have, from anger to sadness to joy to fear. The biggest detractor of Infinity War (with no spoilers, of course) is the question of where does the story go from here, and the implications the ending has.",8
Greaaaat!,21 November 2018,"I havent watched a Marvels movie for a long time. I just think they keep on coming to often, I loose interest. But on a 12 hour flight from LA to Europe you kinda have to watch a movie or two. And maaaan this was awesome!!! Loved the mix of characters, that alone made the film awesome! How can you give this movie a 5 or even 4 out of ten? Did you guys watch the same movie as I did??

Peace!",9
Best movie,13 May 2018,Best movie of all time. Action packed awesome must watch!! Money don't matter,10
I tried to like it,19 April 2019,"I really did try, but I just couldn't make myself care. The whole film is just one big loud flashy CGI scene after another, with no time to actually feel for the characters. They also managed to make Thanos less visually scary than in the other movies? (To quote my sister: ""He looks like a big purple thumb"".)",2
Alexa Play Guru Josh's Infinity,6 July 2019,,10
In time...you will know...,28 November 2019,"This movie has clearly a much darker tone than the previous ones, but that is what makes it more special. Really cool action scenes with occasional humor made it stand out more.",8
It's Awesome,2 May 2018,Wow just shocking and blow my mind its amazing movie,9
Great MCU movie ....... but............,28 April 2018,"The movie is great and Marvel keeps kicking out fun shows. However, the logic of this scenario doesn't track. If these infinity stones are so powerful and bad, and if gathered together by Thanos they pose a threat to half the universe, then why weren't they gathered up, taken to the super-massive black hole at the center of our galaxy, launched into the gravity well and destroyed? No matter how powerful the blow-back from the stones, compared to a black hole that swallows star systems, planets, and other black holes for a snack everyday, they would be nothing. Once beyond the event horizon, NOTHING, not even Thanos could get them back.",8
"""Avengers: Infinity War"" - An Epic and Emotionally Charged Marvel Spectacle",21 July 2023,"""Avengers: Infinity War,"" released in 2018, is a monumental superhero film that defies expectations and delivers an unparalleled cinematic experience. Directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, the film brings together a vast ensemble of beloved Marvel characters, culminating in an action-packed and emotionally charged battle against the formidable villain, Thanos (Josh Brolin). With its grand scale, stellar performances, and a masterfully crafted narrative, ""Avengers: Infinity War"" is a true spectacle that leaves audiences on the edge of their seats from start to finish.

The film picks up where its predecessors left off, as the Avengers and their allies face the greatest threat they have ever encountered: Thanos, a formidable intergalactic warlord seeking to collect the all-powerful Infinity Stones to achieve his twisted vision of balance in the universe. As the Avengers and their allies race against time to prevent Thanos from assembling the Stones, the film takes audiences on a rollercoaster of emotions, with breathtaking action sequences and deeply resonant character arcs.

""Avengers: Infinity War"" excels in bringing together an ensemble cast of characters from different franchises within the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Each character is given their moment to shine, and the film skillfully juggles multiple storylines while maintaining a cohesive and engaging narrative. The interactions and chemistry between characters, both old and new, add depth and heart to the film, making it a true celebration of the MCU's rich tapestry.

Josh Brolin's portrayal of Thanos is a standout performance that elevates the film's antagonist to one of the most compelling and complex villains in superhero cinema. Brolin brings depth and nuance to the character, making Thanos a formidable force with a tragic and twisted rationale for his actions.

The action sequences in ""Infinity War"" are nothing short of spectacular. The film's epic battles are a visual feast, with breathtaking CGI, impressive choreography, and seamless integration of practical effects. These action sequences showcase the Avengers' powers and teamwork on an unprecedented scale, leaving audiences in awe of the superhero spectacle.

The film's emotional depth is one of its greatest strengths. ""Avengers: Infinity War"" delves into the sacrifices and consequences faced by our beloved heroes, making it an emotionally charged journey that challenges our perceptions of heroism and the cost of saving the universe.

Alan Silvestri's musical score is a powerful accompaniment to the film's emotional highs and lows, adding a sense of grandeur and gravity to key moments.

If there is any criticism, it's that the sheer number of characters and subplots may be overwhelming for some viewers, particularly those less familiar with the previous MCU films. However, this also demonstrates the ambitious scope of the film and its ability to bring together a decade of storytelling.

In conclusion, ""Avengers: Infinity War"" is an extraordinary superhero epic that delivers on every front. With its stellar cast, emotionally charged storytelling, and jaw-dropping action, the film stands as a testament to the culmination of the MCU's Phase Three. It leaves audiences yearning for more and sets the stage for an unforgettable conclusion in ""Avengers: Endgame."" For fans of superhero cinema and the MCU, ""Avengers: Infinity War"" is an absolute must-watch, and its impact on the genre cements its status as a modern cinematic triumph.",9
Fantastic,28 April 2018,"Avengers Infinity War brings you a fantastic mix of all the concepts you'd like to see in a superhero movie: an epic villain, amazingly coreographed fight scenes, death, balanced humor and sadness. I also want to say that VFX in this movie were the best i'd seen in a while. I love seeing the effort the team has put on the movie and with IW i can honestly say that everyone seems to have worked hard in their part. From the actors to the backstage team.I'd expect nothing less from Marvel studios and Russo Brothers. I loved every aspect of this movie. That ending left me as well as the entire theater speechless and wanting more. Perfect movie for a perfect series. Kudos to Russo Brothers for having so many superheroes in one movie and not messing it up.",10
A Must Watch,9 May 2018,I liked every minute of this movie and I'm looking forward to the next one! I did not regret spending money on a movie ticket. A must watch if you enjoyed watching the Avengers movies.,10
Mixing all Marvel-characters created a stupid movie,11 September 2018,,5
Awesome Movie,5 May 2018,"I just saw the movie two days ago. First I thought how could possible that Russo brothers could merged this number of heroes in one movie. The story and script is incredibly amazing. The rnd scene was quite impressive same as all Marvel Movies. I can't wait until i see the next part of this adventure next year. I thanx the director, producers and all cast who participate in this movie. One more thing. I don't think so the story of the avengers will end with part 2 of infinity war. There more to come. This thought stick to my mind few months ago.",10
Wow...,17 July 2019,,8
Wow. A Perfect Movie.,6 May 2018,"As close to a perfect movie that I have seen. The stellar mix of comedy and drama helped to pace this movie to where there were no parts that felt as if they dragged on too long. I would have given it a 10, but the special effects lacked in bits. It was expected but still a negative. Go see this. Seriously. The best payoff to a long buildup ever.",9
wonderful,23 April 2023,,8
"good, not as good as some mcus",22 February 2019,"Good, not as good as some mcus such as thor ragnorok, avengers1 and doctor strange.",8
A moving high intensity epic,26 April 2018,"Let's start with the scale: it's big. Te scope is unlike any.

Thanos is a fantastic and memorable villain and he is soon to become an iconic villain.

The humor is well balanced with the dramatic scenes and when this movie gets dark, it doesn't shy away of being really grim and even scary.

The stakes feel real. You never feel like anyone is safe when Thanos is on screen. Unlike the airport battle, every battle makes it seem like it might be the end of the Avengers.

It also ditches the typical structural formula Marvel likes to use and it's a pretty different experience thanks to it.

The action is very clear and well choreographed and i can not imagine this being directed by any other director other than the Russo brothers.

The CGI is really detailed and brings things to life. There are huge and beautiful cosmic landscapes to be enjoyed here. The obly aspect of the CGI that felt ""off"" was the Black Order's CGI, except for Ebony's.

Can not recomend it enough.",10
Wait.. What?!,20 May 2019,"A perfect set up for the Finale of the Marvel Universe. So many open Questions! I thought they did well in Story telling, with great CGI and an absolute amazing Villain. Loved to see all those Superheroes together!",9
Total disappointment,13 October 2018,"How to throw all storylines on one big heap, put them through a blender and see what's left. What is the point of this movie? Find out which characters are worth saving for the next installment? What a waste.",3
Not the Best!,7 May 2018,For me it wasn't worth the wait. Captain America : Civil War had a better story line. Infinity War was not my favorite Avengers movie but at least it was better than Justice League!!!!,8
Must Watch,8 January 2019,"Avengers: Infinity War ably juggles a dizzying array of MCU heroes in the fight against their gravest threat yet, and the result is a thrilling, emotionally resonant blockbuster that (mostly) realizes its gargantuan ambitions.",9
Beats The Dark Knight,2 May 2018,"My expectation were high about this movie going to the cinema. The result is, it may be the best superhero movie I've ever seen. The effort put in this movie is seen in every frame from the beginning. The script is very well thought through, every sentence feels legitimately polished and the humour in the movie is very pure, which makes it highly entertaining. There's a lot happening in the movie, but it's really easy to follow all the events as they happen in a really well fit pattern as everything comes together in the end.

Furthermore, I would say Thanos as a character amazed me the most. He has the most substantiate ideology I've ever seen in a superhero movie as he explains his point of views throughout the movie which made even myself ponder. His character overall makes him one of the best movie villain ever.

I went to see the movie with my girlfriend who hadn't ever seen a Marvel movie and had no interest in the Marvel Universe at all. As we watched the movie she was clung to her seat the entire time as she experienced all the emotions possible from the scale of sadness to rage. She was blown away as how good the movie is even more than me.

The film is for all the audience out there, not just for boys or people who fancy superhero movies. If you enjoy a good movie, I'm sure that this will exceed your every expectation. This is not just another superhero movie, this is THE superhero movie.",10
Intense!,26 February 2020,,10
Just an amazing cinematic experience!,27 April 2018,"Marvel does justice to all the huge expectations with Infinity War. Funny as hell at times and yet super serious, this one leaves fans exhilarated, overjoyed and yet exhausted and with a lot to process after a watch. The ending leaves you desperately craving for more superhero stuff. Needless to say, the wait for Avengers 4 is going to be a REALLY loooong one. It delivers on all the hype, and then some. This is seriously essential viewing for comic and non-comic fans alike.",9
Best Marvel movie until this date 2018,19 May 2018,"Consistence,logical and action .3 words to describe the most successful Marvel Universe movie",10
The Future makes it disappointing.,27 April 2018,,9
Didn't like it.,7 November 2018,"The movie failed to deliver he excitement and the entertainment that other marvel movies managed to do ,i guess gathering all the characters was a major fallacy within this movie, thanos's performance was a CGI made one didn't feel the malevolence and in his acting at all so much like steppenwolf they should've dwelled in his performance and emerge a new villain that will dominate the scenes, again they should've simultaneously put the superheroes and the villains alike in order to create balance in the plot nevertheless the movie was simply enjoyable but didn't deserve the hype he got.",3
Best marvel film I've seen in a while,28 July 2019,I think this film is the best film for the marvel fandom this film is dramatic action packed and has great characters and story this film does not deserve being this good and this is coming from a film that had all the potential for being a cluster flop and we as people should not deserve this film and this is the best superhero film since the dark knight,10
Hit all the right spots!,27 April 2018,"Just returned from the cinemas after catching the all new ""Avengers: Infinity War"" flick! And my oh my this installment was quite intriguing, all personalities and events in the film intertwining seamlessly into one cosmic universe and it was indeed incredible to witness and behold. Thanos as a villain is monstrous and intimidating with menacing disposition amongst an eloquent hyperbolic parlance. I found the mumbo jumbo regarding the nature of the universe rather mystical and quasi-Buddhist with subtle quantum overtones reminiscent of Oxford colleague chatter. The action doesn't disappoint either, with karate warrior-like combat scenes and mesmerizing space expeditionary incursions. The pace of the movie is never boring with plenty of funny comedic lines and dialogue. The integrating of all the characters from differing Marvel universes brought an eclectic vibration of diversity akin to a kind of balancing act of hormonal chemistry within the egocentric network. And good lord are Scarlet Witch and Gamora hot as fsck must I say. The element of realism and CGI prowess doesn't disappoint either.. Worlds and civilizations apart envisioning want of utopian resplendence and splendor. And The Hulk and Iron Man are f-in hilarious as toast rofl, with even each single Marvel character exuding a very vibrant distinct persona and aura in impressions formed. I of course to superlative extreme had fond appreciation for the whimsical substance and way in which the plot intrigue involving the omnipotence granting infinity stones followed through towards all of my five senses! All-in-all this movie was very captivating and entertaining indeed!",9
The Best Movie I've Ever Watched,18 March 2019,I can definitely say this is the best movie I've ever watched. I strongly recommend it.,10
Undeniable,19 May 2018,"I am supporting hashtag of #thanosdidnothingwrong. its confuse always me that avengers shouldnt have to fight with thanos because logically he is right and other side what about life that nature has taken too much time(almost billion years,from single cell to giants) to evolve and live.",8
Magnificent,5 May 2018,I was worried before watching it because I thought I had expected too much but it absolutely didn't let me down.,10
Visually Outstanding & Well Executed,18 February 2020,Avengers Infinity War was perfectly balanced as all things should be. But literally this picture is visually a masterpiece without doubt. Character arcs was well developt and the story/plot was amazingly good leaving us with shocking but outstanding cliffhanger. Russo Brother have once again accomplished a near impossible task to jam-pack dozens of superheroes into a 2hr40min film without any flaws. The humour was suprisngly on point and balanced the action and emotion. Overall this was a fitting predecessor for Avengers 4.,10
Very enjoyable movie,26 April 2018,"Waw what a great movie. Story is maybe not extremely elaborated but the special fx definitely are, without being ""over the top"" (like Transformers for instance). The only (very little) negative thing I found was the action scenes that were moving so fast that you couldn't see all the details of the shots. Just like there was too much blur on the images and you missed some things. But this is pure nagging, as said in my first sentence: stunning movie, very big recommendation.",9
its not really will break your heart and the final war looks stupid,4 August 2018,"Marvel again make hulk looks lame, and thanos pictured to be not really a villain at all, its different with the comic. his ideas is weak , they change it and not even mention the lady death at all.

the only interesting part is thor team, stark team is full of marvel stupid jokes, also the guardian being useless,

the ironman cgi suit is horrible , and thanos black order is a joke, marvel make them not scary at all. they put pop culture to make this movie more cringe!

also the final war looks stupid they called wakanda the must advanced technology country, but there is no heavy weapon at all, only a shield and stupid pew pew spear omg so stupid!

this movie is disaster.",4
Truly spectacular,28 April 2018,"This movie is not only the culmination of the MCU but answers our deepest questions. This movie is NOT an Avengers movie, but think of it more of a Thanos. Josh Brolin's portrayal of Thanos is truly amazing, in my opinion the best villian the MCU has ever scene. You will see layers of Thanos unfold throughout this movie, even the villain has much character development. This movie has so much to it. It is hilarious, epic, heartbreaking, you will cry out laughing, screaming, cheering, and crying. The ending to this movie is amazing and unpredictable, it will leave you shaken in seat and longing for the next one. I advise everyone to go and watch this masterpiece, because you will not be disappointed. (and remember to stay for the end credit scene)",10
Always wanting more,27 May 2018,Me and my fiance enjoyed every bit of the movie from start that is until the Finish. I guess maybe it would help if I would watch the ending credits as well as I have learned that Marvel has two significant points leading to the next movie. It left me Clueless and wondering but the effects were great jaw dropping impactful and yet job well done. As I tried to be a part of the cast I guess I was just part of the crowd watching as everyone else was left in suspense of what yet is to come I will recommend this movie Down the Line to others who haven't seen anything connected to or related to The Avengers.,9
Avengers: Infinite Success,17 April 2019,"Oh... my... god...

Pros;
For The sole reason of I'd be here all day; every single actor does an Incredible job. RDJ is fantastic, Hemsworth is fantastic, hell even Ned Leeds is fantastic and he has like 10 seconds of screen time!
Thanos is the new Darth Vader. He is menacing, determined but yet he is understandable and you almost want to side with the guy wanting to wipe out half life in the universe so good job Marvel!
Despite having the job of uniting 18 different movies of storytelling into one cohesive film, it works wonders! All characters feel right in the movie, you love all of them!


Cons;


Verdict; Whilst not entirely flawless, Avengers: Infinity War is a once in a lifetime experience. It has comedy, crying, crazy action and did I say crying? Can not wait til Endgame!",9
Bigger than any other MCU movie!!!,5 May 2018,,8
Team Thanos all day everyday,4 February 2019,"I love this movie, even though I know the endings are always leading to peace, love, and heroism, I can't help but side with the villain in this movie. I do believe his theory is correct. This world is overpopulated and needs a way over due cleansing. Team Thanos!!!!",10
Great movie,4 May 2018,Love this movie and love how everything seems so real and natural. Producers and actors did an amazing job.,10
That is worth to wait,27 April 2018,"It's remarkable, fantastic show what is Thanos quest about. Since the start of the very first Iron Man from 2008, all lead to this amazing movie.",9
Like watching a video game,7 June 2018,"Excellent visual effects, creative and artistic in 3D. Too many characters in this film with too many subplots. Many of the main superheroes have been stars in their own superhero films. Not much time spent with each one, but there were some entertaining, but brief, performances. Most of the film involved aliens and superheroes being either blown up or shot. Although I felt transported into outer space with the amazing visuals, the story seemed to never end and was predictable up until the ending. I think I saw 1,000 aliens get massacred in total. The ending stunk, a real let down.",4
Good but not great.,28 April 2018,Was actually bored during first 75 mins. Much better last 45 mins. Much of it seemed contrived.,8
A great effort!,27 April 2018,"Lengthy, but worth the watch. Packed with action and humour.",8
"Wow, just wow!",1 May 2018,"An epic film in many ways. I guess you'll need to have seen most of the MCU films of the last 10 years to completely follow the plot/story, there's action all the way through.

Many surprises to shock you, scenes that nearly left me in tears and made me laugh out loud. A proper emotion puller. Will add that whilst I've never read a comic, I could predict what the next avengers film will have in store due to the ending and lack of characters (hinted at in previous post credit scenes) which were missing from this. But my anticipation is at ""cannot wait level"".

The largest complement I can pay it, is that at nearly 3 hrs long, it still felt as though it was rushed and not quite as polished in flowing smoothly as say ragnarock, but I still felt It left me wanting more. Well done to everyone involved.",10
This Movie Was Awesome!! See It In The Theatre While You Still Can!!,13 May 2018,"I've never written a review before... But, I felt I should after watching this MASTERPIECE from Marvel!!! Short and Sweet - Movie was a fantastic ride from opening scene to end credits, I kid you not! PACE of this movie was perfect! It does not feel like Marvels longest movie to date.... Go See It In The Theatre While You Still Can!!!",10
My favourite movie,11 February 2019,,10
Superhero Wu-Tang Clan,13 November 2018,"If A$AP Mob and Pro Era joined together and became a new Wu-Tang Clan, that would be like this movie. The best thing about this movie is the sheer amount of superheroes that there are, and somehow it all works, and you get a good amount of screen time for (almost) everyone. The action is amazing, and the whole thing is great for comic book fans.",9
Must watch for MCU fans. One sitting isn't enough to see everything.,1 May 2018,"I can best describe this film as the ""SW Empire Strikes Back"" of the Marvel Comic Universe. Tons and tons of battle scenes on multiple fronts. Large military clashes on Wakanda, the city of the Black Panther. Other cities on earth are not spared either as the fights happens all over the globe and beyond. Yep, we get Superhero and Supervillian fist fights, sword fights and special powers fights on other worlds across the universe simultaneously. Even epic space battles. So much goes on the screen at once, you really must watch this film more than once to absorb it all. I cannot see the audience, especially those who are not well versed in the MCU narratives to pick up everything in just one sitting. For die heart comic book fan this movie is a must see.

The downside to it, in my opinion, the jokes weren't as funny as those in Thor Ragnarok or Deadpool . But this film as so much going for it, I did not mind that much.

The movie ends in a disastrous cliffhanger which will have audiences biting their nails for the next installment to this MCU franchise. If you go out to see it, stick around for the end credits because another scene for those patient enough to stay in their seats will be rewarded.",8
Pure unadulterated nonsense,30 April 2019,Could not sit through the movie. What a waste of time.,1

Worth the wait!,3 May 2018,,9
Best super hero movie so far,12 May 2018,"This movie has the right mixture of everything. i really enjoyed it . let me just talk about the down sides then. 1. too many heroes with less or no relevant dialogues 2. plot holes, why this and why not that. where did that go. where is this

i guess thats it then.",9
The Epic we were waiting for!,9 October 2018,,10
It deserves 9+,28 April 2018,"An amazing movie ,stunning .i felt that i watched 4 superhero high class movies at once... I'd rate it 9.5 only for 2 scenes...the scene thor activating the star was boring and unjustified... And the last seen of cap mourning vision had a very bad cgi specially with hulkbuster",10
Impressive Climax to the Marvel Cinematic Universe,8 September 2018,"That a movie like this is possible these days is a real feat in and of itself. Years of films and series content have built a rich cinematic universe spanning multiple independent threads and subplots, each with its own style and feel and tone, and full of rich characters both big and small. The character development alone makes this capstone film a culmination not just of a closely knit and well-maintained continuity, but evolution and deepening of the heros playing their parts. I would have thought something like this would be doomed to failure, being too big, too ambitious, too broad in scope and grand in vision to work. But, they did it.

Somehow it doesn't disapoint. The same actors reprising the same roles, all this time later, and those roles have not only blossomed in their own rights, but the dynamics between them as well. And now we are treated to new dynamics and chemistries. Seeing the likes of Star Lord on the same screen as Robert Downey Jr's Tony Stark was a particular treat, as was seeing the special kind of comedy that Thor and Drax both add to the screen, side by side. There was a lot of opportunity here for personality clashes and disharmony, but for the most part that doesn't happen.

There's also plenty of spectacle, given the huge amount of special effects and epic visuals, but the most adrenaline-prompting aspect of the film is the mere prospect of the contest we're finally witnessing. Seeing vastly powerful characters built up over all this time finally coming face-to-face with a villain who not only carries the sheer might, but the screen presence to truly match and best them. It's dark, but not as dark as the Dark Knight, nor anywhere near as cynical or gritty as Watchmen. It blends action, comedy, and all those carefully built inside jokes, relationships, and character quirks with a sweeping plot based on perhaps the best comic storyline of all time. It manages to be easy watching, but epic and deep, simultaneously. The Thanos we get on screen is the ultimate nihilist, and yet his character brings as much stark humanity as it does merciless destruction.

And the punches don't get pulled. We see beloved characters fall, break, and fail, and it's breathtaking because these are characters that if you've plowed your way through the MCU films have so much history and past behind them, and into which we've invested so much of our attention and consideration, if not affection.",8
Wasn't terrible but wasn't very good,29 April 2018,"The movie has a fair share of funny and great moments, however there were plenty of scenes that were plain stupid. The writing was fine. The acting was generally just ok, nothing special. the action scenes and cg were also decent but it was nothing really new or stylistic. I also found the plot and some of the motivations/ decisions made by characters to be stupid, but that's just a personal thing. Overall it was just a mix of good and bad, but with the bad slightly outweighing the good. therefore making it just below average for me. If I could, i would rate it a 4.5/10.

Also I feel like i should add, despite me not really enjoying the film, i can see why others did. This movie and if you enjoy it really comes down to the person watching it.",5
Amazing film,28 April 2018,,10

Avengers infinity War,29 April 2018,,10
All Roads Lead to this First Part and it Doesn't Disappoint,1 June 2022,"This is a movie that I've been waiting to show to Jaime. It is on the Internet Movie Databased Top 100 movies poster we are working through. We've watched all the Marvel Cinematic Universe movies to this point. This is my second watch and I warned her coming in that this is rough. Not in a bad way but knowing her it would mess with her emotions.

We pick up where the last one left off. Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and the people of Asgard are attacked on their ship that was fleeing. Bruce Banner is there, unable to change back into the Hulk. Loki (Tom Hiddleston) is also there. Thanos (Josh Brolin) is there looking for the tesseract as it is an infinity stone. He needs to collect them all to wipe out half of the cosmos, as he feels it is overpopulated.

This causes the Avengers, the Guardians of the Galaxy and all other superheroes to assemble. There is limited time and they're on the defensive against this much more powerful force. Decisions must be made, lives sacrificed, but it all pales to what happens if Thanos' plan succeeds.

My first watch of this was in the theater, at the Gateway Film Center. I originally powered through to catch this on the big screen. Coming back to it, I love the time and care put into the MCU. There are so many moving parts that come together. There are strained relationships, there are stakes in this movie. This also feels like The Empire Strikes Back with the focus so much on Thanos and the failures of stopping him. I'm usually a fan of the villain, so that works for me.

It is crazy to think of the budget that went into this movie. Almost every character is here. This is also a CGI-fest, but the money they put in looks good. Jaime also brought up that this feels like the individual movies of the characters we seen, but it seamlessly works. I agree there. Seeing these characters interact makes it enjoyable. My goal is to seek out the comic run that had this to see how different they are as well. This is one of the best in the series and I think that the MCU did an excellent job getting here. There is also heart and I'll be honest; I get sad in the end as well. I give credit to be able to do that.

My Rating: 9 out of 10.",9
WoW! But...final rating only after next part,5 May 2018,"Everything built up to this perfect end just right in every way. This whole duology should actually be 8 hours long (kidding...or am I?). Such magnificence and excellence in filmmaking should get every comic lovers full appreciation. Thank you Marvel, but as I promised my final rating will be after watching the final part, I have faith.",9
This isn't going to be popular!,1 May 2018,"As ever with movies, avoided all the hype before seeing Avengers Infinity War. Was rather surprised to see this scoring a 9 on imdb, so guessing my rating isn't going to be popular. I should probably say from the outset that I've never been a super fan of the super hero movies.

The plot to Infinity War is pretty much the plot to most super hero movies. The plot is overlooked in favour of lots of action sequences. Personally I don't find much empathy with any of the characters. With so many of the marvel characters on show it's hard not to wonder whether the screen time is being split evenly between the big names. Talking of which I also found myself wondering whether the Black Panther got more screen time in editing after the success of the recent movie.

There's no doubting that some of the visuals are dazzling. The jokes wear a bit thin after a while. If you love action movies and/or the marvel universe you will adore this film. It seems that many people who aren't must also love this film, so maybe it's just me that doesn't get it!",5

Best Superhero Movie Of All Time,28 April 2018,"Ever since July 2017, I've been anticipating this movie. Today, April 27th, I saw it. Every second of this movie had me completely shocked! Marvel is brilliant with every idea they come up with. Joe and Anthony Russo are so smart and they did everything the way it was supposed to be. This movie will leave you with many questions, but it will leave you wanting more. Not to mention, Thanos is the strongest villain the MCU has ever had. He's actually...Charismatic. Every single part of this movie made a Marvel fan gasp. It's THAT good. With every character that's been introduced in the MCU has a huge part in it. That's what I love about it.

"It's the Mad Titan's universe, and we are all just paying rent.",27 April 2018,"A towering achievement in modern day blockbuster storytelling, Infinity War hits hard right out of the gate, and continues to pummel you with spectacle beyond compare throughout its nearly three hour run time. While it's thrilling to see so many amazing characters meeting, and sharing the screen, make no mistake, this is very much a film about Thanos. Brolin's performance as the Mad Titan shines throughout the film. He is both bombastic and nuanced. Terrifying, and fallible. Thanos is now by far the MCU's most fantastic and interesting villain. Weaving together so many characters and storylines could easily have gone horribly wrong, but the Russo brothers navigate it seamlessly as they take us through the story, and from planet to planet at an almost break neck speed. It's no surprise that it's thrilling and hilarious to see Tony Stark interact with Doctor Strange, or Thor banter with Star Lord. Every character gets their moment and their chance to shine a bit(Spiderman and Doctor Strange were both standouts for me personally)even if that's all they get. Because the film never really slows down, you shouldn't expect a lot of character growth, or deep narrative arcs for any of our heroes. We've had eighteen films for that, and this is about seeing them all play and interact in this world together. This is an event film after all, and can really only be judged in the context of the MCU's entirety. There's no denying that Infinity War's greatest weakness is its assumption that you are very invested in these characters and storylines. So when I sit back to judge its quality as a film, I do so as a fan of the franchise and as someone who has seen all the films many times. Basically what I'm saying is there is no way for this film to really stand alone. If you haven't seen or didn't like most of the other MCU films, you will be very confused right from the start. In the end, this film absolutely belongs to Thanos, and we are all the better for it.

Grade: A-",9

"Funny, but too many plot holes",25 April 2018,"Without going in to spoilers, let it suffice to say that all the bad stuff that happens in this movie is caused by the repeating stupidity and selfishness of the main cast. Every marvel movie requires a certain level of suspension of disbelief, but in their latest with they had to drastically decrease the intelligence of all good guys to make it a 'fair' match for the bed gay (singular). There was no other way to work such a big cast probably.

The main redeeming factor is the extremely well done interaction between characters from different franchises and the jokes by themselves make the movie worth watching, just don't except anything from the story.",4
Dope film,4 April 2021,Good movie for sure. Loved it all. Very fun. Great watch.,9
There's not a word good enough to describe this movie,22 January 2019,"This movie is everything and more of what we fans waited for.

Marvel, you have done it again!",10
MCU's Biggest Movie Yet,30 December 2018,"As a big Marvel fan, this satisfied everything I could ever want out of an action movie. Josh Brolin did an incredible job playing Thanos and he became my favorite Marvel villain. I loved that we got to see all of the characters come together to fight Thanos in Marvels most epic battle yet. The jokes are funny, the actions sequences are intense and the characters all have their moments where they shine. The ending will leave you wanting more and very impatient to get it. Not only is it Marvel's best, but probably one of the best movies I've ever seen period.",10

Fully lives up to the hype,28 April 2018,"I need to start by saying this is a stunning movie. Great CGI, some really funny moments and a genuinely emotional ending.

With a movie so full of household names and established characters, I did wonder how Marvel would fit them all together and tell a solid story. They do both so very well with all the major characters of previous Marvel movies featuring heavily. Thanos was both Sinister and fearless with a few moments of weakness.

Great film, great cast and definitely needs to be watched at the cinema.",10

"""For now, I summon... the end"" ~Thanos",30 September 2018,"Spoiler Free review of Avengers: Infinity War.

A chef, famed for his art is threatened to make something he has never attempted before. With a gun to his head and the life of his family on the line, he kneads the dough in tears. What he creates is filled with heart and sorrow and is the best there will ever be. The chef and his family survive and should be celebrated for what they have achieved. Avengers: Infinity War is such a creation.

Thanos for me has become the most complex and the most passionately developed character since Dark Knight's Joker. Josh Brolin killed it, even though he was mostly CGI'd, his voice alone was an alarm for danger. Even with most of his backstory that would explain his motive is left out, you will still understand him. Some part of you will accept what he wants to achieve and you will respect him. He personifies the failure that you do not need but its inevitability makes you want to like his existence.

Every single character in this movie was devotedly given a purpose. Some succeed, some fail, but their efforts will give you goosebumps throughout the movie. Thor makes an entrance that was so cool that it almost made me tear-up with joy. The kid in my heart was alive and elated.

Marvel has created a formula that they so intricately yet mildly tweak every time that they end up creating something so diverse, it stands out on its own. However, Infinity War is a whole new ball game. It is unlike any other Marvel movie because it does what I like about DC and why I am a DC fan. It is DARK! It is dark, it is grim and it will fill your heart with anguish until it gives you the closure that you so desperately need at the end of the story.

I read comics and I have read infinity war in 2013 when it was released. I am glad that they are taking the Marvel Cinematic universe on a completely different tangent. This is nothing like the ""Infinity"" story arc and it is equally massive and entertaining.

The chemistry of all the characters is Marvelous (hehe). Seeing all powers work in unison is a sight to behold. Their resolve unbreakable, their masterful maneuvering seems beyond compare, only to be met by a God that keeps on consuming power. The unstoppable force met the immovable object here and the collision was as big as the universe and devastating yet beautiful.

I do not think it was possible to make the movie any better than it is. Infinity War is different and I loved it. The hardcore fan, the kid, the comic book geek, the movie buff will all drop their jaws in awe and will enjoy this to their heart's content.

It's going to get ""massiver!?"". The post-credit scene confirms that there will be Captain Marvel to intervene in part 2 of this Universal War. Captain Marvel is going to be played by Brie Larson (Oscar-winning actress for Room). Ms Marvel is confirmed by the writer to be the most powerful member of the Avengers so far. Can't wait!

10/10 will chew on my fingers along with the popcorn again.

I bought popcorn. In a theater. POPCORN! That's how good the movie is.",10
Best MCU movie so far,28 April 2018,"I loved this. This movie had everything what a awesome Marvel movie needs: menacing and excellent main villain, lots of interesting and likeable superheroes, amazing fight scenes and and great humour. This is easily the darkest Marvel movie so far and its shows very well throught out the runtime. Everyone gives excellent perfromance as usual.

Thanos is interesting and menacing villain and Josh Brolin did fantastic job as voicing him. The CGI for him was done really really well. His quest is to get all six infinity stones to his gauntlet and nothing is stopping him to achieve that goal.

Overall:

This doesnt get full 10/10 because there is little too much humour for this dark movie but I liked most of the jokes and I was having a blast watching this. I also think that not all superheroes got the chance to shine.

It will not be easy to wait the sequel.",9
Absolutely Loved it!!!,3 May 2020,,10
All good things must come to an end.,9 April 2021,"Finally! After binging the previous 18, I've reached what are indisputably the best of the Avengers movies.

And why are these last Avengers movies so great? Because they took the time to build the characters and worlds they inhabit over 10 years and 18 ... freaking ... movies.

The first Avengers movie impressed me mostly because of the fantastic job Joss Whedon did in bringing six larger than life characters together with the requisite tension and witty dialogue, while delivering non-stop action.

What the Russo brothers were able to achieve in Infinity War is frankly astounding. They did what the first Avengers movie did but with 21 of the main heroes which includes Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, Black Widow, Hulk, Vision, Scarlet Witch, War Machine, Falcon, Star-Lord, Rocket Raccoon, Groot, Gamora, Drax, Mantis, Nebula, Doctor Strange, Spider-Man, Winter Soldier, Black Panther, and Nick Fury.

This doesn't include the excellent supporting characters of Wong, Heimdall, Okoye, Shuri, M'Baku, Eitiri, and Maria Hill.

Every scene that brings these characters together, especially those that haven't met each other before (Iron Man and Doctor Strange, Thor and Star Lord, etc.), or those that haven't seen each other in a while (Captain America and Winter Soldier), gave me goosebumps. All the personalities from their respective films are the same (Drax is still hilarious: ""Die blanket of death!"" after getting smothered by Doctor Strange's cape).

Thanos is probably the best villain in the MCU, toppling Loki. Josh Brolin does a great job making him a brutal and mildly sympathetic villain.

And the number of locations they bring us to in all of its (4K HDR) glory is just insane: Earth (New York, Wakanda, etc.), Knowhere (Reality Stone), Vormir (Soul Stone), Zen-Whobiri (Gamora's home planet), Titan (Thanos' home planet), and Nidavellir (dwarven ""smith"" planet).

100% of the credit can't be given to the Russo's. The writing, producing, special effects, and frankly all the teams involved deserve huge kudos.

The finale is essentially the last hour of the film. While it helps to have a $350-$400 million budget, it takes a perfect storm of all these teams working to pull it off. Multi-location action and drama.

And the bitter ending after the snap. What really got to me here was T'Challa/Black Panther reaching out to Okoye and says ""This is no place to die"" then turns to dust. With Chadwick Boseman's passing that scene is just too real.

Just wow.",10
Great movie,3 May 2018,There's a bit of everything in this movie. Went to see it twice. It's great. Don't miss the post credit scene,10
Like *most* other MCU movies: Great CGI and plot mediocre,23 January 2019,"It didn't feel as epic as I thought it would.

Thanos - I couldn't take him that serious anymore after Star-Lord made a joke about him. Also his ambition was only briefly explained and didn't make a lot of sense.

The plot overall wasn't thought through very well (and yes, I know all previous MCU movies). Some things just seemed unlikely or like the easiest way to make the plot continue the way they wanted it to.

Not once I got emotional or felt surprised. Everything happened really fast and suddenly the movie was over.

In the end I just shrugged and thought 'Okay ?'. Also it wasn't clear to me why some of the known characters didn't use their powers and abilities to full potential and what the Infinity Stones, besides 2 of them, exactly do. Maybe it's just to tease us for following movies.",8
deserves first prize for lack of originality,23 January 2020,"There are not many critical reviews here, so I decided to shift the balance a little. I actually like super hero movies, but maybe they have outlived their novelty value. This is just a bunch of ridiculously costumed characters with a series of funny (not!) stereotype lines and a single character excuse for fight scenes. After half an hour of suffering I stopped watching.",1
Oh Snap,27 April 2018,"Marvel's Infinity War soars as it gives us what the franchise has promised ever since 2012's The Avengers. Out of all of this film's ambitions, the most impressive feat remains to be on delivering a Thanos that is menacing, intriguing, and astoundingly tragic. This leads to a film that is epic at its core, yet emotional and patient in its execution.

The standout of this film is arguably its main character, Thanos. It is through him that we see a villain that does not boast about how evil he is for the sake of being evil. He does not twirl his moustache and no longer sits idly on his chair basking at how destiny is at the palm of his hands. His pursuit and end goal in the film is portrayed as something noble. It is one that requires consequential sacrifices to be made and he believes that what he is doing is faultless and the right thing. He understands pain and loss and we see that throughout the film. He laments the countless lives he has lost and especially the things that he genuinely cares about. He believes that it is his burden to carry out his task of collecting the Infinity Stones and that he is the only one willing enough to save the Universe through his own means. He is the ultimate antithesis to the Avengers. It also surely helps that Josh Brolin's portrayal of him, even though mostly CGI, is one that shows an abundance of depth and a commanding presence to the character.

Meanwhile, it is made clear here that the Avengers exhibit themselves as those who happen to believe that even one life sacrificed is not a cost that they are willing to take. It is through them that Thanos reveals their goals as futile and short-sighted. This theme is hammered home even more by showing how ""Earth's Mightiest Heroes"" are still hopelessly divided through numerous planets and locations. Fresh from the events of Civil War, Tony and Steve are still not on speaking terms and the threat of galactic destruction could not have come in a more terrible time.

That doesn't mean that there aren't plenty of character dynamics that are absolutely brilliant. To name a few, Cumberbatch and Downey give phenomenal and unwavering performances that mostly pay-off the peril and torture that they've been expecting to arrive for years now through the destruction of life itself. Holland also gives a vulnerable and obviously young side to him even at the midst of the end of the world. Hemsworth shows off his acquired personality from Ragnarok, yet still shaken and jagged because of what's at stake. He shines as his role as the God of Thunder has never seen this much significance compared to prior outings. His interaction with the Guardians is the perfect bridging of both worlds that we knew was already coming sooner or later. Rocket and Groot are also given an unexpected role along with Thor that was fun and unique to watch. Speaking of the Guardians of the Galaxy, Gamora and Quill standout as their worried and broken past comes back to haunt them. Gamora particularly shines as the daughter of Thanos, which gives a sense of history and affliction for both characters. Each character drives home the grim and merciless danger that they are in. The stakes are still high and it is made clear for each sequence. Nonetheless, this is all not to say that this movie lost the usual Marvel trademarks of quips and lighthearted fun. It's still definitely an Avengers movie and how the characters organically and hilariously complement each other just makes their eventual collapse and downfall even more tragic and heartbreaking.

On a technical standpoint, the film is visually breathtaking and ups the scale to planets and worlds previously unimaginable. The blending of both the Guardians, the Avengers and Thanos himself breathes an entire universe into life and it feels lived in and familiar. The action scenes are definitely on point and take center stage in this film. The Russo brothers have learned a lot ever since they took the directing helm in Captain America: The Winter Soldier. The film presents the action as it is and does not opt in for shaky cams or obviously recognizable body doubles. They do not disappoint, aside from set pieces being a little too short lived as the film has to constantly go back to other side stories happening planets away. It's understandable as it has to juggle this huge ensemble of a cast that already had their own character developments and movies prior to this one. However, when a Lord of the Rings-esque battle is ensuing, it doesn't help when the film steps back from it to show a side story which we inevitably all know where it will lead it up to. Aside from that, other minor complaints are how the film's score shy away from using the individual themes to symbolize the heroic moments of their respective heroes. The Guardians of the Galaxy theme or the Spider-Man Homecoming theme are a few examples that are not present in the movie.

In the end, this film will leave you speechless, disturbed, and perturbed. It's something that Marvel has successfully made us feel after 10 years with most of these characters. It's a unique cinematic experience that any other franchise or movie comes close to nowadays. Infinity War essentially created a cultural phenomenon that will be discussed further in years to come.

The action was great and there were some very funny moments but these were quite jarring alongside the more heavy bits. It felt like the directors couldn't quite decide to wholeheartedly go comedy or serious and tried to do both.

I guess the only way to stop Marvel making these films is to actually stop going to see them but somehow I always think that the next one will be better. I'm always disappointed.",4

The villain Thanos, is great, fierce and is deservedly to be named the bets villain Marvel has offered. The accumulation of so many characters was magnificently executed and the plots and story line move in a way that even non-super fans of Marvel can understand. The heroes and heroins were given their best performances and the action sequences will surely makes you jump out of your seat with excitement and goose-bombs too. The jokes are on point however the movie was so emotionally invested and there are some sad moments that surely makes you drop tears like a baby and a lot of surprises to unpack. All a can say is Marvel Studios delivered what it promised and fans will be left with so many questions after watching the movie and hope the untitled Avengers 4 comes sooner than later. Good job Marvel Studios",10

Süper bir film,12 January 2019,Bu güne kadar izledigim marvel filimleri kadar güzel.,8
As good as it gets for its genre,17 May 2018,"A ""10"" for its genre, an ""8"" for a general movie, resulting in an overall ""9"".

Marvel studios somehow managed to give nearly all of its superheros in a single movie, yet get each of them adequate screen time. Without going into details, the plot involves the intent of extermining half the life in the universe by a villain who is arguably the greatest menace ever put on any superhero or fantasy film.

The CGI and action is great and although there is some comedy, this is a dark movie and the ending is the most shocking ending I have ever seen in a movie (it has a sequel due to be released next year) except for perhaps, the original Planet of the Apes movie.

Not a perfect film, but pretty close to it, especially considering the difficulty in interacting many characters.",9
A very bad written film man!,7 October 2019,It was very badly written. I just got out of the hall after the interval it was so bad lol!,1
Infinity Wow,27 April 2018,"10 years ago since there is the marvel cinematographic universe and 6 years ago we saw for the first time this great team of heroes who fight the battles that ordinary humans can not fight and today they achieved it with all the palmas, the movie directed by brothers Anthony and Joe Russo, it is spectacular, a visual and innovative delight that surely many generations will one day see with affection, there is not a single minute that you are not stuck to the screen looking at everything, something that spielberg made us do recently with ready player one, and that is really a very good movie that has drama, action, comedy but its balance makes it sensational and everything I could say about history, about characters, about who is the best actor serious spoiler and it is something that as an spectator you would not be able to do, but in spite of these compliments if you have your problems, maybe, without a doubt it is something that you can not miss and that you will enjoy a lot, it is very enida, very enjoyable but it is not epic ... but it was close",9
Avengers is War,27 April 2018,"What a Movie i didn't watch Like these type of Movie in My life. What SCREENPLAY, VFX, Editing, Everything all goes Awesome. Every Hero Intro will awesome. Climax also Awesome.

Waiting for SECOND PART

soon it will come",10
Eye popping spectacle.,27 December 2018,"Amazing movie making experience tying together all all of the various Avenger themed films into one, huge super hero adventure. It was kind of fun remembering which character was with which. The film is long, with some of the expostional dialogue dragging down the spectacular set pieces, but I still enjoyed it and the script has plenty of humour. In my mind Marvel still out weighs DC when it come to character development and story telling",9
Unbelievable,3 May 2018,"Can't believe that I cried to superheroes movies, one of the greatest movie of all time so farrr",10
It will please fans? Absolutely,28 April 2018,"Infinity War is one of the most unpredictable movies of the marvel cinematic universe (even when it has some predictable things) The movie is entertaining and funny, is an 149 minutes long, but it doesn't feel like it. The performances of all the actors is really good, but I had to highlight the performance of Josh Brolin as the villain, Thanos. The character is terrifying and you can feel that something could go terrible wrong when he´s on screen, he is the character that, to me, is the most interesting in the movie, and thetas really good, because a movie like this without a great villain could not be a good movie, and Brolin brings something additional to the character with his performance, even when the character is made by CGI, the performance is still very powerful, is like Andy Serkis as Caesar in the new Planet of the Apes movies. The visual effects are, of course amazing and makes what the best visual effects do, make you believe that what is on screen is real. Now, I have to speak about the negative points of the movie. First, it is a lot, the story tat they´re telling here could have been not a bit of a mess (like it is the movie) if they were telling it as a 10 episode series or something like that, but a movie can´t do that, so the result that we have on screen is a lot, and sometimes you can forget what some characters were doing at the beginning of the movie because they appear in minute 10 and the appear again on minute 40. Of course, everything that´s going on is important, but that problem makes you feel a little disconnected with some characters. Speaking about the characters, there were some that were really useless in the movie, and they were only there because they were introduced before. Stay for the scene after the credits, it is amazing, not like the one in Spiderman homecoming. In the end, infinity war will please fans and it will make them even more anxious for the next avengers movie. Watch out at the end, maybe you'll cry.",8
I didn't know how to feel about the ending.........,27 April 2018,"Avengers: Infinity Wars, is an epic saga from the Marvel Cinematic Universe, as the Avengers rebel against the existential threat that is the overwhelming might of the supreme Thanos The heroes of the narrative (Downey, Pratt, Johansson and the rest of the gang) are in excellent fighting form (as per usual) and bring undertones of organic humour (particularly Ruffalo and Holland) to balance the impending doom. Brolin's, Thanos is an infallible, and unmatched talent among previous Marvel Cinematic Universe villains. The leading antagonist (Brolin) could potentially challenge Heath Ledger's maniacal depiction of the Joker. This is not because Thanos is a megalomaniac and indomitable being, but his excellency lies rational. He is deft and absolute in both words and actions. He displays something inexplicably and hauntingly human about him. Thus, making him a fully realized anti-hero. Alan Silvestri's beautiful layered soundtrack heightens the emotional intensity of the Avengers greatest threat to date. His ability to capture the constantly changing tone and as the inextricably linked narrative jumps from place to place is deserving of praise. The Russo's Infinity Wars (Part 1) is sure to become a pop culture reference of the future, as they have managed to achieve with the Thanos and the Avengers what Bryan Singer failed to do with Apocalypse (a character of banal platitude) and the X-Men. But we are left with our appetites unsated, and waiting with both repressed clamour and bated breath for the conclusion of the enthralling and dynamic journey in 2019. -RJ",10
Just amazing,12 November 2018,Honestly one of the most entertaining movies ive ever watched in my life.,9
I was Bored,18 May 2018,,5
Worth watching,27 May 2018,"If you love Iron Man, Thor and Strange then you should watch this movie. The movie has some pretty good fight scenes with Thanos. Thanos lived up to the expectation of being top villain in the MCU. I really enjoyed this movie.",10
So intense,8 September 2018,One of the most intense movies I've ever seen. I was thoroughly engrossed with this movie and for me that is a rare thing.,10
Beside the film (better than than th hype!),30 April 2018,"How can people voting 1/10 be taken serious?? Even if you really hatted the movie, i don't see how can it be less than a 6/10.

For me, this film is better than all 18 MCU films that came before, and if you watched all of them (at least the avengers and one thor, captain america, iron man, guardians of the galaxy) you'll understand everything (plot, jokes, drama etc..). 9/10 (I put 10/10 to contrast with all the 1/10)",10
Exceeds Expectations to Infinity,4 May 2018,"Avergers: Infinity War is a culmination of Marvel Superheroes from the MCU, and this is by far, my favourite. The Russo brothers did a fantastic job of holding the audience's attention till the end credits and manged to provide a cliffhanger there too. It HAS lived up to the hype. The story, as most of you will know, is about the mightiest villain Thanos, who is invading planets from the existing universe in search of Infinity Stones, a set of extremely powerful gems which will help Thanos being all-powerful. It is up to the Avengers to protect them and if possible, take them from Thanos.

The action sequences: Larger than life will be an understatement. Watching in 3D is the most amazing experience one can have. Every time, the action offers something new. Every Marvel superhero has their signature style, with hyped features and fight sequences. It is a joy to watch that onscreen. But, Infinity War is not just about actions, it has emotions, and comedy sprinkled in too. That's what makes it stand out from the rest.

That being said, handling a movie with so many superheroes, which stretches for more than 2 hours, has not been divided proportionately. Iron Man and Dr.Strange get the lion's share, next is Thor and the Guardians. Hulk is a surprise and gem. Watch, you'll understand. Although, we hardly see Black Panther, Bucky Barnes, Falcon and Black Widow kick some villains, barring 1 scene. But, I'm still OK with it.

The ending left me like, ""I've to wait till 2019 now??""",9
This movie miss something,27 April 2019,I have watched it and feels like something more to have. I watched 2 time to understand the plot. So what is happening to it. Hopefully it will Releasing soon..,8
10 year build up. Did NOT disappoint!,27 April 2018,"SPOILER FREE REVIEW

Something that has always been lacking in a Marvel film was a good, solid villain. A villain we just loved to hate. Much like Joker for the DC universe. THANOS delivers! What a monster! What an evil, diabolical, powerful monster! The chaos he brings with him was something I have yet to experience in a Marvel film and I LOVED IT! I must give praise to the Russo Brothers for handling the balance of all these characters in this film in a way that Whedon succeeded in the first Avengers but failed to do in the Age of Ultron. Every character was crucial to the outcome. Balance is the key to the success of this film. It's what Thanos sought after and its what was executed perfectly in regards to the writing and directing of this film. The balance between humor and drama was spot on making the final 10 minutes that much more of a gut punch! I loved every single minute of this film! To have an event built up for 10 years and to be successfully executed is something to admire and awe over. Infinity War was simply perfect!",10

An extraordinary cinematic experience,27 April 2018,"I couldn't be more shocked by a movie. My heart was beating so fast from minute one until the last minute. My legs were shaking after leaving the theater. It is a thrilling ride with ups and downs (mostly downs). Many people say that it is exhausting because there are too many characters and too many things going on, but you cannot criticize this movie from this factor only. This is the movies nature. It was meant to be like that, to exhaust you until the last minute. On the other hand, there were too many characters but each and every one of them is shown equally with an enormous dynamic for all of them. Also, the scenes that were running simultaneously were masterfully crafted to fit in the story so that everything can end up the way it ended. Yes, there were many deaths and many of those deaths made us cry and made us emotionally unstable. But this is the movie, a movie about the possible end of the world. Thanos is the best villain that Marvel ever created. He threw Killmonger out of the window. We've seen an extraordinary part of his character. He is not the bad villain that everyone was waiting for. We've seen his good side in many perspectives, his only love. But we've seen what he is capable to do to accomplish his mission. At last what Avengers: Infinity War has that no other superhero movies has is that ending. Those 10 last minutes that will haunt you forever and you will never forget them. Things take an unexpected turn at those 10 last minutes that you are not only left speechless but you leave the theater with your mouth fully open from surprise and your legs shaking from disbelief. It's of course the first part of a two part movie because it leaves you with an enormous cliffhanger but let's not forget May 2019 is not too far away from now. Thus, this movie is a must see for all the marvel moviegoers and fans but also for people that have some knowledge on the movies background story. The cast and crew of this movie deserve a big applause and an enormous bravo from the entire world. I cannot believe that I've lived to see this movie. I quote what common sense media said ""This is the most intense, complex, and stirring Marvel Cinematic Universe film yet""",8
"AVENGERS, ASSEM-",27 April 2018,"This movie was an incredible spectacle and was a sight that I have been waiting to see for years! The characters were well balanced and so was the plot. Even though they used thick CGI, I still enjoyed and got used to it. The movie is a intense and thrilling ride all the way through and it definitely gave us all goosebumps to see our characters formed into something new and special. It's just that there is NO CLOSURE! Nothing. It's just not a typical superhero movie. We all knew this movie was going to be different, but we didn't know it was going to be a completely different type of superhero movie. Trust me nothing can prepare you for this.",9
My new favorite Marvel film and the best of the Avengers so far,26 October 2018,"I rented this movie after hearing so many good things about it from the Marvel fans. It took me a few months, but I finally got it. Lots of action and plenty of thrills. Plus those twists (I'll let you see the movie for yourself). And all the Avengers battling a common foe together. I'm hoping to see Avengers 4 next summer. Of all the Avengers films so far, this is my favorite. It's basically The Empire Strikes Back of the Marvel films.

PS: Stay after the credits to see a scene!",8
MY MOST FAVORITE FILM,10 September 2018,"I absolutely love this movie, it's something I have been craving to see ever since I was a little kid. Marvel shattered my expectations and to this day, it still makes me excited while sitting at the edge of my seat. Everything about this film is brilliant, there is no dull moment, and it'll keep you entertained through the entire running time!!",10
Everything we've waited for,27 April 2018,"10 years and 18 movies, we've waited and waited for our childhood fantasies to come to the big screen. This movie doesn't disappoint. In true marvel form, it gives us all the action and laughter we want, along with a wonderfully put together story. Bringing together this cast of well established characters was an awesome feat and done to perfection. Each character has their own set of little things that make them great and it was truely cinematic gold to watch these hero's meet one another. Action packed and edge of your seat adventure. There are surprises and cliffhangers and I'm sure Infinity Wars 2 will be just as entertaining.",10

Marvel Studios has done it right! Congratulations on your 10 & 19.,26 April 2018,"The 10 years of hard work, planning, and steadfast belief in their stories and movies have resulted in a catalog of superheroes movies that are not only entertaining, but resulting in a universe that has captured the imagination of the world. And Avengers: Infinity War is epic! It delivers on its promise and then some more surprises. For a movie of this scale, it does sacrifice some plot development for pacing, but those who have been watching the MCU are familiar with all the characters and storylines that have converged to IW. And so the story jumps right in to the events immediately following Thor: Ragnarok. Watching this movie on Wednesday morning 8.15am in IMAX, I was blown away by everything I saw onscreen, feeling like I was reading a comic book like a kid again. And that is the feeling Marvel movies have given me. Especially when I see all my favorite superhero characters coming together to fight Thanos. The Avengers were not prepared to fight such a powerful villain and because the Avengers have broken up after civil war, they lack the unity to make a strong defense against Thanos, giving him the upper hand. And when the closing credits rolled the audience were all silent and stunned, sitting in their seats for a end credits scene and then left quietly, probably going through the movie in their heads questioning what they had watched. There's even more questions now, but looking forward to Avengers 4 in 2019.",9
Really great movie,11 April 2021,,8
Everything the fans of the Marvel Universe could ask for!,26 April 2018,"So just why was it as I believe everything that we, the fans of the Marvel Universe could ask for, we finally got to see the separate bands of heroes work together and although it was inevitable, it was orchestrated that well that we would struggle to find issues with it.

Even looking at it from the view of your general film spectator it had all the key aspects you would look for in a great film from Comedy to a feeling of sadness towards characters (even thanos himself) as well as Action to Mystery.

With many critics and even fans thinking the series would struggle to sustain itself with it being such a large series of films thus far, Marvel have once again pulled it out of the bag to produce one of the best live action comic book movies of it's time.",10

Best Movie ever(possibly of all time),28 April 2018,Can you f$@ing mention a movie with 40+ characters yet still managing to succeed? Its infinity war. To the stupid haters out there. Why don't you direct a movie with 40+ characters in it? Let's see if you can do it. This is what makes you think that this movie is a complete masterpiece. A unique villain is a villain who thinks what they're doing I'm their perspective is the right thing just like what vulture and warmonger are.,8

"Do Not Listen To The Haters, It Does Live Up To It's Expectations",28 April 2018,"I've used IMDB since I knew what the internet was and I have never wrote a review until now.

This movie is THE movie we've (everyone who has been watching all the marvel movies) been waiting for. It's got action, comedy (They know when to do it), good story, good cgi, good heartfelt moments, good actors and best of all, a perfect villain. All the reviews with low scores are pure nonsense, 'Too many actions, too many superheroes, boring' Boring!? That's when I knew they written it just out of spite because probably everyone around them loved it and so they came here to hurt the score.

One review I could relate, it has so many superheroes that they weren't given a lot of time to actually shine on the movie. But what I really loved about this movie it's that is a Thanos movie, it's his story, the big bad buy who was pulling the strings from the shadows has finally emerge to the MCU and we get to see his life, his goals and how far he is willing to go for it. And that is why I could probably see some people dislike it but for me it was a good surprise. And the ending, if you seen every MCU movie then you would CERTAINLY NOT expect it. I always view the MCU movies playing it safe, I expected them to change their tactics on CA: Civil War but it was the same but on this one, well they actually went ahead and did it.

Keep in mind that this is a Part 1 and most likely they did it this way because of it. Now you know the villain, you know what he is capable of and what he did and that is the perfect plot for Part 2, making our superheroes whom we have come to know and love to unify one last time and shine together as the Avengers against a great made villain who actually lives up to his name, Mad Titan Thanos.

Overrall, you either love or hate the MCU movies. If you have never liked them, this won't interest you but if you have seen it since Iron Man 1 and have been waiting for Thanos since Avengers 1 then I promise you, YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED",10
A Complete Blast For MARVEL Fans!,27 April 2018,"Even though it's not perfect, I must say that AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR totally delivers all you want from a MARVEL movie. It gives you: the characters you love, the villain you've been waiting for and, of course the action sequences you've been craving like a fist-shaped bar of MARVEL-brand chocolate! We ALL should know by now that Joel and Anthony Russo+ MARVEL MCU= greatness and INFINITY WAR proves that fact yet again! Overall it's a pretty cool and fun ride, but you certainly have to prepare yourself for typical superhero silliness. However, the silly superhero stuff is told in a mature, non-patronising way and it wasn't like the rest of the of the frankly ""daft"" superhero films of the past year. Yes, I'm talking about you, THOR: RAGNAROK, SPIDER-MAN: HOMECOMING, BLACK PANTHER and GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY VOL 2. Though INFINITY WAR is certainly NOT realistic at all, it grips and has a serious tone that keeps you watching. The script is dynamic but also very funny in some parts and we get a good look at MOST of the characters. The plot is simple and nothing THAT new or fresh but it still grips and provides real closure on the already rather over-bloated MARVEL cinematic universe. There were a couple of elements I wasn't QUITE sure on but more about them later. Firstly, the good things: the plot, the characters and action.

The plot for the most part was really exciting and really had me gripped; it was serious and tense. However, it WAS a little dull in some parts. There were a few times when things lagged for a while but on a whole I was never really bored during this film. The main thing I was concerned about in this film was the amount of additional characters and how the film could easily become convoluted. Here's the thing: it didn't feel convoluted BUT, some of the characters do get sidelined. Some of your favourites like Captain America, Black Widow and Black Panther were kind of pushed out into the background and though they featured, they didn't feature as much as some (and me) would have liked. The story really focuses on three sectors: Thanos, Team Iron Man and Team Guardians. Everything else is really not that major. Now, on to the action. The action in this film was quite frankly AWESOME! After all, these are the directors behind the elevator and airport fight scenes in the Captain America films 2 and 3. The battle for Wakanda plays out like a completely OTT version of the battle of the Pelennor Fields from LOTR 3 and once the infamous AVENGERS score kicks in, you know you've got a good thing going!

Now, on to the acting! Almost ALL the members of the cast are great and give it their all! Some of these characters may not get all that much to say but they're all well-acted. However, I REALLY wasn't sure about the movie's main villain Thanos (Josh Brolin). I must admit I found Thanos (as a character) rather bland. You certainly realise what a threat he poses to the Avengers but really, he's a purple Darth Vader who's not THAT interesting. Brolin's performance is strong as the genocidal maniac but there were times when Brolin simply read the script. Though the villain is something new, I don't see him as a cinematic villain that will stand out!

On a whole, the film was fun, action-packed and gripping but it's nothing REALLY new and as my Dad so rightly said: ""once you've seen one; you've seen them all!"" The conclusion was devastating and raised many, many questions and the after-credits scene was certainly interesting even though it wasn't really worth waiting for. Definitely a fun ride but I couldn't really say that ""this... Does bring a smile to my face""...",8

Wasted time,5 August 2018,"2.29 hrs are simply wasted. i dont know why some people telling lies about that crap , and try to proving that its an awesome movie... iam just talking to those people who planning to watch avengers infinty war, save your 2.29 hrs and spend them some other good things.. dont waste your 2.29 hrs on that crap...",5
A Marvel film that hits all the emotions,22 January 2019,"After 10 years of the current era of the Marvel universe, 'Avengers: Infinity War' marks the beginning of the end for the stories of many of the characters we've grown attached to throughout multiple film entries. What else can you expect but a gargantuan cast that brings together nearly every single major superhero and supporting character?

It's difficult to keep track of everyone in 'Infinity,' as different factions team up with each other, whether it's the 'Guardians of the Galaxy' crew splitting up with the likes of Thor and Doctor Strange or members of the original Avengers crew heading to Wakanda for a last stand of sorts to protect an infinity stone, everything is all over the map. But regardless of where our heroes are physically in the universe, they are united in their mission to defeat big bad guy Thanos before he can wipe out 50% of all living things in the universe.

Despite the obvious bloating that 'Infinity' experiences, the film works very well. It feels as grand as it's billed, and lives up to the hype. There's plenty of material here, from the stylized action sequences we come to expect from Marvel fare to humorous banter between the old friends - and some new ones - when everyone crosses paths. In this sense, 'Infinity' feels more like a space opera than it does your typical superhero blockbuster. There's also an ominous tone that 'Infinity' takes on as it becomes clear that the situation is dire, and it's a hard pill to swallow when events transpire, including the final moments of the film that leave many breathless. One of the few criticisms of the film is that it moves too quickly - the story could have unfolded much better as a Netflix series, but of course the filmmakers did what was necessary to get it to an appropriate runtime.

The Russo brothers deserve much credit for being able to tame this beast of a movie, and it's likely that 'Avengers: Endgame' will be a must see when it hits theaters in April.",8
Go watch it.,31 May 2018,"Wow just Wow. This Movie is a blast. From start to the end. For me easily the best marvel movie so far. Also Thanos is simply incredible. Badass, but sometimes also a being with feelings. Best villain so far.

This Movie is so good, don't know how they want to top it with Avengers 4. The expectations are incredibly high.

Dont understand some critics here. There must be not more explanation in this movie. Every marvel movie lead to this point. Every marvel movie till now explaint more than enough for everything.

For me perfect movie, but i cant wait for the next part.",10
"Okay, what can I say here?",21 May 2018,"There is so much that you can say about this film. The problem is, that would mean I would have to include spoilers, and I don't want to do that. Although, I'm sure many people have seen the memes before watching it, like myself, but even I was surprised by some parts. Anyway, here I go.

The day before watching Infinity War, I watched the first Marvel movie ever made: Iron Man. I wanted to see the amount of changed between the first movie with the nineteenth in the series. First, Iron Man alone is a great film, but you can still notice the problems. When watching Infinity War, it is like a work of art. Every camera captures the emotions of every character, and we even see character depth in Thanos (will not say where in film because that would be a huge spoiler for anyone who has not seen the film). It brings back everything from the movies in the past, from Civil War, Winter Soldier, The Avengers, Age of Ultron, and multiple others.

In other words, watch the film. There is nothing I see wrong with it, and the end will most likely make you tear up.",9

"Never has the ""Marvel Cinematic Universe"" seemed like more of a universe",16 October 2018,"The insubstantiality of the film isn't due to the infinite yet flimsy malleability of C.G.I. gimmickry but, instead, to the dispersion of its drama throughout the many cinematic installations set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.",8

Avengers forever!,19 May 2018,"There is plenty to celebrate. Today, releasing its nineteenth movie, the multibillion-dollar American film production company Marvel Studios not only celebrates a decade of glories since the unsuspected inauguration of cinematic universes with ""Iron Man"" by Jon Favreau, time in which, of course, it reaps trillions of dollars for The Walt Disney Company; but also celebrates that its heroes, idealizations of human beings, have become effigies for thousands of kids and grown-ups; celebrates film and comic with passion thanks to remarkable artists who have materialized fictions in the eyes of a humankind in the depths of despair; celebrates life through real feelings packed in gorgeous bags; celebrates it's got an imperishable place in the Popular Culture of the 21st century; celebrates emotional beauty and the complexity of emotions in a shattered viewer who watches; celebrates the endless praises and universal acclaim has obtained with each entry, with every mistake, with every success; celebrates the establishment of a brand that seemed dead in the history of modern cinema- yes, the post-credits scene; -celebrates, at the expense of its interconnected stories, another important establishment in mainstream movies: too many easter-eggs; celebrates the influence that its heroes have caused in the minds of many people; celebrates the start of a grand finale, one more phase, which actually means three phases of triumphs and falls; celebrates that they have built the unimaginable: reaping the fruits of an idea that at first all dismissed - especially production studios, - the fruits that, while represent in monetary gain, also represent a deep-rooted pride of reviving the golden age of comic-film adaptations, building multiverses with more pros than cons where fearless charisma, white humor, feelings, passion, PG-13 ratings and audiovisual high-quality were capital rules in the conception and subsequent production of live-action stories printed in paper; but above all, it celebrates something that is honestly unusual currently: to make cinema, good cinema, human, ambitious, inspiring, diverse cinema with disproportionate amounts as a budget, brilliant. Today, we must wear our most elegant clothes because a long way is coming to an end, a painful, exciting and hopeful end; it won't go away for keeps- never mind - but what we know as Marvel is fading away: marvelous talents, marvelous characters, marvelous messages, marvelous enlightened dreams, marvelous cinema.

No one can argue Marvel Studios is its heroic headliners, on this occasion, many flaunt their most peculiar and politically correct personalities. I'm not a fervent comic-factory fanboy, you must win that honor with great effort, I'm simply hypnotized by the magic of cinema, I have followed closely the house of ideas' adaptations for more than three years and, like the fans, I've fallen in love with all its adventures, from the serious-themed ones to the most eccentrically amusing, for that reason, I was afraid of what Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, creators of the script, have conceived, holding in their hands so many options to choose from, hands down, these gentlemen have written a drop-dead gorgeous blockbuster. Always leaning heavily on the comics by Jack Kirby and Stan Lee, the most loyal screenwriters of the company get the most out of the mind-bending work weaved by dozens of creative minds over ten years in order to conjure up a praiseworthy ending, made up with the requirements demanded by the buffs but without neglecting the narrative needs of the story, setting up a next-to-last crowd-pleasing thrill-ride of a movie, that reminds a lot of a real Greek tragedy, a hard time. An unspeakable glee emerges when you watch your most loved characters popping up with each new scene, a feeling strengthened by seeing them relating each other, especially those dudes who didn't even know the existence their ""friends from work"" and those who share similar ways of being, where a funny leadership struggle comes up. It can be said that this titanic adventure is narrated by means of three channels, working simultaneously through three different acting ensembles, in order to synchronize the argumentative axis with the superheroe triplet in the end, each of them executing a very important role; it's unbelievable to break down every detail and realize that even the ""least important"" character gets his moment of glory -although, surely, certain men will lose a huge portion of his legion of followers with their actions. Obviously, it doesn't forget the characteristic comedy pack of the company, not always so positive, it breathes the well-known 'Marvel Formula', each hero bathes its own narrative purpose, particularly in the first two acts, with the typical quips, there are many push-lines as comical as dramatic, each one has the chance to shine on screen as they open the way to others, a material in which nothing, absolutely nothing is put at random. Amalgamating more than 70 now-famous familiar characters in a coherent, kinetic and empirical mold is already an arduous task, which is much harder if, like Star Wars' one-billion-dollar flicks, planets and dreamscapes, villains and additional ideas are integrated organized by the screenwriters.

The pictures take advantage of the photogenic faces and the nostalgia coming from each character to place them in the middle of dreamy landscapes which can be scenarios of massacres or simple backgrounds to development scenes. The colors are essential in the scenes, the three groups of superheroes are assigned a different tonality according to the timing handled by every hero; the visual settings expel quality setting spectacular artistic feats, either outside or inside the planet Earth. The set-pieces, that onerous, but risky action sequences are embellished to the max by the excellent, in capital letter, score of Alan Silvestri, with only two not-original songs made for the composer (a couple surprises of yesteryear and Wakanda). The emotional scope of the clamorous and poignant melodies composed by Silvestri is impressive, a potential Oscar 2019 contender for Marvel. If you close your eyes and play the work of the ""Forrest Gump"" composer would emerge the same sensations that if you were contemplating the beautiful pictures, but, what's really beautifully intoxicating is to couple sound and image, making us go through the best, but also through the worst. Trent Opalochy's cinematography and the effort of all creative departments - I'm stunned to see the number of people involved in the production - make it possible that, although the film doesn't become into an instant superhero classic, manages to leave on our minds a good amount of dramatic and action sequences that make history, cinema history, they make your heart beat to the rhythm of the emotion, they make you imagine that you're in the fight, they make you understand why film is life. There's grandiloquence every which way, but here it's not a mere and bombastic accessory, every sequence fits with the script to give verve and impact to every turn the story takes, exhibiting a box of useful angles and camera movements that move away from any superhero-genre cliché, they are exquisitely built thanks to the truly special high-octane special effects - overlooking every other slip-up.- Any perceptible visual flaw must be forgiven due to the complexity this film encloses; at least in the visual and, therefore, artistic field, it's in the top 3 of the best superhero films in film history, just one more record.

""Avengers: Infinity War"" by Anthony Russo and Joe Russo won't be an expressly idyllic experience for many viewers, what is more, it seems that the mega-event set up by the spoiled brothers of Marvel has switched the game and instead of filling it with nondescript pyrotechnics and visual gags, they morph the accustomed action superhero film into a drama of unthinkable reaches, standing out by the seriousness, coherence, and severity of a script that knows how to use their strengths through characters brimming with soul, personality, and powerful messages. The film veers when it pleases, and although doesn't do it precisely in the best way sometimes, it hits the spot in almost every aspect, causing a really disarming effect, when the credits rolling down, you're still in your seat, speechless, depressed, shocked; no doubt, no superhero film had achieved it to date. Disney's subsidiary company is not jealous of the dark and pessimistic tone of DC, as it has created its own tone with much more deadly consequences than the Warner Bros company's flicks. The first shared universe in cinema history has been manufactured by artists who after long working hours have relegated time with their families to bring happiness to others through adaptations which are etching in our memories. How many kids scamper with Captain America shields in their heads or Iron Man scarlet armors? Ten years of stories as proof of a work full of sacrifices, ups, and downs, But today, after such a long time, the time has come to say thank you, thank you for having transformed present-day cinema, for better or worse. Just like J.J. Abrams' 2015 space opera ""The Force Awakens,"" a new movie-event takes place this year, ""Infinity War,"" the first part of a grim farewell, shakes our senses, its heartbreaking movements deliver a matchless adventure and its strong impact will affect the spectators for much longer, a must-watch. Watching the final scenes is hard task because your eyes are full of tears, that's a faithful sign of what kind of film it is; A motion picture as entertaining as melancholic that shows Marvel's love for his creations and that serves as a very complex turning point leading up to what will mean the closure of a golden superhero century.",8

Marvel does It Again!,29 May 2018,Avengers: Infinity War is a type of movie that is great in the sense that it brings together all of our favourite superheroes but is bad in the sense that it ends with the audience waiting to see part two.

Would have rathered not hearing the nonsense of Ragnarok to start with, especially if it ultimately comes undone.

Superhero nerd candy,16 May 2018,"A delightfully nerdy mash-up that is a kitchen sink of genres. It had all the major players in the MCU to date, but they were still able to balance things out and avoid it feeling too busy / crowded. Incorporated themes that cut across time, space, death, and reality. The story kept me on the edge of my seat right up until the end. Not since 'Wrath of Khan' has a movie left me with a feeling of ""Holy crap, what are they going to do next!"" Must-see.",9
Are you Ready?,27 April 2018,"Many years have passed and many films have come until this time comes. Did it deserve it? For sure. AIW is not the perfect movie, but it's definitely in the highlights and Top 3 of Marvel's Cinema Universe. Russo found the right trick to harmoniously distribute the film between 23 characters and a titanic evil, with beautiful visual effects (more than 10 studios worked on them), stunning action, humorous moments, emotion and a story that keeps you interested.

Exceeds Trailer and Hype,28 April 2018,"Trailers are meant to make you want to see a film and showcase some of the best moments of a movie to draw your attention. Knowing that trailers are meant to do all of that, it has been a very long time since a movie has been 100x better than the trailer but Infinity War was just that. I was worried the film would feel rushed and generic with forced cameos but I was dead wrong. This was by far the best superhero film I have ever seen. I laughed, cried, and left the theater thinking ""what the hell just happened""? I highly recommend anyone with the slightest love for Marvel to see this movie. You will not regret it!",10
MARVEL 10 YEARS: The beginning of the end!,27 April 2018,"Once again, Marvel surprises. With this film, she was able to demonstrate that her 10 years producing films have resulted in a FANTASTIC MOVIE, SPECTACULAR IN ALL SENSES.

To begin with, the work of the Russo Brothers and the writers themselves is impressive, the work the writers had to adapt a comic to a movie, so that everything works beautifully. It is simply spectacular. The work of the directors is also and was very important to transmit the script to the screen and it was made in a way that the scenes are beautiful, the camera movements are very good. The picture in this movie is beautiful.

In my opinion, the best work in the MCU from The Russo Brothers.

The soundtrack, to me, is one of the best and most striking of the Avengers films, and every use they give it, is spectacular.

Leaving the technical details, the writers have created such a good script, that each character has its moment to shine, even for a short time, from extras to the main characters.

In question to the villain, it is without a doubt, the best villain MCU ever had, is a villain with a purpose, but although it has these goals, is a humanized villain thanks to the script. That is, we understand his goals and feel anger, agony and pity for it. The tone of the film is different from the other films, a little bit more darker than the last Russo Brothers' movies, but that dark tone has a purpose, it is used to exalt the villain.

And for those who are worried about humor, I just say this, it is well mixed with the action and has its due moments.",10
Why some people hate this movie?,1 May 2018,"Avengers: Infinity War is a climax of all 18 movies completed over a past decade. People hate this film is probably 1) Do not watch those 18 MARVEL MOVIES or forgotten their story lines (go home and re watch). 2) Too much real expectation (This is a comic book movie so it is not real). 3) Upset about plot holes and big cliffhanger (of course, there will be Avengers 4, so be patient and just accept the movie as it is). 4) They are not superhero stories fan (please find another movie that suits your favorite).

As a movie fan, I am glad that alive until today to see these years of masterpieces together, well organized and well played, although there are so many characters and plots to put in a 2 and half hours movie. I felt that this movie need more time like three hours, to see more the beauty of its story line. However, to see another Avenger movie on next year for knowing how the story will unfold is the best thing ever in my life.",9
This movie contains lasers and bubbles,9 March 2019,"Perfectly balanced, as all things should be. This movie keeps what the mcu have been promising for years.",10
Couldn't sleep,28 April 2018,Loved the movie. I should not have gone to the late show. I. Was. Not. Ready.... I was up until nearly 3 am Googling stuff. I just need part 2 to happen like tomorrow!,10
Better then overrated endgame,13 August 2019,"Infinity war had the best cgi in a movie ever,it felt so much like a thanos movie and will forever be a classic it was the biggest crossover in history to date, its deserving of its 8.5 score but should be higher the endgame thanos was such a well developed villain that felt more like the hero his CGI was unbelievable everything from the veins to the hairs thanos is the best CGI character I've seen",1
Best marvel movie that isnt winter soldier,23 August 2019,,10
A Marvel Film That Is Perfectly Balanced As It Should be,28 April 2018,"Avengers: Infinity War is the nineteenth film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and is directed by Anthony and Joe Russo. The film follows Thanos on his quest for all six of the infinity stones in efforts to wipe out half of the universe. As he tries to complete his quest, the Avengers and Guardians of the Galaxy band together to stop him from completing this quest.

Like most films do, Avengers: Infinity War establishes what kind of film it will be right in the first scene. The film establishes the emotion, action, humor, and the intense villain. As the film progresses none of this ever lets up and we get the most exhilarating Marvel experience to date.

The Russo brothers orchestrate this film masterfully. They were able to juggle all the characters in one film, in ways that are certainly welcomed and unexpected. They did this by taking certain heroes and grouping them off with other heroes as they try to achieve different goals throughout the course of the film. While the Russo brothers manage to juggle all these characters, they also manage to bring out the best aspects of these heroes and their previous films. This strikes a perfect balance in the film of emotional, humorous, and action-packed moments. As the film shifts focus to each group of heroes, these moments compliment each other, making for the smoothest pacing we have seen in a Marvel film. This is due to the Russo brothers bringing along other directors from previous MCU films to executively produce the film. However, the perfect balance does not stop at the heroes, as we get a great story for Thanos as well.

Not only is Thanos the most intense MCU villain, but he is the best MCU villain to date. Josh Brolin gives an excellent performance that establishes his character as an intimidating one, where the stakes feel like they are actually against our favorite heroes. Brolin's character is also the best-written villain in the MCU. As our favorite heroes try to achieve their goals, Thanos sets out and tries to achieve his own. Thanos gets the most screen time out of any villain in the MCU and his story give us insight and depth into his character. Thanos isn't trying to destroy half of humanity for the sake of destroying half of humanity. His well-written character arc shows us that he has emotion and a reason for his madness. This is the first MCU film where the story feels like it is equally told through the lens of the heroes and the villain, making for the greatest Marvel villain to date.

I can't say much without spoiling the film, but the Russo brothers manage to find a perfect balance in all of our favorite heroes while giving us the best Marvel villain to date. This makes the culmination of ten years in the MCU feel well worth the wait. This is not only the best Marvel experience I have had but one of the best cinematic experiences I have ever had. Don't miss what could certainly be the film event of the summer and possibly the year. My score: 9.75/10",8
"""Avengers: Infinity War"" Review: A War to Marvel Over",19 May 2018,"Where is the ""Infinity War"" review? What is an ""Infinity War"" review? I got one better...WHY is ""Infinity War"" review?.....okay that was a stupid reference.

""Avengers: Infinity War"" gives fans the quality battles and banter they were expecting out of Marvel's biggest comic hero mash-up yet, but also takes things to a new high with a bold ending and providing the best MCU villain to date.

Following the breakup of the Avengers, the Earth and the entire universe is finally the target in the crosshairs of an alien war lord named Thanos, who seeks to collect all six infinity stones so that he can gain the power to exterminate half the population of the universe at the snap of a finger...literally. To take on this threat, not only do the Avengers have to get along with each other again, but team up with the Guardians of the Galaxy to save the day. But can they?

This film is basically review-proof. You can barely talk about anything because just about anything would be considered a spoiler. Thanos plays an Easter egg hunt for 6 glowing power rocks and our heroes, broken into various parties, try to stop him from doing so. The film wastes no time getting to the point and never really has a moment where the film tones down its breakneck pace. Even in dramatic moments the film never drags on too long with any obstacle. Clocking in at 2 hours and 40 minutes, the film never feels its length.

Character interaction was arguably the highlight of the original ""Avengers"" from 2012 and that is, even more, the case with ""Infinity War"". The new characters added to the Marvel roster are now thrown into the mix and the filmmakers clearly did their homework to make the sure the right individuals were mixed together to maximize the comedic effect. The best example of this is the mix of Thor and the Guardians. If someone back in 2008 would have coined the idea of paring the God of Thunder with a smart mouthing space raccoon (or rabbit if you ask Thor), reasonably the almighty film judges would have thrown the screen booking right at them without hesitation. However, to no one in 2018's surprise the combo works better than one could have dreamed. Then there is the matching of Iron Man (power by science) with Doctor Strange (power by magic). The more Strange appears in films the more I want another Doctor Strange solo film. Except with a good villain next time.

Speaking of good villains, that has been a notorious issue with Marvel films. At best, the antagonists are just fine and get the job done, but rarely has there been a villain who steals the show or really proves to be much of a threat. Black Panther more or less yanked the chain along with Guardians 2 and Spiderman: Homecoming. Now comes ""Infinity War"" with Thanos to break the chain. Just in the opening scene alone, the film establishes Thanos as a legitimate threat to our heroes. Not only is he a well presented threat, but he is also a well-defined character. Josh Brolin, who is basically good in everything, provides such a good performance that you almost start to reason with his character's plight...even if genocide is a part of the equation of it all. This really is his film in the end.

On the matter of ""ends"", the climax of this film is a new definition of daring not only to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but superhero films in general. I can't say what occurs, but needless to say, it will be interesting to see how they go about following it up. Remember, even though ""Part I"" isn't in the title, this is a two-part story that ends in a cliffhanger.

There are no real negatives to speak of here. I personally still put ""Civil War"" as the best of the MCU. I felt that film handled complex social issues and political differences in an interesting way and for me, watching heroes go against each other is more tragic then fighting another common enemy. I also felt the action had more interesting choreography. The battles are well handled in ""Infinity War""... it is a war film after all...kind of in the title. Still, there wasn't really an ""airport scene"" or ""omg Cap and Iron Man are fighting"" scene. The action is grand, but it's not necessarily one of ""Infinity War's"" highlights in my opinion.

Still, it is very impressive when the highlight of a superhero film is the dramatic moments and not the action. ""Infinity War"" provides a quality dosage of both and should be more than enough to keep the core audience healthy and hungry for the next chapter in the MCU.",9
The Unusual Superhero Movie,17 May 2018,,10
I loved it,27 April 2018,Absolutely an amazing experience! The movie has been filmed awesomely around the presumed storyline. It evokes mixed emotions and is capable of holding you still for the time it runs. This masterpiece is certainly the result of hard work of every single individual named in the cast and credits.,10
Go > Watch > Enjoy > Applaud = Infinity War,28 April 2018,"MCU introduced this movie as the dream project and YES!! this movie is bent on target. BINGO..!! If you have been a Marvel student since IRONMAN until Black Panther you are gonna love this movie. It is really remarkable how the Avengers and their Space allies are brought together as one team against THANOS. The script looks a bit loose but the dialogues will thrill you for sure. The screenplay, background score and the visual effects are fascinating. Regarding the characters, you are going to love the appearance of your favorite superhero but THOR and CAPTAIN AMERICA steals all the charisma, specially the intro scenes of Captain America. Chris Evans looks are eye-catching and he is looking stunning. Thor again emerges as the most powerful Avenger. Tony Starks aka Ironman aka Robert Downey Jr. has been cool as ever with his new suit and Dr. Strange, Gamora, Vision, Starlord, Black Widow,SPIDERMAN, Wanda Maxinoff and so many others looks justifying with their roles. I will recommend viewers to visit the cinemas near you, watch the movie and enjoy the funride. But... but.. hold your nerves a bit tight as we are gonna loose some heros.. The heros you might love and admire..... Thank You!!",8
My favorite,7 January 2020,"My favorite of all time. Terrific action and in depth in all it's characters. This film should be recognized more for it's theatrical achievements and not only it's monetary ones.

Best Comic Book Movie Ever,3 May 2018,,10
AMAZING STUFF,30 April 2018,"I don't normally write in to comment on any movie or anything else in general,even if something vexes me, I usually just like to read other peoples comments and then either smile or huff and puff.I will say I am a great fan of Marvel Studios and have seen all the current movies right back to Iron Man at the pictures,I also like many others own them all on disc to watch over and over again,which I am currently doing.I even remember seeing Ang Lees HULK at the flicks,and Ben Afflecks starrer Daredevil,(though not Marvel Studios then),both of which at the time I quite liked.However we are in a whole new ball game now,with each new Marvel film hitting new heights of what is possilble on screen.I saw Infinity War ,the day it came out I couldn't wait,and I enjoyed it ,it never dragged not for a long film,but in my opinion and it is only my opinion,I did not enjoy it as much as I thought I would or as much as say Avengers Assemble,or the other Russo brothers films Captain America (Winter Soldier) or Civil War,and I don't really know why,the acting was all top notch as usual ,the SFX excellent,the banter and script all in place,Brolins Thanos never anything other than gripping and believable.It just didn't gel for me,I think there was just so much going on with all the different characters they had to fit in ,it just felt a little rushed.Ok there was plenty of screen time for Iron Man (as there should be),Doctor Strange and Spider Man,Thor and the Guardians were well catered for too,but the other Avengers and the stars of Wakanda less so,a little more Hulk might have helped.I hope this will be addressed in the next film,but in general a wonderful achievement by the Russo brothers.So because there was so much to take in ,I'm off to see it again tomorrow ,perhaps I will enjoy that bit more,and give it 10 out of 10.",10
Fav. Marvel Movie So Far,28 May 2018,"When i went to see this movie i was really scared , you know the hype ruins alot of stuff for us , you go in to the movie expecting alot and you be really afraid you'll be disappointed. Fortunately , This wasn't the case with Avengers Infinity war .

The movie was two and a half hours long , but i really couldn't feel the time , it passed like minutes or less . i enjoyed every minute of it , i thought every fight and every character and every story was well placed . i was afraid of being overwhelmed by all the characters being put in one movie , but i thought each one of them did his/her part without affecting the others parts as well. Thanos is By far my favorite Marvel villain , he's not a villain because he wants to be one , no , he has a vision , a bad corrupted one , but he has it a he'll do anything to make it happen . he really is a good villain .

I loved the comedy in the film , i loved that it wasn't too much , they weren't trying hard to make us laugh . the jokes were good and didn't take away the seriousness of the movie .

Shout out to the father-son-like relationship between SpiderMan And IronMan . I Just love them !!

Overall , great movie , worth watching more than once . you'll enjoy every second of it . I don't know if you can still enjoy it if you didn't watch all previous MCU movies , i personally recommend you watch them before watching this.",10
"Marvel is finally taking big risks. Comic fans welcome, general audience beware.",7 May 2018,"I begin with the caveat that this is in fact my first review on this site (even though I have been tempted to rant about others).

I am a major fan of superheroes and the battle between good vs. evil. I have watched every MCU movie to date except Black Panther (didn't get the chance to yet but will soon). I have enjoyed all of them to varying degrees and for different reasons, but one common element that I felt was lacking was consequence and risk for our heroes. Avengers: Infinity War changes that on a large scale, and it works perfectly for me. I loved it! It provides for a more powerful, emotional experience when the possibility of a villain succeeding is higher.

While this works well for my taste, I can see where some have issue, and I feel the need to caution those who have not seen it. I look to other reviews who have rated this film rather low and have voiced some of these concerns:











All in all, I recommend this movie to everyone, but be prepared. Avengers: Infinity War will not hold your hand if you're new to the franchise or to comics, and its not afraid to leave people behind as it takes this risky but awesome leap.",9

Exquisitely Human. Fantastically Otherworldly.,11 November 2018,"This was a high octane superhero film, and it was done beautifully and exceptionally well - and that's knowing the multitude of characters and storylines that had to be woven into this beast of an undertaking.

"Gripping, I couldn't take my eyes of the screen",12 April 2019,"This movie is teetering between PG-13 and R for how absolutely disturbing it can be (for PG-13 that is), but thats not bad. Its gripping in fact, for a super hero movie, it's just what it needs. Thanos is possibly THE best super villian to ever grace a superhero film, he isn't just someone doing it for fame, glory, wealth, or because he just loves to wreak havoc. He has a clear goal, and some of the things he does over the course of the film hurts him, and that shows how much dedication he has to doing what he thinks is right, you sometimes feel for both the villian and the hero, as it SHOULD be.

Recommended, excellent.",9
Mindblowing,27 April 2018,"I don't think I can ever recall the last time, if ever, I was anticipating a movie of such magnitude and excitement.

honest review,7 September 2018,"Look guys the movie will satisfy most of the fans , if you are action movie seeker or like to watch some cool scene ,,,,, then this is the right movie for you

but for all those viewers who want a good story with an inspiring moment like the"" The Dark Knight:"" or "" Spider-man 2"" i am very sorry to tell but to be honest ""its not even close to them"" this is an intense action movie which has ""super-villain creature"" in which this time can beat ""really not fake "" any avenger or superhero character and the movie give him good screen-time trying to explain to the audience who is ""Thanos"" and why he is doing this.... but with no great story or what do Thanos represent in our modern world or why defeating Thanos is important for us as an audience ,

As for example the ""Joker"" represent the chaos and madness ""Dr Octavious"" represent a man driven by his dream and did't see the reality or the consequences of what those dreams if accomplished it could harm the humanity

i think this movie is all about "" sit, watch and enjoy """,8

the best 2 hours or so in the mcu......,4 October 2019,"Simply for how it brought all these characters together. Its such a treat not just for comic book fans but for all cinema lovers.

The shear scope of all the story lines gives this particular film a depth I cant seem to compare to anything I've watched before.

This review is simply to highlight that fact.

Sure, there have been a multitude of films with plenty of stage players, but I would argue none (except maybe lord of the rings trilogy) bring such original characters. Each one fully distinguished and realized by great adapting in both writing and performance.

And if you are looking to just enjoy the comic book aspect, well the hero is appreciated more by the difficulty he or she faces in the villain. Infinity War delivers on the villainy in such unstoppable force and yet just as poetic as the hero's journey.

See this film and indulge in these characters stories.",10

Extremely inventive but derivative and totally predicatable until its finale,18 September 2018,,8
"The same old, same old",28 July 2018,"I will begin this review by stating that I am highly biased against all Superhero films. As in (almost) all the others that have ever been produced, Avengers: Infinity War falls in with the vast majority as a collection of over-worked cliches that are the backbone of this ""genre"".

I will admit that the banter of Tony Stark is clever. It always has been. I love Mr. Downey's ability to talk that talk. He is master of the fast, catch you on your heels style of verbal attack. For Tony Stark, it's a mixture of self defense and bringing you to the realization that you are actually dealing with a world class genius. A fun character. (Mr. Downey even sang on stage with Sting. Do a youtube search. You'll probably like it. I know I did). They toned the Stark character down simply because every one and their Superhero brother, aunt and sister made an appearence in this cliche. On to my other gripe. We have the trope of the Superhero landing. You know, one foot, one knee and a hand on the ground with the other hand and the head in some stylized pose. I permanently turned off the Wonder Woman movie, featuring eye candy Gal Godot, the minute I saw it.

I puke each time I see this trope and thankfully, I didn't see it in Infinity War so my thanks goes out to the cast and director but my trusty barf bag was at the ready. Mark Twain is reported to have said, ""History doesn't repeat itself but it often rhymes."" Right once again, Mr. Clemens!

I won't talk about the specifics of the film since truly, if you've seen one, you really have seen them all. I will confess and say that Deadpool 1 and 2 are the only two movies of this type that I actually enjoyed. We have actual human motivation and genuine, character driven drama and not just bombastic CG driven tripe. Plus the 4th wall is broken from time to time with irreverence. In other words, the DeadPool movies don't take themselves too seriously. That appeals to me.

As for the social aspect of why hungry audiences gobble up this tripe as quickly as Hollywood can churn it out is anybody's guess and here's mine. You live vicariously for the escape for 2 plus hours as you long to forget yourself and your society of hollow, mindless consumerism and its vapid celebrity worship. But I'll go no further with that since ameteur anthropology is best administered in very small doses.",5

Leaving You Wanting More,25 April 2019,"I watched the film Endgame, just the day before today, and it was amazing, so I gave it a brief but powerful review. Then, I realized I had forgotten to thank the film that led to Endgame, the one that broke my heart and warmed it at the same time. This film made me laugh, made me sit on the edge of my seat, made me cry, and made me infuriated for some people, making me want to throw a punch. This film makes you feel all the emotions: heartbreak, happiness, humor, and even fear. This will leave you wailing and complaining, needing more to satisfy you. Endgame is certainly more emotional and powerful than this one, with the topping 9.2 ratings, while this one is conveniently sitting at 8.5. This film and Endgame both made me confident, standing up to cruelty in my school, and letting me embrace how far Marvel has come.",9
Simply Spectacular,27 April 2018,"This is for me the best film from far away from Marvel Studios, it is everyone who has the best villain, although I really liked erick killmonger, Thanos is undoubtedly the best. The action scenes of this film are very good, but this is something that Marvel has already shown us, but something that makes this film so special is its courage in relation to other films from the same studio, the interaction of characters is also anything and more I do not say I only have to say that who has not seen the film should go see as soon as possible.",9
Mad Titan Steals the Show,28 April 2018,"This is going to be rather brief because it's difficult to discuss the film without spoiling anything. That said, oftentimes there's a pivotal moment or a reveal that drives a film's viewership based solely on hype and fervor. In such films, once the initial shock dissipates, there's little left to warrant rewatching, but it does encourage patrons to flood the box officer earlier than later. I suspect the studio push admonishing early moviegoers to avoid spoilers and inciting the hashtag movement, ""thanosdemandsyoursilence"", was likely a calculated tool to drive the hype. Infinity War, while having such pivotal moments, will probably stand as one of the better Marvel Studios films regardless of the hype.

The ensemble has matured together, and the on-screen chemistry is palpable. It's a blockbuster film that lends well to being seen in large-format or IMAX screenings. The sound mix is also one of the better mixes from Marvel Studios in that despite heavy use of low frequency effects and steady starship droning, the dialogue was crisp and clear. A friend of mine commented that the sound was fuller than other Marvel films and in many ways felt more like a Star Wars mix. I can't disagree with that. While there are jarring explosions and shrill screaming of streaking shrapnel and debris, the soundtrack was balanced with low rumbling, almost brooding, undercurrents. Of course all of this was highlighted and even carried by Alan Silvestri's score.

There were a few minor editing missteps, but I feel they were done in the interest of time and pacing. Despite this, I didn't notice continuity problems. Given the various converging story lines in addition to the myriad of Hollywood headliners who all need their respective screen time, the Russo brothers held this together quite well. In the wrong hands this easily could have become a theatrical Batman v Superman mess.

If you've read the 1990's Infinity Gauntlet comic story arc, you already have a good idea as to what's going to happen. Even so, I encourage you to keep this information to yourself in order to avoid ruining it for those that did not read the comics. There is an element of elitism among some comic readers in that some of them disparage those whose only knowledge base of these characters is solely gleaned from the films. I can also tell you, as a comic reader, you don't know everything that happens or even how it transpires. The film adaptation in many ways is only loosely based on the comic.

However, I am happy that they stayed true to the complex nature of The Mad Titan. Thanos was always a multifaceted villain. The challenges of green-screen and motion-capture acting didn't interfere with the stellar performance of Josh Brolin. Truly mad, but never unhinged, Thanos quite literally steals most scenes. The performance was captivating as Brolin effortlessly vacillates between brutal cruel tyrant, pitiful broken father, and calculated and devious manipulator. Thanos is a character Marvel Studios absolutely could not alter, and I'm pleased to say, this favored character was done justice.

In the coming weeks it will become increasingly difficult to avoid spoilers, so if you have any interest in the Marvel films, I encourage you to see this soon. If, by chance, some elements are revealed to you prior to your making it to the theater, don't be discouraged. If you're an Avengers fan, you will still enjoy this one. If you're a Thanos fan, you must see this.",9

Downer,4 August 2018,"I have the feeling that the makers of this film wanted it to be ""The Empire Strikes Back"" of the MCU. Without speaking to any story details, I'll say that from the very opening scene until the final shot of the film (and the post-credits preview scene) it's a ""downer.""

So, if you're the type of movie-goer who feels entertained by emotional downers, then you'll enjoy this film. My guess, however, is that most people who go to a Marvel film expect action AND a ""feel good"" at the end. That's not this film.

I'm glad I waited for the Amazon & iTunes RENTAL to come out...this is not a film I want to own, or will watch again.",5

Over the years I've caught pieces and snippets of other Marvel movies and they weren't bad! Guardians is fun! Black Panther is cool! Then Netflix got Infinity War. We watched it on Friday night. Whaaaaat? It's so good! Today is Saturday and we just finished watching Infinity War for the 2nd time. Exciting, fun, even if you don't have much of a backstory. Good times all around.

Avengers: Infinity War,17 September 2018,"Marvel studio outdoes itself once again in the Avengers series. How is it that a film of this nature could be so grandiose and powerful? Can be so heroic yet funny at the same time? The malleability of the team is simply incredible and you just feel the culmination of years of hard work paying off in this masterpiece. The antagonist's ambition and motive may be simple, but it feels realistic and most important asks questions about humanity and mankind, making him one of the best villain the series has showcased. The film is also a treat to the eye, and perhaps the best showcase of modern cinema. The only negative is perhaps the lack of closure, the feeling of yearning for more. There is no doubt that the film is a cash cow for Disney, but if anything it is a gorgeous golden cow, just keep milking it please.",9
Only for those who are heavily invested in this franchise...they'll be more easily pleased. 40%,3 June 2018,"Firstly, let me just admit that I haven't been devotedly watching every film in this series with a tie-in to this latest Avengers' outing. Looking at my reviews at this site, the last one directly related to this one that I saw was this film's immediate predecessor, ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"". From the moment this latest film begins, with superheroes dead or dying on what looks like the aftermath of some epic battle, it gives the impression of having immediately followed on from some previous Marvel film...which I haven't seen...which may or may not be the case. I.e. perhaps there was a film which showed the epic battle of which the opening scene is the aftermath? If so, then, obviously, it might pay to watch every single tie-in film to this one to be in the loop*, so to speak.

Secondly, apart from possibly not being a true stand-alone film, the ending also makes clear that there will have to be another Marvel film which will directly follow-on from the ending of this one. There are some obvious story elements in this latest Marvel film which makes clear that I have missed certain developments from previous Marvel films that I have missed (i.e. chosen to ignore...it looks like the only other Marvel film that I saw before Infnitity War was ""Deadpool"" and I do plan on watching the sequel to that sometime soon). Characters from other franchises also appear...e.g. the Guardians of the galaxy...another Marvel franchise that I have not seen (and the level of comedy that those characters reveal in this film doesn't make me feel like I've missed out on anything by not seeing that other franchise). Other characters, well...I have no idea who these people are...

All that being said, I have to say that none of this is an excuse as to how low the bar has been set for this film, as far as the writing, characterisation and entertainment factor goes. This tends to be a problem with most films in this universe...eventually I just get bored of seeing the sequels...which happened after the first Thor film for me and maybe the third Iron Man film, if I made it that far...or the Spider-Man reboots...perhaps even the latter film(s) of the Tobey Maguire incarnation of the character.

Anyway, the plot of Infinity War concerns a supervillain called ""Thanos"", who seeks to gain great power by collecting ""Infinity Stones"" (most of the names of these stones sound pretty unimpressive...I feel that marketing could have really put more work into coming up with cool sounding stones), which give him various mystical abilities which he uses for warlike purposes. He's already made a start on the collection of Infinity Stones (gotta catch 'em all!). Seeing Thanos in action against superheroes, he really does make them seem like boys fighting against men...who are warriors. An interesting aspect to Thanos' character is his psychology...he wants to collect all the Infinity Stones so that he can bring about much faster his plan to randomly kill fifty per cent of all life in the universe. He espouses reasons such as societies eventually collapsing and dying because there are too many people and not enough resources to sustain them. On that level, he does come across as rational...but is he? In other words, is he just so crazy he has to be stopped? Why fight it? Of course, such plans are anathema to superheroes and they try their best to stop Thanos.

So, the reason that I score this film poorly...it just doesn't try very hard to be entertaining, apart from in the action department. It relies on fans being so obsessed with the characters in this universe that they will lap up every attempted joke the writers have to offer. And the writers lack the wit of a Joss Whedon. For instance, one scene has Thor made to look an idiot (the bit where he tries to harness the power of a star) and another character (Hagrid?) labouring that obvious point as a result. Generally, most of the jokes fail. The odd joke works, but they aren't particularly high calibre. If you absolutely LOVE this universe, the writers are relying on you to be so invested and so well predisposed to these characters that they will have to do very little quality work for you to lap it up. In my review here of ""Age of Ultron"", I think I pondered whether I would continue seeing more films in this series. Based on this film, I think that it might be unlikely.

Contrast that criticism with films that are based on stories unknown to the public and/or with a cast of unknown leads...they can sometimes create a great emotional investment in the characters and story or amuse you with their wit and comedy. With Infinity War, it's all shorthand...the invested viewer has to fill in the gaps which the scriptwriters don't provide themselves, as far as characterisation and humour goes.

Some reviews that I've come across mention that favourite superheroes die in this film. Seeing what Thanos does immediately preceding such events makes me wonder how permanent such an outcome is.

* Having to watch EVERY film with a tie-in to Avengers' films just seems like too high a price to pay. It's not worth it, just for the latest Avengers film to make sense. Being entertained is more important to me, and eventually the sequels bore or the spin-offs underwhelm.

Random observations:

* I saw this film in 2D. It's my strong suspicion that forking out more to watch it in 3D would be a waste of money...nothing really struck me as being particularly geared towards a 3D experience and often Hollywood makes rather pointless 3D movies anyway...just a vacuous way to extract more money from the cinemagoer.

* The closing credits mentions ""Arrested Development character""...I wonder what that refers to.

* Near the start of the closing credits the name ""Okabayashi"" appears...not sure if I noted that accurately...but I did wonder if it was related to a a word I came across which related to the Star Trek universe: ""Kobayashi"" (I had to search a list of Star Trek video games to remind myself of that name!).

* Like a James Bond film, the closing credits have the phrase ""Thanos will return""!

* What's that black thing in Captain America's ear? Which film did I miss to see the explanation of that?",4
Marvel's Most Impressive Film to Date,27 April 2018,"This is one of the most anticipated movies of the year for many people. The hype surrounding this movie after ten years of buildup in the Marvel Cinematic Universe is something many fans have been looking forward to for a long time. I have to admit, I too was greatly looking forward to this movie. After having seen it on a packed Thursday night IMAX showing, I am more than satisfied.

Possibly this movie's greatest accomplishment is how successfully it manages to balance its massive cast. Most everyone in this movie gets a noteworthy role or a shining moment in the film. Most of the characters got what I found to be a reasonable amount of screentime. To me this is an immense feat, one which I remain impressed by. I found the choices of which characters got to interact together through their storylines to be quite smart, making for a very entertaining and funny movie to watch.

This movie successfully manages to retain that wonderful Marvel fun, in what was advertised as quite a dark movie. The comedy in this movie is very present, but almost never when it is unwelcome. It succeeds in being funny an impressive amount of the time, while still mixing well around the dark aspects of the story. That was all balanced very nicely.

I think that this movie did a very good job with tone, I imagine it was a very difficult process to figure out how to juggle these different connecting storylines with tonally different characters originating from different movies. I thought that it was, like most of this movie, very impressively balanced and handled. Maybe once do I recall a tone shift being a little too dramatic, but that was a very minor hiccup that did not impact the overall movie whatsoever. The way they managed to balance the comedy and the menace of Thanos and his mission is quite excellent indeed.

This was what I was initially worried about, Thanos. But man I was completely needlessly worried. Thanos is easily one of Marvel's best villains to date, not just from Josh Brolin's great performance and the impressive cgi, but from the believability and engaging nature of Thanos as a villain. Thanos is such a captivating villain, and the movie does a wonderful job at showing why he believes that everything he is doing is for the greater good. Like many great villains, he believes in what he does, he's not just bad for the sake of bad. I believe the movie really sells that, which is a crucial point to his character being compelling. Equally importantly, Marvel makes its most intimidating villain in Thanos, giving the audience a feel that this movie has real stakes, that he is someone to worry about, and that when he is on the screen, one should be scared of him. I found myself very intimidated, and was almost always fearful for people in the same scene as him. Easily one of Marvel's best villains.

I think that somehow the Russo brothers managed to do a wonderful job at presenting both entertaining characters, and making them feel real and believable. It's an impressive feat to bring so many characters from so many other creator's movies into this one, and to successfully capture their characters, and make their actions believable. I think it's absolutely incredible how well this was pulled off.

Something unsurprising the Russo's pulled off was the directing. The directing and action was good, having a more epic scale than the Russo's previous two films. This one feels more grand, the camera is often much more still than would be found in their previous two movies, helping the viewer to feel more grounded and presenting the world as larger. When important action scenes were going down, I was always invested. When important character scenes were happening, I was invested.

The music was very serviceable, and helped to elevate crowd-pleasing moments and get the crowd excited. I think this movie very successfully got my Thursday night crowd excited many times, there was a great deal of applause throughout the movie. This movie really is nonstop, with endless fun, action, some truly incredible moments throughout, and some genuinely shocking material. I won't say what they were, but many of my predictions going into this movie were wrong, and this movie was all the better for it. I'm glad I wasn't given the incredible task of making such a massive film.

It is of course worth noting that the story is great, it feels absolutely epic and the proper culmination of the last ten years of Marvel. Everything manages to fit together very well, and the grand nature of it makes it endlessly entertaining to watch. The story is most useful for seeing our characters struggle against seemingly impossible circumstances.

Above all, I find this to be Marvel's most daring film to date. A tone is set with the villain of this movie, and it is not an empty one. Thanos is intimidating and terrifying, I can't say that enough. While it manages to appropriately inject fun throughout the movie, it still maintains the scary nature of Thanos. He is intimidating, and his power really feeds into a true hopelessness that infected me, something the movie captures quite well. I do believe that some of the choices made in this movie are the most daring ones made in any Marvel film to date. I do believe that these daring choices, at least for the purposes of this film, were very successful.

Overall, this movie is impressive on so many levels. It succeeds in juggling a huge cast, balancing dark and fun tones, appropriately representing characters, having impressive direction, having fantastically crowd-pleasing moments, never ceasing to engage its audience, telling a great epic of a story, as well as being Marvel's most daring film to date. There was next to nothing I took issue with over this movie, and a great deal of stuff that I absolutely loved. I was very invested throughout the whole movie, and I genuinely don't think the film could've been much better. As I have said many times throughout this review, this movie is incredibly impressive. Naturally this review won't have any sway in your decision to see this film, as you most likely either already have seen it or are doing so in the immediate future. I still would like to offer this movie my praise, as well as give it my full recommendation, as one of, if not, Marvel's best yet.",9

Too many crossovers,17 January 2019,It's unbelievable just how many different films and characters this movie can cram in. Some funny moments but ended up turning the movie off before it ended. The Avengers started off well but this film is just too much and far too many crossovers. It's ruined the franchise for me,3
"""Earth's mightest heroes"" come together making epic film",13 November 2018,"I just wanted to write a review on a film that will forever remain so special to me maybe mostly because of today....for we have lost a man who started this franchise from the beginning: Stan Lee.

Stan Lee had a vision, to create characters that could entertain young and old worldwide and give a sense of hope to the world. Over the years his characters came to life on screen from Iron Man, Spiderman, Captain America, Thor, The Hulk and many more. They all served a purpose in their own stories and yet they all connected where this film comes to place. A film that translated them ALL together in one to stop maybe one of the strongest villains around.

Now I don't want to say any spoilers to this film, but I will say that seeing all these characters in one film was amazing. Each one stayed true to their characters and you could feel the excitement when each one took their scenes. For everyone who ever loved a superhero and see them work together...THIS FILM HAS THAT! And it's all because of Stan Lee and his passion for them all. I thank him for his imprint on this world and how I can look back on this film and see that he left this earth where all his mightest heroes came together to make an exceptional adventure and memories to never forget.",10

A heartbreaking power house!,27 April 2018,"After 10 years of Marvel it's finally here, Avengers: Infinity War. The movie is about Thanos trying to find all of the Infinity Stones so he can kill half of the galaxy. I don't want to give a oplot of things away so that's all you need to know.

First off what the Russo brothers did here is unremarkable, they give each and every character enough screen time and I don't know how they did it but it's incredible. Josh Brolin as Thanos steals every scene he is in, how they wrote his character is just perfect. You can see they learned a lot from Killmonger and Zemo on how to write great villians. The whole cast does phenominal, a big shoutout to Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark because yet agian he delivers a perfect preformance. Tom Holland as Spiderman is unbelieveble in this movie, so is Chris Evans, Zoe saldana, Chris Hemsworth, everybody brings their A game.

The fear I had going into this movie was that because there are so many characters that the tone would be just jumbled and messy, but the Russo brothers and the writers did such a fantastic job when there is a really dark scene, the next scene they give you a funny comment that's just perfect to switch the tone of the movie. Then they give you something funnier everytime so they build up to it, then when they want to make it really dark agian they give you something to switch the tones agian and it works perfectlly.

Avengers: Infinity war has the best directing in the whole series, and is a lot of fun but also very dark. I highly recommend this movie and I can't wait for the second part. What a fantastic movie!",8
"An artistic, visceral, breathtaking experience.",1 May 2018,"In the past, I've enjoyed marvel movies, but I've never been a huge diehard fan. I've gotten use to the formula and I went into this movie expecting more of the same. But I'm happy to say that wasn't what I got. Avengers Infinity War has to be one of the most intense, epic movies I've ever seen. With breathtaking visuals, awesome fight scenes, funny one liners, and possibly one of the best villains of all time, Avengers infinity war launches the series in a new, much darker direction than I ever saw coming. You will not be dissapointed.",10
My Review!,29 August 2019,"This one is a 'kickass'. The one even the celebrities would line up to watch. It releases the inner child in you and let it, it feels good. ;) If you haven't seen Captain America series, Iron Man series, Thor series, Guardians of the Galaxy series, Avengers series, Black Panther, Doctor Strange, this movie is not going to make sense. Watch them all and then hit the BIG screen. :)

The last 15 minutes of the movie are basically where everyone in the audience just had there minds blown and hearts broken. It was an emotional ride and a ride I would love to experience multiple times.",10

Everyone in this movie seems to have been dumbed down to an incredibly low level. I felt my brain actually turning to goo due to the lack of sense in this film. I'm so glad I didn't pay to see this.

I have watched this movie in IMAX 3D which is best and I only recommend everyone to see this movie in IMAX because it tells much more.

"This is not a film for outsiders to the franchise, but it rewards those who followed along.",31 May 2018,"To review this as a traditional film is a bit of a fallacy, I understand the reasoning but there is an aspect to the MCU that needs to be acknowledged by critics and viewership: These are episodic films. They are essentially a long-episode series. They are not stand-alones.

If you have not seen the major releases that play into this title (the Guardians films, Captain America: Civil War, Thor: Ragnarok) then you will neither understand nor enjoy this film. It's to be expected but I don't think it inherently makes this a weak episode-film. It is among the strongest MCU episode-films.

The film itself is one of the few MCU films that has an unconventional edge to it. Its central plot plays through the motives and actions of the villain, with the heroes playing supplementary roles in their various approaches to defeat him. The characters are overall well-written, though there are certain ones that may feel dubious to some viewers (I have seen mixed opinions on the Guardians' portrayal but I enjoyed it.)

Thanos himself is interesting and flawed, as well as fun to watch both as an enemy to our characters and as the possible protagonist. His power also appears to be over-the-top but it actually is quite balanced well in the end of the film.

McGuffin-hunting may break the film for others, and I can understand that, but the nature of it didn't bother me because I found it handled in an appropriate way.

Infinity War is not perfect by any stretch, I contemplated rating it a 7/10 instead of an 8...however I think tit was a very well-executed film with many redeeming qualities, and I hadn't enjoyed a Marvel film to this degree in a long while, and though I agree it's overhyped, I don't believe it should have to fit into the boxes that traditional critics continue to try and push on this episodic film series.",8
Meh.....,8 September 2018,"It was ok, but I was not overly impressed. Glad I didn't waste 20 bucks to see it in a theater.",5
The event we've all waited a decade for was worth the hype!,9 May 2018,"Review originally posted via Instagram (""@oratiosanctus"") on April 29, 2018:

~

Avengers: Infinity War was a film I was eagerly anticipating for not just months, but years. Ever since Iron Man took first flight in 2008 and Thanos turned to smile at the audience in the mid-credits scene of the first Avengers movie in 2012. A decade in the making. The Russo Brothers do an amazing job of making this film come across like that. Infinity War had the monumental task of bringing together plot threads from 18 previous films in Marvel's Cinematic Universe, but also to live up to the enormous ambition it had set for itself. Does it? Let's talk about it.

This film is an event, an action blockbuster that carries itself with real stakes and a truly mesmerising performance from Josh Brolin as the Mad Titan himself, Thanos. Here is a villain who is layered, menacing, and emotionally resonant. It is not hyperbole to state that for the first time in the MCU, the villain of this picture is its true star. The CGI work on Thanos is impeccable and Brolin's motion capture is jaw-dropping. This sits on the level of Andy Serkis' Gollum and Caesar.

One of the biggest fears going into this was how would it balance such a huge cast of characters? It does so admirably. Most are given their time to shine, and characters like Scarlet Witch and Vision are given their all to by their respective actors. This isn't a movie of one-liner cameos. Infinity War is undoubtedly Marvel's darkest and most daring film to date, and it tackles this with respect for what's come before it and to the pursuit of its own enormity.

However, like all of Marvel's movies, it is not without its flaws. The Children of Thanos (or The Black Order) are entertaining, if not at times, disposable. Ebony Maw is the clear standout and he steals every scene he's in. Proxima Midnight, Corvus Glaive, and Cull Obsidian are less interesting. The CG work is, at times, also lacking. While some characters you love will not get as much screen-time as others, the movie does a surprisingly effective job of making it appear they do.

This is one film guaranteed as best experienced on the big screen.",9
Did not know it was going to be so good!!!,25 January 2022,"I liked The first two Avengers movies but I was not obsessed, when I watched Infinity war I was not expecting it to be that great! It was definitely an exciting movie and I've watched it many times.",8
Greatest MCU movie ever!!!,27 April 2018,"Alright let's get something straight, to anyone rating it bad because it was all over the place and it was too funny, THERE ARE OVER 60 MAIN CHARACTERS OF COURSE ITS GONNA BE ALL OVER THE PLACE the Russo brother did a magnificent job on getting all characters into the movie first off but every character got 5 minutes or more of screen time which is incredible considering if all characters got 3 minutes individually, the movie would be 3 hours long of just characters appearing. Next if you think it was too funny, you clearly have never seen a marvel movie ever, they all are supposed to be hilarious, well maybe not captain America but still no one with common sense would want a MARVEL movie with little hilarity, and if you didn't realize, DRAX STARLORD IRONMAN ROCKET GROOT ARE ALL IN THIS MOVIE SO HOW COULD YOU NOT EXPECT HILARITY, clearly you have no sense of humour. Lastly if at the end you were like ""NO why would you do that, end the mcu like that, this movie sucks"" you do realize there is a second part coming out in 2019? Also if you get emotional (being any emotion except boredom) , then the movie did it's job, what you except to go into a movie and sit there and not feel anything and walk out with nothing happened? Point of a movie is to make you feel something anything except boredom it's called escapism.

Now for the short review part. This movie will play with your emotions like thanos plays with the avengers, right from the beginning to the end, if you've never watched a marvel movie or don't know any marvel characters then go home and binge watch all of them before going to see this. I've been watching the MCU for 10 years and this is the greatest Movie they've produced, the greatest special effects I've ever seen. I recommend going with your friends or even taking your family out to see this movie (it maybe rated PG-13 but that's means nothing it's basicslly an exceptional mark or something, I watched avengers in 2012 when I was 10 so your kids are good). I hope infinity war beats avatar in the box office and maintains an above nine reading one of the greatest movies of Everseen highly recommend to go see this movie.",8

"Good film, not as good as recent Marvel films",4 June 2018,,9
"A Thrilling and Emotional Ride, Not Perfect But Delivers Some Fantastic Performances and a High Stakes Plot",31 March 2023,"Avengers Infinity War brings together the most iconic characters from the MCU to face their greatest challenge yet, Thanos and the Infinity Stones. The movie, directed by the Russo brothers, stars a massive ensemble cast including Robert Downey Jr., Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Benedict Cumberbatch, Tom Holland, Chadwick Boseman, and many many others.

The plot of the movie revolves around the powerful villain Thanos played by Josh Brolin, who is on a mission to collect all six Infinity Stones, artifacts that will grant the wielder god-like powers over reality. The Avengers, along with the Guardians of the Galaxy, must band together to try to stop Thanos from achieving his goal and unleashing destruction on the universe.

One of the greatest aspects of Infinity War is the incredible action sequences that are executed with brilliant precision and creativity. Each fight scene is expertly choreographed and showcases the unique abilities of each character, resulting in some of the most exciting action sequences in all the MCU.

The performances in the movie are also tremendous, with each actor bringing their best to their respective roles. This particularly applies to Robert Downey Jr. As Tony Stark/Iron Man, and Josh Brolin's portrayal of Thanos who is able to make Thanos both menacing and empathetic.

In addition to the action and performances, the movie also boasts a strong emotional core. The relationships between the characters are explored in-depth, resulting in some genuinely touching and heartbreaking moments. The stakes really do feel higher than any MCU film before it, and the film is not afraid to explore darker and more mature themes.

The only real downside of Infinity War is that it can feel a bit overwhelming at times. With so many characters and plotlines to juggle, the movie feels a bit disjointed at times, and some characters don't get as much screen time as others when they really need it.

Overall though, Avengers Infinity War is a very thrilling and emotional ride that successfully brings together the most iconic characters from the Marvel Universe. While it may not be perfect, the movie delivers on its promise of epic action and high-stakes drama, making it a must for any fan of superhero movies.",9
Stunned and stunning,27 April 2018,"I just left the theater about an hour ago, and all I can say is that I am stunned by this incredible and impossible movie. What Marvel has done with this Universe and the stunning way in which the events have led us to this event is simply mind blowing. The first ten minutes alone offer more heart and dread than nearly all of the other movies combined. Infinity War will leave you as broken as the Avengers. The guts that it took to write and create this movie is immeasurable. I simply cannot believe what I just saw. Staggering.",10

The Ultimate movie,28 April 2018,"Every Marvel Movie has lead us to this point, we have seen glimpses of Thanos and now we realize what a Universe at war looks like!

"Brilliant movie, sets a perfect base for Endgame!!",4 August 2021,"Avengers: Infinity War is a superhero film directed by Anthony and Joe Russo and stars an ensemble cast including Robert Downey Jr., Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Benedict Cumberbatch, Don Cheadle, Tom Holland, Late Chadwick Boseman, Paul Bettany, Elizabeth Olsen, Anthony Mackie, Sebastian Stan, Danai Gurira, Letitia Wright, Dave Bautista, Zoe Saldana, Josh Brolin, and Chris Pratt.

After so many avengers films out of which some of them were extremely good and expectations were very high for this film and the movie doesn't disappoints. The film progresses step by step and credit should be given to the director and screenplay writer for keeping the story intact and gripping. Also the another best part of the film is that it makes a wonderful base for the Endgame and fuels up the interest to watch endgame.

The story of the film is food and execution is superb, the best part of the execution is that the execution is superb and will keep you intact. The music of the film adds as the icing on the cake.

The film has some of the best actors of Hollywood and everyone had already proved themselves in their respective characters. The climax of the movie is superb and as mentioned earlier gives a superb base for Endgame. A Must watch for all Marvel Fan.",10

An ambitious project that deftly delivers on its many promises.,8 March 2019,"It's difficult to codify something like Avengers: Infinity War (2018) without including everything that led up to it. In reality, it's probably more along the lines of the 19th episode of a television series that's taken ten years to realize fully. Because of the interconnected nature of these previous movies, it's difficult to view it alone without the backstory tied to it. However, there are enough brief moments of exposition to help most people fill in the gaps as to what is happening. Still, as is the case with many finales for television shows, the epic nature of Infinity War is at a level all its own.

The scale of such an endeavor is daunting, but with as little backstory as possible holding it back, Infinity War moves at a pretty good pace, jumping between a couple of groups of Avengers. Of course, we can't just directly jump to fighting the main villain, so the ""lesser"" bad guys stand in the way for a moment, but mostly fill time until the penultimate battles. At least during this waiting period, we get to learn the motivations of the heretofore mostly mysterious Thanos (Josh Brolin), which ends up humanizing this terrifying villain who thinks he's doing the right thing.

While the action is probably a little too shaky at times, the team-ups are what sell this movie. No longer are there coy little cameos and winking nods to references from other Marvel films (although, there is a somewhat shocking cameo about half-way through), but instead full-blown connections that expertly ties up the disparate parts of the 18 previous films. With an ending as shocking as this one, I'm a little curious where Marvel goes from here, but I have my hunches about what the future will bring.

An ambitious project that deftly delivers on its many promises, I give Avengers: Infinity War 4.5 stars out of 5.",9

Best movie,13 May 2018,Hi this best movie just watch don't ask everyone you know to watch it its the best,10
Spectacular. Its Thanos show all the way.,28 April 2018,Infinity war has everything to offer. It has best CGI and thanos actually looked real at some points. Thanos hands down is one of the best CGI villain in superhero movie and second best CGI character after gollum from lord of the rings trilogy. Movie ends on a high note which may anticipates us for avengers 4 and post credit scene which teases us for captain marvel. Acting was top notch and thanos made me believe MCU villain doesn't suck ass. 2 films of marvel in 2018 and we have already got 2 best villain killmonger and thanos. I just want to say this movie is spectacular and must be seen on big screen like IMAX. You simply cannot miss this film. Its a visual treat and lots of unexpected things would come so be prepared for it. I am going for 10/10 because this film can be simply enjoyed in theatres not on laptop or tv screens. Thank You!,10
So far the best.,26 April 2018,"It is. The best MCU movie, and my #1 favorite. This is something that I've never seen before in the MCU.

It's well balanced between the humor and the seriousness. It made me tear up a lot, I'm pretty sure many others cried too. I got surprised so much that I was literally in shock, even after the credits start rolling. It's darker than any other ones.

I am definitely satisfied with Avengers: Infinity War. Though maybe it will be hard to take in, I recommend everyone to watch it. Every Marvel fans shouldn't miss it.",10
GREATEST SUPERHERO MOVIE OF ALL TIME,28 April 2018,"I was totally speechless at the end of the movie. The entire cast were at the top of their game in this film. The action scenes were obviously fantastic, the CGI on Josh Brolin was perfect, the special effects were amazing, and the movie included over 60 characters!!! This movie was off the charts! I can't wait for part two to come already. Everyone needs to see this movie!!!!",10
The hype is real,7 May 2018,"The biggest (in all sense) and definitely the most darkest movie of the Marvel Universe has finally arrived and it has arrived in style just like its antagonist Thanos. Avengers: Infinity War is an ensemble of characters at the highest level. It is a treat for ardent Marvel fans and to the other movie fans it's kind of an emotional jolt.

Unlike most other movies which centers around its protagonists, Infinity War is very much about its antagonist Thanos. The whole movie is an answer to all the bits of Easter eggs that we saw in other Marvel movies until now. Thanos goes around the universe gathering infinity stones to fulfil of his purpose of bringing a 'balance' to the universe while the split up Avengers get back together to stop him. While we get answer to many questions, some other questions start forming in our head. This time the superpowers are much more advanced, the space travel is simpler and quicker. It is very hard connect the dots and analyse them as the movie has an unstoppable and intense screenplay. The humour although much lesser compared to its predecessors, still delivers quality. There are many goosebump worthy moments which in themselves are worth of the ticket price. The only downside for me was watching this in IMAX 3D which didn't make much of a difference at all.

It is very hard to write about individual characters and performances in a movie as big as this. However the mega villain Thanos lives upto the hype of the character. It is also interesting to see the emotional and confused side of the character as well. Josh Brolin with his deep voice suits in every bit. I am a bit skeptical about how other characters get to know each other in a quick team and form a team. It is both entertaining and emotional at the same time to see them together in the big screen.

Avengers: Infinity War is absolutely the biggest Marvel Movie so far and it is anything but over.",9
Pretty stupid treatment of the heroes,7 October 2018,"I swear, every one of these cool, powerful, trained warriors acted like idiots without power or any tactical thinking ability. The special effects etc tend to distract you from the horrible treatment of the Marvel heroes, at least.",4

I cannot believe this!,14 October 2018,"I am flabbergasted by all the incredibly negative reviews of this movie. Is it the best movie ever made? Of course not. Is it, as some puerile reviewers imply, the worst movie ever made? Nope, it ain't that either. Somewhere in the depths of reviewer land there exists a rating that is much more reasonable, say an 8 or so. So that's the rating I'll give it. I enjoyed this movie. It kept me entertained, and, excuse me, but that's all most movies should aspire to.",8
The best superhero movie ever!,11 March 2019,This movie is just insane! No words! I can't wait for Avengers: endgame!,10
"Entertaining, semi-predictable and emotional.",6 June 2018,,10
Well deserved,20 May 2018,"A fantasy movie is maybe the easiest movie to end up OK, but maybe the hardest to make magnificent. And they did exactly that. They deserve the 9/10",10
Best Film I have ever seen,29 January 2019,This is my most favorite film I have watched over 15 times yet...and I'm still watching every month,10
Top movie ever.,20 April 2019,I have never seen such a great or powerful movie in my lifetime . Bravo Marvel.,10
Another Millennial Comic Book Movie - Avengers: Infinity War,30 January 2023,"There is enough real tragedy from real wars in the world, as well as for the children who survive them. They will view these types of films and give a little chuckle to themselves at the naivety of Hollywood, and how insensitive it is to real world events and people. However, my son, Joseph, got me to raise my rating from 4 to 5 stars because he liked the Iron Man performance of Robert Downey Jr, the only legitimate actor in the entire film. What a shame that Downey has to play such egregious roles; he is worthy of much better ones. So, if you like marvel comics, kids, this one is for you. I read mine when they first came out; and they were a lot more interesting than these movies.",5
"Falls just short of the MCU gold-standard, Winter Soldier, but a great movie. Must-see.",27 April 2018,,10
Has written history,6 October 2019,It was a great movie with non stop action and thrill that u will never have that feeling in any movie,10
I want to look forward to the next film,30 January 2019,"I'm still very curious about this film, because it's so full of a mystery and doesn't know what it will be like in the end",10
Amazing,27 April 2018,"It was an amazing movie in 2018 till now. All cgaracters did good work. My favorite was Thor, Iron man, Thanos. This characters did a amazing work Thanos was killed it in villain role.",10
Truly something special,28 April 2018,"Boy oh boy, what great fun this film is. To think it all began ten years ago with Iron Man, and to now witness the scale and ambition is truly something special. It felt historic. Credit where credit is due, director, Anthony and Joe Russo blend all these characters in so well and seeing how they interact is as hilarious and special as always. Having spent time with them for so long now, we find ourselves attached and that's why it works and we root for them. I'd argue Thanos is the MCU's best villain yet, a character whose god complex and interesting ideology separates him from traditional notions of the villains in the MCU. Oh, and there's also the fact that he can actually compete with the heroes, with many of them feeling inferior to Thanos and his army. There is more depth to him that I first imaged, and the CGI and performance by Brolin is great. It's a treat to see the whole audience laughing, clapping, gasping-something not all films do these days. It's a testament to the creative team behind this universe, (Kevin Feige etc.) because they have simply been so consistently ambitious. If there is one thing, the humour in the film did surprise me, and with that said it does take away from the emotional scenes. It is a Marvel film however, and to think that its staple blend of humour and action wouldn't be as prominent is perhaps an oversight. When you actually think what this film has done, combing the ten years worth of stories, and putting together characters who haven't yet met, all in the space of two and a half hours, it is an achievement worth celebrating and enjoying.",9
"At that moment,I thought Thanos isn't a bad guy.",19 May 2018,What's the main idea?Who cares about it! I saw Thanos's heart deeply through the movie. It is so strong but weak! The character moved me ! And I also think Thor evolved by taking those troubles. Look forward to the ending!,10
LIVES UP TO HYPE,27 April 2018,I've been following the Marvel Cinematic Universe from the start and I couldn't have been more impressed and satisfied with Infinity War. Enough has been said.,10
too much and yet so little,22 September 2018,,5
some notes,2 August 2018,"The problem with the film is to weak some strong characters:
Vision: We find it rarely used stone beam .. and needs help from others after it was the strongest Avengers.
Dr. Starng: He had opportunities to use the stone to restore time .. To try to taking the glove from the hands of Thanos .. & To save the Iron Man .. and He could make an opening to return to the ground instead of asking the Iron Man to try to return the spacecraft.
Thor .. In the movie Ragnarok .. Did not need the hammer at the end of the film .. Now need it again ?? Why ??
Black Widow: in the movie Iron Man .. was using slides are thrown on the person and hit him with an electric shock .. Now we see fighting as any soldier in a battle without any sophisticated weapons.",5
Ugh,8 September 2018,"Went down the 'event cinema' route. Lots of flying about. Lots of confused fighting. Too many characters. Ludicrous, unjustifiable character actions used to move the film along. They opted against using too much humour this time around too. It felt like a film made by committee of management consultants.",5
So looking forward to this movie and was disappointed instead.,27 April 2018,,5
Dull,29 April 2018,Boring. I was in the cinema and bored. Want a refund. I prefer Batman,1
Makes no sense whatsoever,19 April 2019,,1
Trash,3 October 2019,"That's all I am ever going to say about Avenger movies. Pure trash and garbage. Don't watch this, don't let your kids watch it. Pure trash trash trash.

That's it. Nothing good to say here.
