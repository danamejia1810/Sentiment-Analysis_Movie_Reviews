The most important film in MCU,2 December 2020,,8
Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015) Review - 8.3/10,12 December 2020,"This film isn't nearly as bad as some people make it out to be. While the story isn't as good as the first Avengers, the acting is still just as good, the action is even better, and Ultron isn't a bad villain, he's just an under-developed one. Honestly, the action makes up for most of the flaws of this movie and it also set up a lot of MCU films, or at least foreshadowed a lot. Movies like Black Panther, Avengers: Infinity War/Endgame, and Captain America: Civil War. Overall, this isn't a bad film, at all, but it is the weakest of The Avengers franchise.",8
An enjoyable ride,18 January 2021,"Cool seeing them all together again, even if I didn't massively enjoy it. It's good, nothing more or less in my opinion.

'Avengers: Age of Ultron' isn't too far off 2012's 'The Avengers', especially in terms of how I fell about it. I definitely wanted more from both, yet they are still satisfying superhero action flicks. I'd rank this narrowly below the aforementioned.

Robert Downey Jr. felt a little flat to me as Iron Man - he still has a decent amount of moments, just not as many as you get in his individual films. All the others continue to entertain to an equally suitable level, I didn't overly like the characters of Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen but I also don't have any noteworthy negatives about them. The story between Scarlett Johansson and Mark Ruffalo didn't do much for me either.

With that noted, it is still an enjoyable ride through the 141 minute run time. The ending is intriguing, interested to see where that goes - I have a minor inkling about the mid-credits scene, given all the internet attention that has had - even for someone like me who knows very little overall.",7
The son of Megatron and Skynet meets Tony Stark and his Amazing Friends,14 December 2015,"In 2012, there came a day unlike any other day where the worlds greatest heroes were united against a common threat and THE AVENGERS blew away audiences of all ages with the first ever comic book movie crossover. In 2015, there came another day unlike any other day and this time the world is threatened by a Ultron, the cynical critical atypical child of Skynet and Megatron...... No actually he's just a wisecracking artificial intelligence with delusions of godhood and all round evil. Turning on his creators, he threatens all life on earth with his sidekicks ""illusion- woman"" and ""not-the-flash""....I mean, Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver, and it is up to the Avengers to take him out before he can usher in THE AGE OF ULTRON.

Instead of the robot dominated dystopian future that we saw in the comics, what we do get is more ""the next few days of Ultron"". No matter, it is an exciting few days with director Joss Whedon balancing the intercharacter dynamics with awesome action pieces from claustrophobic close combat, to a freeway chase, to the much advertised no holds barred beat down between the Hulk and iron man's new ""hulk buster"" Armour. All this is supplemented with beautiful special effects from Industrial Lights and Magic ILM. Flawless work befitting the movie's massive Budget.

In The villain, Ultron, the Writers have crafted a memorable though under utilised bad guy. Ultron could have been the vehicle to explore deeper themes, themes that were merely hinted at but never fleshed out. Instead, His cynical yet refined snarling courtesy of James Spader reminds me of the those magnificently passionate Super villains that were so common in Saturday morning cartoons of old.

And that is exactly what this is. AGE OF ULTRON can be described as a true live action cartoon. The dialogue is light hearted, the story is straightforward, the tone is fun and the action is immense. And this is not exactly a good thing. Intense scenes are interrupted and spoilt with poorly placed humour and once again the story does not seem to take itself seriously.

Fights are over-choreographed, more like some fancy ballet than an all out battle. The fact that it cuts to graceful slow motion once in a while only emphasises the dance like nature of the fights.

And yet the movie felt like pieces of it were cut out. The narrative does not flow as smoothly as the first with inexplicable scenes like Thor suddenly going off on his hallucination trip. Much of the premise and the characters development up to this point very much depends on the viewer watching prior marvel movies.

It is here that Marvel studio's continuity heavy Creative direction rears its ugly head. To know what is going on in this movie, one would have to watch the previous movies. Captain America the winter soldier, iron man 3, the first avengers movie. But perhaps that's the point? Force people to go buy the Blu rays or the video to rewatch and get up to speed. In the end, the real big winner is distributor Disney. Ka-Ching $$.

I like a good comedy. In in a big action blockbuster, I like to believe that the stakes are real, that the dangers faced by our heroes are real, that they are really fighting for the fate of the world. Instead, we get this cartoony violence, with equally cartoony superficial story, where heroes joke around with quick lighthearted quips in the middle of a fight scene where people could die. This kills tension. And if it weren't for the magnificent effects, action and direction, AGE OF ULTRON would have scored a bit lower.",6
One word: Mjollnir!,1 May 2015,"I have noticed a trend of negative reviews directed at the humor in the movie. Listen...humor is subjective. It's also a big part of these types of movies. When I read someone criticize the movie because the heroes are dropping one-liners during intense fighting scenes and to them, this downplays the seriousness of the situation or shows a lack of concern for safety from our heroes, I shake my head so hard I get dizzy.

This is a comic book movie! It's a fantasy/fiction/whatever you want to call it! I'm not a comic book expert, but have been a big fan of the Marvel Universe on film since Iron Man 1. I found the writing in AoU to be sharp and witty. And yes, I laughed more than I thought I would.

""There's not enough character development!"" I've seen this in the negative reviews, too. Look, we've had 3 Iron Mans, 2 Captain Americas, 2 Thors, and a Hulk movie to develop the characters. At this point, there isn't much more we really need, is there? Yes, we see more about Hawkeye's personal side here, but to me, that only feels fair since he's not big enough to carry his own film. And given that he's very much just a human with a great set of physical skills and is less protected and faces his mortality far more than the others do, I felt like it made perfect sense here. We see and learn more about Black Widow in this one, as well. So the complaints about character development don't hold any weight to me. It sounds like the angst of a group of people expecting to see the Empire Strikes Back version of the Avengers.

In Age of Ultron, we get immediate, sustained action. I don't know about you, but if I'm going to watch a movie with a cast of characters that have the abilities of the Avengers, I want to see them in action! The creativity of the collaborative fighting was improved as well and was featured much more so than in the first one. That was something that I think the first film lacked, the side by side teamwork. This movie held my attention from start to finish.

As my summary says above, Mjollnir is a pleasantly surprising star of the movie. When you watch it, you'll see why and in my opinion, if you don't enjoy its role here, you really just have a bad attitude!",9
Grossly underwhelming (spoiler free),25 April 2015,"Spoiler free review. Let me first start of by saying that I am not a Marvel ''fanboy'' or a DC nerd. The comic book genre of films have made it to my personal top 3 favourite genres in the last decade and the MCU has been a strong contributor to that rise. I hold the first Ironman, first Avengers and Captain America 1+2 in high regard. I did not like the direction they took with Iron Man 3 (more on this below) or Guardians of the Galaxy but Winter Soldier was a gem in terms of balancing solid action, drama and levity.

That being said, my initial thoughts on Age of Ultron (AoU) are quite negative. To me, its essentially a carbon copy of IM3. There are problems which strike you repeatedly as you progress throughout the film. The 2 biggest complaints I have with AoU is 1) the tone (comedy) 2) the script/writing.

So starting with the tone. I like to laugh as I'm sure most people do, but there is a time and place to exhibit your comedy writing skills in an action film. In AoU, its a constant, recurring and predictable theme. It's not limited to one character either, everyone is popping one liner jokes as if its the Expendables and yes, most are not funny. The timing of these moments of levity are horrible too, desensitising the viewer to any impending fear of death in battle. If the characters seem so relaxed in not worrying about possibly dying, then what suspense is needed to be held by the audience? This plagued IM3 in a bad way and its arguably worse here. The comic book films which achieved great success in this regard were XMen DOFP, The Avengers 1, Cap 2 even Dark Knight Rises! Can you imagine at the climax of Xmen DOFP if old Magneto and Storm and Bishop start pulling one liner jokes as the army of sentinels came charging at them? It would kill any tension! 2) The script. I won't say too much since this is a spoiler free review, but it really feels rushed and unorganised. I watched Fast 7 around 2 weeks before AoU and I got similar vibes. Again, its not the fact that the film is 2.5 hours long or has too many characters, that isn't am excuse since The Dark Knight and Xmen DOFP shows how to navigate these theatrical obstacles. There are a few completely unnecessary subplots in AoU and useless characters which do not impact the story overall. The villain himself, Ultron is another massive let-down in Marvels already growing catalogue of mishandled villains.

So as a summary, if you want mindless action and cool CGI, which this film does offer in the form of some spectacular visual fight scenes then you will like AoU. If you are after a darker, grounded and more moving story like the trailers promised, you will be severely disappointed. Final score 6/10 and I am being kind since Cap is my fav Avenger and they finally gave him some good screen time.",6
"Behold, the world's largest conveyor belt",5 March 2016,,
"Avengers: Age of Ultron is a damn good Superhero flick, excellent sequel!",8 May 2016,"Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015) is a MARVEL damn good superhero flick and an excellent sequel! Yes it is miles way better than Jurassic World and Star Wars: The Force Awakens and Terminator Genisys I have enjoyed this film much better than Jurassic World, Star Wars and Terminator the new movies.

This film is fun, popcorn, Action and entertaining action sequel flick. I like the first one but I love this one much more. The first time I watch it, I did not like this film at all, it did not work for me, but the second time around this flick was awesome and it become one of my favorite MARVEL superhero movies. I love this film so much, more than the first Avengers. James Spader made the movie for me! So much better than Loki.

James Spader and Robert Downey Jr. played together in a teen movie Tuff Turf in 1985 and 30 years later they teamed together to star in a MARVEL comic book super hero film. I like Tuff Turf but Avengers: Age of Ultron is far way better film to me. I love this film so much and I will never get the backlash. Joss Whedon gave me everything I wanted in a sequel. This and the first film are in my top 10 films of all time.

I waited a long time for this universe and I am loving every minute of it. Superhero movies come out all time but something like this is what I love about movies.

Plot: Tony Stark creates the Ultron Program to protect the world, but when the peace-keeping program becomes hostile, The Avengers go into action to try and defeat a virtually impossible enemy's to get. Earth's mightiest heroes must come together once again to protect the world from global extinction.

I really enjoy this movie I don't get the backslash and a lot of people were disappointed with this sequel that it is not so good as the first film. Age of Ultron is in my top 3 favorite comic book films. Number 1 will always be Captain America: The Winter Soldier and number 2 will be Captain America: The First Avenger, I just love those two films: Captain America is my favorite superhero character in MARVEL comic books.

Captain America in this movie is the most decent hero in this movie, he did not want the leave the island with people stuck on it, he refused too, I have seen a hero in him.

People are keep getting upset over Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), ""oh look what they did with Black Widow."" I saw the film and I am seeing her kicking ass or calm down the Hulk, which is a pretty ballsy thing to do. Specially for someone who has no balls and she is kicking ass and driving motorcycle, driving around shooting for Cap, helping them to get vision android to beat Ultron and she is the only one with no powers, except Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), she has the to get the thing for them. I think it would be weird to kidnapped Thor, if you put Thor in the scene duh. I enjoy this movie much more than the first film, the first film I liked okay, I like the first Avengers film. This is a fun popcorn entertainment flick that I really love.

I like the romance between Black Widow with Hulk it was really good fast paced entertainment. I love Elizabeth Olsen as Wanda Maximoff / Scarlet Witch I like the twist by the end of the film that she turn her side around when she found out that Ultron wants to destroy everything on this planet I love that. You have Aaron Taylor-Johnson in it from Kick-Ass film as Pietro Maximoff / Quicksilver sadly he dies on the end of the film, but he saves Hawkeye and a kid from Ultron firing bunch of bullets on them I thought that was pretty decent in the film. In my opinion Aaron Taylor-Johnson did a good job playing his character. I love that they return Samuel L. Jackson to the movie back as Nick Fury and that he help them out fighting Ultron. James Spader did a terrific excellent job playing Ultron.

Avengers: Age of Ultron is a 2015 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics superhero team the Avengers, produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures. It is the sequel to 2012's The Avengers and the eleventh film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU).

You have a lot of action in it, I also love that Tony Stark, Steve Rogers, Thor, Bruce Banner (Hulk), Natasha Romanoff, and Clint Barton work together after Ultron failed to destroy them and they go in to safe house to Clinton's family, I like that. When Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) touches Black Widow, Iron Man and Thor I like that you see a background of Natasha Romanoff's childhood, I like that. I love the African shipyard you see them on a ship and I love the last stand. I love that the Vision helps Avengers to destroy and stop Ultron from extinction. Btw I love to death Black Widow / Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson) she is so beautiful and charming I love her. Overall: I am giving this flick 10 out of 10 for me Age of Ultron is my #3 favorite super hero movie. I can't wait for the next movie: Captain America: Civil War.",10
VERY GOOD SEQUEL,21 April 2021,"In Avengers Age of Ultron the Avengers fight Ultron, an artificial intelligence obsessed with causing human extinction. The movie is a mostly satisfying sequel. It's full of action and darker than the first one. Sometimes it has a great sense of humour, the main villain is well characterized and the final act is full of tension and emotional. However in the first half isn't always gripping and there are some ridicolous moments. It isn't as good as the first one but it's still a fun and entertaining ride to join.

Rating: 7,4.",7
"Solid, if slightly flawed, entry in the Marvel Universe",4 May 2015,,8
"Messier, for sure, but still plenty of ""Avengers"" fun",8 May 2016,"The task of bringing together Earth's mightiest heroes took Joss Whedon into uncharted territory with 2012's ""The Avengers,"" and, despite the weight of the Marvel Cinematic Universe on his shoulders, the results were staggeringly entertaining. The task of making a sequel to that ground-breaking, monumental event film, however, and being expected to deliver on par or better results, is an entirely different beast.

""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" was definitely built on the bullet point takeaways of ""The Avengers,"" which are: Make time and space for wit, banter and humor for the sake of humor to prevent the film from taking itself too seriously; give each character a story arch and independent moments; choreography clever action sequences with well-timed glory shots. These components are in full force in ""Ultron"" and make enjoying the blockbuster as easy as shoving a lollipop in your mouth.

Yet ""Ultron"" is infinitely more complex than its predecessor. The number of heroes featured barely fits into a single action figure play case, meaning more subplots and back story, in addition to creating an arch of the creation and life of Ultron itself. With a plot that takes the Avengers from the eastern European country of ""Sokovia"" to New York to the African nation of ""Wakanda"" to Seoul, South Korea to Sokovia again, much of ""Age of Ultron"" is a non-stop blur.

The film opens with the Avengers leading an assault on a secret HYDRA facility where they have located the staff that Loki used to lead the Chitauri invasion in ""The Avengers."" When they secure it and bring it back to New York, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) and Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) discover that its power source contains a blueprint for artificial intelligence, which would allow Stark to proceed with his Ultron project, an initiative to create peace-keeping robots that could defend the world in place of the Avengers should another alien invasion occur. When Ultron (voiced by James Spader) becomes conscious, however, he interprets his peace-keeping instructions as an imperative to wipe out humankind.

Added to the mix are the Maximoff twins, Pietro (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and Wanda (Elizabeth Olsen) – also known as Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch – who decide to serve Ultron, with the latter using her powers to give each of the Avengers dangerous visions that could tear them apart.

The fight scenes and action sequences are in such abundance in ""Ultron"" that it's impossible to remember them all, and the ones that are most distinct, such as Iron Man chasing down and taming a rampant Hulk using his Hulkbuster armor, are ancillary to the narrative of finding what Ultron is up to and stopping it. In other words – it's all for show. The creativity of the fight choreography also gets lost in the whirlwind of action. Captain America (Chris Evans) probably does 12 different awesome things with his shield, but they happen so fast you'll be hard pressed to recall any one of them in detail. Really clever sequences are only as fun as the build-up and payoff and those pieces are given no time to breathe.

Whedon does allow for pauses in the chaos, such as the swanky Avengers Tower party featuring the film's best scene, when each Avenger tries his hand at lifting Thor's hammer, or a quiet retreat to an unexpected safe house in the countryside, but it's simply a trade- off: instead of busy action sequences, we get character relationship dynamics and back story.

""Ultron"" is inundating, to be frank, but for the everything-but-the-sink mentality, it's carried by its sense of humor and a cast whose members have each proved themselves time and again to be magnetic both on their own and as part of this team. Some of the novelty has worn off, but seeing all these characters together remains a treat that even the most convoluted of stories cannot entirely dismantle. Marvel Studios truly proves with ""Ultron"" the credibility that it has built with fans, to the point that even when it gets a little ambitious and mettles a bit more (you can easily see Whedon at odds with them in this final cut), its reputation remains intact and the fans placated.

As ""Phase III"" begins, adding even more characters to Marvel's cinematic universe (and even sliding Spider-Man into the mix) en route to the two-part ""Avengers: Infinity War"" slated for 2018 and 2019, it will be interesting to see if Marvel Studios barrels along into more unwieldy but delicious chaos, or reins it in a touch. Either way, should be fun.

"Really Good, Very Underated",4 January 2021,"Avengers Age Of Ultron is considered as one of the worst entries in the MCU but I think that this film is very interesting and intriguing. The film had a very cool and intelligent storyline and the chemistry between the characters was really funny.

I also liked how Joss Whedon took characters like Hawkeye and Black Widow and gave them more of a backstory which made the characters more interesting.

The only thing I don't like about this film is that Ultron didn't really have anything to be evil about but he isn't the worst villain that has been introduced into the franchise so it didn't really put me off from the film.",9
Disappointing,30 April 2016,,6
"What a Shame, we live where Studio's take control",26 April 2016,"being a huge Marvel fan, and also Josh Whedon fan I was super excited for him to come back and do another Avengers movie. The first film was pretty brilliant. But with this film, Whedon wasn't given much air to breathe, with constant Studio interference and orders of certain shots to be re- done, or scrapped if not worse. Put in.

So, you thinking why is this film so bad, if you are a fan, you should love it. Well the film changes pace, very quickly and abruptly, which is a poor sign of movie making. The Characters do not act like they would usually act in the same scenario, the progression of the story is all over the place, Scene's that just have no weight or meaning to the film, but in there because it looks cool or is setting up another independent super hero movie, the Villain that is so smart, but doesn't use the internet and his ability to control everything just to wipe out everybody, but rather has this ridiculously stupid plan. The Hero's that are suppose to be smart, intelligent and some what Spanish do not see all of the stupid plot hole that get infiltrated.

The fighting was also a problem for me, it was the same. Once you saw it in the first Avengers, you see exact same thing in the second one too, and it doesn't even change a little.

Overall, this film is bunched up due to the constant interference by Studio as Josh has stated so many times now.",5
"Action, action and action",30 April 2015,"Spoiler free review.

I can't say the film didn't lack action because it didn't, every minute was filled with brilliant effects and amazing shots. An action packed adrenaline ride all through. However this said the film lacked story. At first the film was taking over from the first avengers, the story was good. But somewhere into the film the story fell apart with too much happening and without the solid story line it felt weak, with no real connections at all there was just fighting and action all over. I thought from what little story this film had to offer it was a lot more comic based than the previous one. The main villain in this film felt like a weakly based character, he had little to do with the story and was probably a contributing factor into it's downfall.

In conclusion I thought that the action, acting and effects are among the best, however the weak story left me with a far different feeling to the first. I thought although this film was great for a sequel it wasn't as good as the first. The film felt like it was meant to put a story across ready for the next film, which I hope will have a better story and live up to my expectations! However if for now you're looking for a great action film this is definitely a great one to watch, even though the story was weak and lacked that edge it is still a great film and hopefully will make an even better trilogy!",7
Assorted Trivia for AV2....,25 April 2015,,9
"When Tony Stark tries to jump start a dormant peacekeeping program, things go awry and Earth's Mightiest Heroes have to battle to save Earth",13 April 2015,"The Avengers: Age of Ultron is one of the best movie I've ever watched(not biased). I am a Marvel fan that also like DC movies and series, but in my opinion I think DC makes good TV series on small screens however I think Marvel makes great movies on big screens. The Avengers: Age of Ultron is the best superhero film in my opinion because of the huge surprises in the movie and the incredibly thrilling storyline from the comics, the directors of the movie did change the storyline a bit though, it's not like a copy and paste storyline from the comic book. Therefore, this is the best superhero film of all time in my opinion.",6
"Explosive and Visually Extravagant, Yet Also Profound",22 April 2015,"Given how teeming with multiple awkwardly-diverse characters the AVENGERS franchise is, you can imagine how difficult and mentally-exhausting it is to gather all these uniquely vivid plot lines, with all their interspersing expositories and asides, and still be able to form one coherent and fluidly-constructed narrative. The first Avengers movie proved itself able to carry the weight of such challenge, and came out successful in delivering one the most poignant superheroic tales ever told. This year, AGE of ULTRON blasts into cinemas carrying the load of mammoth anticipation. While it is expected to perform better—if not as well as the previous release—it will not be totally surprising, and will still be forgivable, if it falls just a feet beneath the staggering anticipation. Well, you can thank Joss Whedon for helming this projec. This movie soars past expectations.

In AGE OF ULTRON, as the characters further expand, new names join the team, proving how much more difficult it must be for the screenwriters to still cling to their material's soundness, and make that further engaging and compelling. Nevertheless, Whedon and his prolific team of scriptwriters, come out triumphant over these apparent hurdles, managing again to weave all the heroes' divergent story lines and confine them together into one solid plot. Whedon effectively mines the capacities of these individuals and turns them into the very foundation of his epic superhero saga.

Robert Downey's Iron Man/Tony Stark remains as a formidable figurehead in spite of his ever cynical and highly confident posture, while Chris Evans provides a dependable alternative with Captain America's leadership. There's an implicit undertone playing beneath the trajectory of these two leaders' relationship, and that might serve as an indirect catalyst to what is set to unfold in Captain America: Civil War. Chris Hemsworth's guileless 'Thor' is ever militant, yet innocent. This movie also draws more of the previous installment's less-utilized characters, into the scopes of its spotlight. Jeremy Renner's Hawkeye, enjoys his expanded character whose interaction with other avengers, has immensely improved, and he also has some of the best jaw-dropping action sequences here. Mark Ruffalo as Hulk still smashes, he's as diffident as he is dangerous, and yet still charmingly funny. Scarlett Johanson's character, Black Widow, has been treated with bigger attention, and her presence is never less if not as strong as her male counterparts. To forget the newcomers, Taylor Johnson's Quicksilver and Elizabeth Olsen's Scarlet Witch, is totally unfair too, as these two cemented their fiery presence right at the very first battle sequence of the movie. Same can be said with Paul Bettany's Vision, whose mysterious power might be the very weapon that could propel the Avengers to winning their battle against their biggest enemy: ULTRON. James Spader's voice strikes as the perfect embodiment of the indomitable android ULTRON who is hellbent to rendering the planet to extinction. Spader has the utmost command of the character and has fueled it with utter rage and bitterness, and calm and ease when needed. You're not going to forget Sam Jackson's Nick Fury too, and the rest of his team, including Falcon. He's as effectively leading his team here when he is needed to be as he was, the first time Avengers were called to assemble. It features Andy Serkis' entry to the franchise too, and while it's brief, he manages to established a commanding presence in the movie. The film grants everybody the right amount of exposure to shine, letting both their inner fragilities and physical prowess speak volumes for who they are. Their imperfections claim pivotal share in their greatest undertaking—winning their very own internal battles so they could emerge able to save the world from the wrecking weights of annihilation.

Straightaway at the beginning, Age of Ultron throws our heroes into roaring action, drawing us immediately into a surfeit of explosive and visually-omnipotent action extravaganzas that allow every smashing, pounding, flash of beams, flight, and basically everything, assume near-impossible forms of eye-squashing spectacles. It is when all these heroes engage together in combat against their enemies, that the movie subjugates all those hungry eyes, and grasps total domination over the audience's attention, letting the awestruck reception hum along the visual drama as it extends its reach beyond imagination. It is also when all the death-defying sequences and breathtakingly choreographed action set-pieces, spin out to full throttle, that the underlying cause why this band of superheroes fight with their lives, becomes blindingly evident—humanity. This is what had put them into this circle, in the first place, and it's what they are now aiming to preserve even when they have to wrestle with death. Whedon has never deprived these characters of humanity, making each of them similar, albeit their much readily-perceived differences. This summons affection for these characters, which right away the film gathers, whenever it puts the narrative's soul into the spotlight.

AVENGERS: Age of Ultron is without fault, but too few and little that they're not even worth-noting. To be able to gather all these radical personas and bring their different worlds into one concrete universe, is already a colossal feat. Whedon proves to be capable of pushing the limits of the movie's accomplishments past that milestone, and the result is never less than monumental. The whole experience imparts an overwhelming sense of satisfaction, yet it also makes the audience hunger for more. Well, the movie lays ground-works and unleashes potential backdoors for the franchise's next chapters, and that makes everything that follows something to look forward to.

AVENGERS: AGE of ULTRON is visually enthralling as it is emotionally profound, a cinematic achievement soaring above the previously reached heights in the ever expanding universe of superhero movies. 9/10",9
Not one of the top Avengers films,10 September 2018,"One user nailed it... underwhelming.

What also really bothered me was Ultron's voice and character. Seemed too childish and immature for a villain. His humor was also cheesy.

Still a decent film, but certainly not one of my favorite Avengers films.

7/10 from me.",7
Avengers Age of Ultron is a dream come true. Great Sequel Indeed!,14 April 2015,,10
I just love Avengers Age of Ultron! Such a superb sequel.,20 April 2015,"What's the old saying? ""Talent hits a target no one else can hit; Genius hits a target no one else can see."" Well, Joss Whedon is officially a genius and the talent of this cast was evident in every scene. They all hit it out of the park. Yes, I just love Avengers Age of Ultron. This movie works on so many levels and makes you draw on absolutely all of your emotions. The last time I enjoyed a movie this much was the last time these characters assembled. Again, they managed to deliver a remarkable cool factor. What makes it extra special is following this film after all the other solo efforts from each character. I enjoyed the others films quite a bit but they all delivered something different. Winter Soldier delivered conspiracy thrills. The Iron Man trilogy factored in Tony Stark's complete dramatic arc, character flaws and all. The Dark World was pure sci-fi fantasy. Seeing them blend together in Avengers and the sparks that resulted is an extra special treat.

It all works so well and is grounded enough to carry the story and the audience through an unbelievable ride. In fact, it doesn't just fit, it's an exciting symphony and that dichotomy and difference in characters and how they interact are what makes this movie truly great. It's why Avengers stands so tall above any other franchise at the moment. Things like Transformers, Fast/Furious, and even Star Wars or Star Trek all operate with monotone restrictions. Avengers covers all angles and even multiple genres all by itself. It delivers depth of character with its fun and amazing action sequences. There's a reason why these movies make as much money as they do. They deliver a lot of everything and do so at a high quality.

Right from the beginning of the movie, where we get the all in one tracking shot, through the epic final globe smashing conclusion, everything is on go and everything delivers superb intensity and spectacle. This is going to be many many people's favorite film of 2015.",
"Great sequel, not at all disappointing",24 April 2015,"This movie was fantastic. Great action sequences, great heroes, great villains, great jokes. All around this was a great sequel. Was it as good as the first Avengers film, yes and its probably even better. Each character is given more time to develop, especially Hawkeye and Bruce Banner/The Hulk who are characters who were not very utilised in the previous film. Also I would say Hawkeye was the character this film focused on the most and nicely tied it together. The new characters Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver were also great, and the accents were not at all distracting as others had said. The Vision, was probably the coolest addition to this film and he is introduced in a very cool way and its great that he is now a part of the MCU, Paul Bettany did a great job. Ultron, the villain of this film has been getting a lot of hate. But Ultron was great in this film. he was very human, he had so many different characteristics that made him a great character. Many viewers wanted him to be menacing and scary and that's all, but all that will accomplish is another dull MCU villain. Also the jokes in this film were completely fine. None of them pulled me out of the action, I was completely into the movie this whole time. Nothing made me look away and go, why did they do that? So really just go see this movie, ignore all the haters because this is a great addition to the MCU and you wont be disappointed. Just enjoy it and try not to pick it apart.",7
Great Film. It easily fulfilled and the exceeded all of my expectations.,15 April 2015,"The humor, angst and drama are remarkable for a superhero film. In fact, most will consider them remarkable for any type of movie. I can't think of a weak moment in the film, as it is strong from beginning to end.

Anyone doubting that this entire cast (new and old) couldn't work well together or that characters would be cheated out of screen time need not worry. EVERYONE gets to shine. Downey as well as Evans are Oscar caliber good in this movie. (Setting up what has to be an amazing next installment in ""Civil War"") All the performances are straight to the point perfect. Hulk is again perfect in his CG transformation and Spader's Ultron uses his wonderful voice and mannerisms to perfection. Each new character is exquisitely cast and the old school guard has never been better. That includes RDJ as Tony Stark. We all loved what we've seen before from him and this evolution of Stark is even more intriguing. Elizabeth Olsen gives one of the best new character portrayals in recent years. People are going to want to see a LOT more of her Scarlet Witch in the future. Also, Jeremy Renner is finally given Hawkeye material worthy of his abilities and worthy of the character itself. He truly does steal more than one scene and has some of the best one-liners imaginable.

This easily fulfilled and the exceeded all of my expectations. I can't wait to see where they branch the Avengers team and concept from this point forward. There are so many great possibilities. This really is everything anyone would want in a movie. It delivers everything I had hoped to see and quite a bit that I didn't even think possible.",10
Disappointed because the name set up expectations,20 January 2016,"I tend to enjoy the Marvel movies and animated movies / TV series when I can catch them. Unfortunately I caught Next Avengers: Heroes of Tomorrow on TV once, and that, coupled with the name Age of Ultron, led me to expect something like that animated movie or Days of Future Past: that Ultron takes over and there's a desperate struggle to overthrow him. One early trailer I saw also seemed to enforce such an impression.

Unfortunately Ultron turned out to be a rather impotent villain. He's full of potential danger, but doesn't manage to realise any of that potential. The trailers made the movie look like the threat is a lot bigger than it was. Pretty much every danger in this movie is short term and thwarted without too much problem. I kept waiting for something truly dramatic to happen, but it never did. There's no Age of Ultron in this movie, not even a glimpse of it, and for me that was disappointing enough that I didn't enjoy the movie much.

There's decent action, drama and humour, it's not a badly made movie, but the villain is weak, and even the ultimate danger, the death of the human race, is less dramatic than potential subjugation, which is what most villains go for.",6

Biggest disappointment of 2015,1 April 2016,,6
Amazing.,17 April 2015,"I just want to get to the point, this movie is outstanding. This will most likely be the biggest movie of 2015. This is a great movie for those enjoy who action, suspense, and awe worthy moments. This was unbelievably better then the first and I had my doubts but of course Marvel blew me away. I can not even think of one bad thing to say honestly, Marvel knows what to do and how do to do it. If you are a Marvel fan you need to see this movie. I will admit I was a bit upset when I found out Loki/ Tom Hiddleston would not be in this one but Ultorn delivered an amazing performance as well. Get your tickets and get your friends, family, or both because you are in for a huge surprise.",10
Guardians of the Galaxy started a horrible trend,23 April 2015,,6
"Action followed by action then, surprisingly, some character development. Then some more action.",21 August 2015,"So everybody must be asking now: ""Is it worth watching more than two hours of this just to get to the obligatory Thanos end credits scene?"" and the answer is... yes. Besides making fun of War Machine - again - and completely ignoring characters like Pepper Potts and Falcon, there was nothing that bothered me tremendously about this film. Keep in mind that it is a comic book film with superheros that dress funny, though.

The villain is pretty menacing, the interaction between the Avengers goes well beyond killing enemies in each other's blind spot and the Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver addition was interesting, though kind of condescending. I mean, if they want to ban Tin-tin cartoons for racist depictions of African people, they should stop at one moment or another inventing countries with Slavic names and filling them with helpless women and children with names just as ridiculous and toy soldier police and army forces. I am just saying.

What I thought was better than I was expecting from an Avengers movie were the underlying character stories. Thanks to Scarlet Witch we see bits of our heros' histories, we get to know Hawkeye a little better and understand his role in a team of superpowered individuals, he see the romantic side of Black Widow and the Hulk... yes, you read that right... and we get to see Captain America and Tony Stark having ideological arguments that divide the team. Of course, they carry them with vibranium shield throws and energy beams, like men do... don't they?

I loved the character of The Vision, a freak hybrid between a servile AI and a full psycho AI, holding the power of an Infinity Stone and having a 3D printed body that is half alive, half vibranium. I share his view of humanity as queer pets that you have to enjoy during their short life.

What I didn't like is that they upped the ante of what the Avengers can do, just because they could. In the end this diminished the level of empathy that one can feel for superhumans like that and removed from the quality of storytelling. Also, another film in which artificial intelligence builds bodies and kills people. Why would it? Ultron's motivation was completely unexplored and his philosophy and references to Pinocchio made no sense at all. OK, it was meant to be insane, but even insanity has purpose and sense. Overall, I think the biggest problem with the film was that it had too much of a budget.

Bottom line: brainless fun, but fun nonetheless. Less humor than expected, with Ultron teasing an interesting character with his jokes, but then devolving to a classic villain in the sea of special effects that filled most of the movie. You get to know the Avengers more, as well, which was nice.",8
The best film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe so far (spoiler free),30 April 2015,"Avengers: Age of Ultron is exactly what I wanted it to be, a fine sequel with solid pacing, directing, acting, eye gouging special effects and awesome action sequences. Before going to see this film, I looked back to the greatest movie sequels ever to make a comparison, Terminator 2, The Empire Strikes Back, The Dark Knight, (I haven't seen The Godfather Part II yet), and Avengers: Age of Ultron is definitely on the same level as all of those films. My favourite film in the MCU was undeniably Guardians of the Galaxy, but I gotta say that AOU is the best Marvel movie ever since GOTG.

The cast did a fantastic job, and I literally mean each and every one of them. Robert Downey, Jr. threw it down, Chris Evans is there shining in his well-acted portrayal as Captain America, Chris Hemsworth is at his very best, Scarlett Johanson is also at her very badass best (and quite flirtatious as well I might add), Mark Ruffalo was amazing as Bruce Banner/Hulk, but Jeremy Renner stood out to me on top of all of the team. He's not my favourite Avenger, but Hawkeye was at first to me the least important guy on the team, and I thought that because he had a lack of character development in the first Avengers, but now they've done a terrific improvement on his character and they have developed him much better this time with quite an emotional core and some very good one-liners.

The newcomers, I can say, without hesitation, the same for as well. Elizabeth Olsen and Aaron-Taylor Johnson did a brilliant job as the two mutant twins. I do think that Evan Peters was a better version of Quicksilver when he played him in X-Men: Days of Future Past. Paul Bettany as the Vision was a show-stealer as well and he offered us his best in a well directed superhero movie. However, the newcomers all pale in comparison to James Spader's Ultron. I can see now why the cast and crew applauded him for his performance. Ultron was the real show stealer of the film and probably the best villain in the MCU and he is definitely up there with the greatest movie villains of all time, even reaching the same level as The Joker and Darth Vader. Whenever he's on screen, the movie sets the dark mood.

So all in all, this is one of my favourite superhero movies ever and better than the first Avengers film in my opinion. It has a well placed focus on the title characters, the Avengers and Ultron, and after that, it has an awesome set up to Phase 3.

My one problem with it is that the film wasn't as dark as the trailers suggested it would be. I just think that there should've been a little more to set the mood. It definitely does set the mood as dark as it was in Captain America: The Winter Soldier, I will say that.

Still, I strongly recommend you see this one. Do not miss it.",7
Truly a MARVEL of a movie!,23 April 2015,,10
"In character and theme much darker and more complex a sequel than its predecessor, Joss Whedon creates yet another immensely satisfying Avengers chapter",22 April 2015,"If the first 'Avengers' movie was about building the team, then this one is about tearing them apart.

If you've read the books, you'll know that Ultron's foremost purpose is to put the Avengers in the ground – which in writer-director Joss Whedon's interpretation, becomes a symbol of grand irony. After all, Ultron was Tony's idea of creating an artificial intelligence which could protect mankind and so make the Avengers obsolete, a project which he happened to be working in secret with Bruce and his personal A.I. assistant Jarvis (voiced by Paul Bettany). Unfortunately for him, Ultron has taken the obsoletion of the Avengers quite literally, and determined for himself that the only way for mankind to survive is for it to be annihilated and thereby given a chance to evolve.

That the Avengers will face Ultron and his army of replicas is a given, but what truly surprises is the twisty character-driven narrative which Whedon weaves to get to that jaw-dropping finale. You would already have heard of the high-profile additions Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen), a pair of tightly-knit Eastern European siblings whose powers of speed and mind control respectively lend their reference here as ""enhancements"" – and besides Ultron, the brother-and-sister pair become the most formidable threat to the Avengers, in particular the latter's psychic powers which she uses on Captain America, Black Widow and Thor to trigger memories of their past and face their personal demons.

While their visions leave them distracted and unsettled, the rest of the team are also forced to confront their own fears. Tony's hubris, once the driving force of his pioneering spirit, could very well be the end of the Avengers and the destruction of everything he's tried to build. Bruce loathes his alter-ego, but recognises that his powers are still a valuable addition to the team, especially in protecting Black Widow, with whom he shares a deepening romantic interest hinted at in the last movie. And freed from the shackles of Loki's spell, Hawkeye is reminded of his mortality as one with no special powers or metal suit other than being an excellent archer, beautifully portrayed in a sojourn at the halfway mark that he makes to his 'safe house' to visit his wife and kids along with the rest of his teammates to recuperate and re-group.

It is no small feat juggling so many characters in the same movie, and yet again, Whedon has pulled it off stunningly. Even though each is part of a larger team, no one fades into it; instead, Whedon lets us get to know each and every one of the Avengers intimately, so much so that you won't feel that you know them any less than you would if they each had their own standalone movie. And out of that character emphasis comes some lovely human moments that make this more soulful and poignant than its predecessor – how Black Widow coaxes the Hulk back into human form, that Hawkeye is an All- American family man when not on superhero duty, why Ultron is really Tony's darkest side in the flesh (or metal) gone amok, and fundamentally the burdens that each one of our superheroes carry as a consequence of their powers.

Besides Ultron, Whedon refuses to define any of the characters as ""good"" or ""bad""; rather, he identifies and illustrates their drives and impulses – whether is it Tony's phobia or Captain America's old- fashioned sense of duty or even Ultron's Oedipal grudge – and uses that to propel the story forward. This is ultimately how the team falls apart, going from the joviality of Thor's favourite party trick (otherwise known as ""who is fit to lift the hammer"") at the start to the infighting later on over Tony's plan to create yet another superior A.I. to defeat Ultron – which ends up in the birth of the red-faced android named Vision (Bettany in the flesh). It is also how Whedon plots the reconciliation of the Avengers with their apparent arch-nemeses Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch, no doubt laying the foundation for the next phase of the Avengers programme – and the next two-parter instalment due three years later.

Only when it comes to matching the sheer jaw-dropping spectacle of its predecessor does this sequel become a victim of its own success. Despite hopscotching across the globe from Europe to Africa to Asia and back (culminating in the fictional East European country of Sokovia where it started), Whedon never quite achieves the same feeling of 'wow' that we had watching Loki take out S.H.I.E.L.D's airborne headquarters or unleash hell from the sky onto New York City. Whedon manage to replicate that feeling of astoundment in the much- anticipated Hulk-versus-Hulkbuster sequence, but the next to follow set in and around downtown Seoul is a major disappointment for blurry CGI and bad continuity. And though he tries to replicate the exhilaration watching the whole Avengers fighting together as an entire team, Whedon doesn't quite get our hearts leaping during the final standoff against hordes of replica Ultrons.

If the finale lacks the emotional payoff of the first movie, that's also because Whedon had set himself up with a near impossible task in the first place. That probably explains why the 'Age of Ultron' is at its core a very different movie from the first 'Avengers', not just because of how our superheroes evolve in the face of imminent destruction precipitated by one of their own but also because of the complex psychological themes that Whedon explores here. His ambition is certainly admirable, but it is inevitable that those looking for the same straightforward thrills as its predecessor will be at least slightly disappointed. That said, this is still an outstanding feat by any measure, a riveting blend of intimate character moments and grand action spectacle that remains quite simply, Marvel-lous.",7
Even with high expectations it doesn't even disappoint!,20 April 2015,"Tony Stark wants to invent something that benefits mankind but instead turns out to be the one responsible for the creation of this dangerous self thinking robot, Ultron. The Avengers must assemble once again to fight this menace that wants to kill all the humans on this planet. But Ultron is powerful and the way he is presented makes you wonder how our heroes can defeat him. Just you wait and see...

What I liked best about Age of Ultron was the fact that all our favorite heroes get equal screen time to show of what they can do. Although the action scenes are great (Iron Man in the Hulkbuster versus Hulk!) the thing that really makes this movie work is the interaction between all the people involved. Stark and Banner, Banner and Black Widow, Hawkeye and Black Widow, Thor and Captain America... like in real life you can see with whom each of them get along best. It's also nice to see that Hawkeye gets a lot of screen time. He even gets the most interesting background story of the bunch. Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch make a great addition to the team (sort of) and there are a lot more cameos in the movie (although I don't think anybody spotted Lou Ferrigno!).

The movie runs about two and a half hours and that's pretty long. It could have been a little bit shorter, but overall I didn't mind. With great action scenes (pay attention to the opening action sequence in which he introduces the Avengers in one mighty shot!), nice humor, a lot of cameos and a satisfying finale writer/director Joss Whedon has everything under control and that pays of.

This year (2015) The Avengers Age of Ultron will shatter all box office records and that will be a fitting reward for giving most Marvel fans and 'normal' moviegoers this big treat. Even Pixar slipped (with Cars 2 and Brave) so everybody's waiting for Marvel to produce a real stinker. Although that day may come, The Avengers part 2 is not the movie that will be responsible for that!

Ultron was a stand up comic,23 April 2015,,7
Somewhat disappointed,13 February 2017,"I'm a big fan of Marvel and have seen the other Avengers titles, and so I went into this one with certain expectations. They weren't met.

As opposed to earlier installments, barely a few minutes seem to pass in AoU without one of the characters making what is supposed to be an amusing, throwaway remark/one-liner. There's nothing wrong with injecting a little levity into the proceedings, but in this case, I found it excessive, and detrimental both to the flow of action and to the characters and how you engage. Wisecracking is usually one character's responsibility, specifically to provide comic relief. When all the characters are doing it, it gets tired very quickly.

I found the plot to be a bit messy, perhaps because I'm a comics purist, and the introduction and treatment of several new characters here is only tangentially related, if even that, to their actual origin stories as per the comics. With apologies to James Spader, I found the portrayal of Ultron in particular to be bordering on the ridiculous, and inappropriately ""human"", as in my imaginings, Ultron was always more of a Terminator-style killing machine with tyrannical tendencies, whereas we're presented here with more of a lovable but psychotic rogue with as much dangerous charm as he has nuts and bolts. The whole effort seems to be held together by an abundance of action, new characters, and cameos from previous characters (Samuel L. Jackson, or Idris Elba) to distract from the general lack of substance.

All in all, it was 2+ hours that I don't totally regret spending, but would not see it again, or recommend it - unless it's just for the voyeuristic pleasure of seeing your favourite eye-candy protagonists in biker leathers and latex.",5
Avengers Age of Ultron Review - SPOILERS,25 April 2015,,6
Majestic Return of the Avengers,4 May 2015,"OK. So let me start off by saying that action movies are not my absolute favorite genre in the world, I do enjoy action but I dislike when a scene of action goes on so long that you forget exactly why they are fighting in the first place. Well. Avengers Return of Ultron was action packed AWESOMENESS. They knew exactly how to break up all the action with GENUINE humor (not groan worthy puns. I'm looking at you Furious Seven) and class. This movie is the whole package for EVERYONE. You have action, romance and humor. This is SURPRISINGLY better than the first one! The story line that they put together was genius and the cinematography of the final battle scene sincerely took my breath away. This is a must see for fans of action, the Avengers, but also movies! It's what action movies in the 21st century should be like! The WHOLE package.",9
Good but not excelsior,28 April 2015,"After 2 viewings of this film I found it to overall be a good movie but as a fan of the MCU found it didn't quite hit the mark as did GOTG & CA:TWS. The film delivered on cast and action but what let me down was the overall story. Unfortunately Ultron is just a cliché AI who believes humanity must die. James Spader played him brilliantly as a mirror to Tony Stark but was not as calculative or as sinister i thought he might of been. One of the strongest moments for me throughout the film was the Hulk/Widow relationship that worked well with the characters inner struggles to define and accept themselves. This chapter was a stepping stone towards broadening the MCU in terms of BP, A:IW 1&2 and TR. The dynamics of the core Avenger team worked well along side the humour, which Joss nails but his focus should have been more on the conflict between Tony and Ultron. I'd of liked more of an Empire Strikes Back approach to the film which is what i expected, but instead the film was on equal par with Avengers Assemble.",7
Almost Lives Up to the Hype,3 May 2015,"Now, before you question me about the title compared to my rating, let me clarify. This movie is absolutely fantastic; it's witty, it's action packed, and even emotional. But before you see it, you have to put aside all the hype that you have been building up for the past couple months.

I think the main reason people are disappointed about this movie is the fact that they bought into the unimaginable, unobtainable hype. This movie is hands down, better than the original Avengers, yet people are rating it worse. The only reason I can think of, is the fact that they watched the trailers, and believed that would be the beginning level of the movie. News flash, they put some of the greatest parts in the trailer to get you interested in it.

If you enjoy movies on a big scale, have great acting, great chemistry, some easter eggs for the next movie, and solid jokes, you will like this movie. If you are expecting this movie to be something like the second coming of Jesus, then you will be disappointed.",9
A Mess,29 February 2020,"The movie is just a great mess, really, its more confuse to see it, that to understand Inception. I really hope that the next one fix the falts of Ultron.",6

A Smorgasbord of Characters and Convoluted Action,22 April 2015,,7
Avengers: Age of 'Awesome',4 May 2015,"Avengers Assemble! Earth's mightiest heroes team up once again to defeat a new threat, one originally created for change. Unlike in the comics, Tony Stark creates Ultron rather than Hank Pym (Ant-Man). Tony's invention overrides it's original settings, Ultron having a mind of his own--thinking that change means the planet should be covered with metal minions and not human beings. ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" was absolutely stunning, with many great comedic jokes and moments, more character development involving some of the most secret-keeping of characters, new and old faces on screen, the element of surprise, plenty of great action and many elements from the comic books. Multiple scenes tease upcoming movies, adding to the suspension and excitement of what will happen next with one of the world's favorite super-hero teams.",10
"Whedon had an impossible task, but he pulls through and exceeds expectations.",22 April 2015,"Soon after the first Avengers film was released, I could not wait for a sequel, and finally it's here, and it's all I could have hoped for. They're back with a few new additions, and finally a worthy(my favorite villain in the comics) foe, Ultron an AI bent on destroying humanity, at the same time putting the team in despair.

I'll start with some of the nitpicks. This is very rare, but I think Age of Ultron could have used an extra 10-15 minutes. Whedon in an interview stated he cut out some back story for the twins, which I think was a mistake, I wasn't particularly fond of them in the beginning, but as the film progressed they grew on me a lot. This time around Whedon brings a butt-load of action, and better action I might add, but while in the first film there were moments that lasted too long to take a breather from the action, in Age of Ultron he doesn't allow us a moment to catch our breath too often, very sporadically.

But, he finds away to keep things interesting. Barely shorter than the first film, it's still a long film regardless and it does not feel like it. This time around Whedon allows The Avengers to be The Avengers. They're together a lot more and their dynamic and relationship is a joy to watch. The original six, Downey Jr., Evans, Hemsworth, Ruffalo, Johansson, and Renner are all fantastic. Johansson's Black Widow and Renner's Hawkeye in particular have quite an impressive arc in this film and an argument can be made that Hawkeye is the main character, there's also a brilliant, fun tongue in cheek moment he has with Scarlet Witch. Also he got the best lines in the film aside from James Spader who by the way is an excellent villain.

Ultron in this film has a personality. He is a scene stealer and commands the screen every time he's in it. He's got some humor, but I would have liked more menace within him. There are two moments where he became very threatening, and the film could have used a bit more. Although his plan for destruction is quite impactful and quite intimidating, he sorta feels lost, as do some of the characters because the film is so saturated and overstuffed to a degree.

I'd also like to mention that Samuel L. Jackson and Cobie Smulders serve their roles well, but in a populated film like this they're roles are obviously reduced a bit, and to my surprise Don Cheadle's War Machine finally gets some action, despite it being small.

The new additions Elizabeth Olsen, Aaron Johnson, and Paul Bettany are solid and only bring extra flare into the film's ingredients. Scarlet Witch is quite well realized, a little more than Quicksilver I might I add, and she is fun to watch and causes some inner damage to the team. Speaking of Quicksilver, Whedon wisely tries not to match or outdo the X-Men Quicksilver, and in doing so he's more grounded and a little more developed than Singer's, who just used him for an impressive sequence. Paul Bettany's Vision is also another scene stealer. He was incredible in the film, and as a last minute surprise he does not disappoint. Vision is arguably one of my favorite characters growing up and Whedon works him into the film the way I'd hope it be. Kudos to Whedon.

I mentioned the action before in my nitpicks, but the action here is top notch and Whedon finds a way to keep you focused. A lot of teamwork is involved in almost every action set piece and you feel what's at stake as the team also takes cue to actually save civilians. It's just a fireworks of action displayed on screen and the scale of it is so very impressive. Hulkbuster vs Hulk in particular is a standout sequence, as does everything that has to do with Vision. But aside from the action, Whedon manages to juggle every single character and somehow make them as relevant as they can be, some obviously more than others, but it's just amazing to see it all unfold. He understands these characters as the heavy moments work well and he never forgets the heroes' humanity. There are also hints to films in the future, but they don't saturate the main plot, but enough to keep you aware.

Joss Whedon had an incredible challenge to make a sequel to the first film. I think one can argue that the novelty wore off a bit because in the first film, it was something that was never been seen before and as it was released it was, and I use the term ""done already,"" and going into this sequel, it won't be able to recapture that magic of the first because ""it's been done already.""

I know I sound like I'm fanboying, and that's because I am(no apologizes), but if you overlook all that, the film is as good as it gets. It's almost impossible to make a movie like this and not have it feel repetitive. Not to mention, it's impossible to have so many characters and have a completely satisfying characterization for all of them, and I think in the hands of another filmmaker who not only writes, but also directs would more or less likely fail.

Joss got the job done, but one can notice corporate meddling was taken place, as it is a big crowd drawing film for everyone. I think the Russo's and the writing team of Markus and McFeely are the prefect candidates to take over the glorious Avenger films. I believe they nail the darker tone a lot better than anyone else. The film has no end-credits stinger, but stick around for the mid-credit scene. It's so good.

Felt so bland,23 April 2015,"Everything seems so bland. The constant jibe of who gets the last word in seems forced, predictable and acts like an edit for the next scene. Coming out of the screening, there is not one scene or moment that i feel that i can walk away with in awe.

The romantic angle that was introduced lack chemistry. From out of nowhere, the characters involved suddenly had an interest for one another? Without any build up of it in past movies nor in this one, it just felt empty.

Camera angles that were purposefully shot for the intentional thrill of 3D is like any other angles used in any other 3D-movie-going-experience. I wonder when will this gimmick/trend go away.

All in all...it is still watchable. It just left a disdain taste of yet another repetition of the Marvel formula. Age of Ultron neither has the quality and magic of both Guardians of the Galaxy or Captain America Winter Soldier had.",3
"It's bigger, darker, and it's not the best Marvel movie. But it's still fun!",3 May 2015,,7
Better then the first!,14 April 2015,"Avengers age of Ultron is by far the best Marvel movie to date. It has all the elements of the first movie, but steps it up in the action, character and dialog. I went into this movie with very unrealistically high expectations. So when I saw this movie, I was very worried but excited.

All the cast from the previous Avengers movie all reprise their roles. Robert Downey Juinor was amazing as Ironman. Chris Evans and Chris Hemsworth were both great as Captain America and the mighty Thor. Scarlett Johanson was brilliant as Black Widow and was even more bad-ass in this movie, than any of her other films. Her role was substantially bigger this time around. This can also be said about Hawkeye, who's role was way bigger in this movie. In fact, Hawkeye even has some of the best lines and the best action sequences. Mark ruffilo was once again amazing as Hulk and Bruce Banner. The one character that stole the show, would be James Spader. He embodies an evil AI robot perfectly. He can be really calm and yet menacing and sometimes he can be full of rage and anger. Aron Taylor Johnson and Elisibeth Olsin are also a great new edition to the marvel universe. The scarlet Witch character has a big part in the film also.

The action has been dialed up and the set pieces are bigger and better. The cgi can seem a little off at times, but other than that, it looks fantastic.

The movie also spends time on the relationships and past of some characters, which leads to some great character moments. This is much more emotional, than the first movie. I would defiantly say that this movie is better than the first Avengers Movie!",8
Very disjointed,20 July 2015,"What bothers me most about Age of Ultron is that it can't decide on what kind of tone it wants to set. Some of the old Marvel spirit that balances fun with character arcs and themes is struck here, but a lot of the time, this film is just depressing too. The themes get quite dark, almost DC dark at times, and that worries me, 'cause I think the Marvel movies have done a better job with the whole comic-book movie thing than DC have. Hope this is not a sign of things to come.

Furthermore, all plot and character development seems to have been thrown out the window. The first Avengers worked because it was the perfect melting pot for all of these characters' stories and character development at the time. Captain America was still getting used to life in the 21st century, and of course Loki and Thor's story was in direct continuation to the movie Thor. In Age of Ultron, the same attempt at character and story unity is just messy. I thought Steve Rogers (and Falcon) was going to search for Bucky Barnes, did he just put that on hold? On the whole, the Cap was underused in this movie, as was Thor (my two faves). And the whole romance thing with Natasha and Bruce only works because of the wonderful performances by Scarlett Johansson and Mark Ruffalo. These characters have never shown the slightest bit of chemistry together before, now suddenly we're told that they have a crush on each other. After a movie where the Cap and Romanoff had a lot of chemistry together. Sure.

Also, maybe it's just me, but I just didn't care as much about the fictional city, because, well, it's fictional. We've already established that these characters live in a world tangent to our own, and Loki's invasion on Manhattan felt far more visceral to the audience 'cause we could relate to it. Not setting the final battle in an actual Eastern European location really damaged my investment in it. I really, really like Ultron as a character, though, and his personality kept me excited. But how he and Jarvis were connected might've gone over the heads of many in the audience.

You will not walk away from this film all energized like after the first Avengers. Instead, you'll feel like this is the end of an era. Pros to Elizabeth Olsen for a great character, but as a Marvel movie, Age of Ultron is messy to say the least.",6
Avengers assemble once again!!!,18 April 2015,"Let's just get straight to point here, Avengers Age of Ultron is the best marvel movie to date. You can make a strong argument for it being the best superhero movie of all time. Yes it's really that good.

The plot line was very intriguing. It was far from the cliché superhero story. The script was funny and very witty. Joss Whedon did a wonderful job, it's a shame that he won't be directing the next 2 avengers films. The only upside is that he will be still there as a producer for phase 3 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. This story really sets up phase 3 and one of the most anticipated movies of 2016, Captain America: Civil War. My one regret in terms of the story is that it could be slightly longer, even though the entire film ran smoothly. I would have still liked to see more of the movie, I guess we will have to wait for the DVD release to see some extra scenes.

All the actors, unsurprisingly, played their roles superbly. Robert Downey jr again played the genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist, which we all love. This performance just adds to the argument that he is Iron Man. Chris Evan always brings a sense of honesty and heart to the role of Captain America. Scarlet Johansson again showed us that a male isn't the only one who can be a badass that young boys look up to. Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo, Samuel L Jackson, Jeremy Renner, Cobie Smulders, Don Cheadle and Anthony Mackie all reprised their roles wonderfully and each one of them added an extra dimension to their character. The newcomers Thomas Kretschmann, Andy Serkis, Elizabeth Olsen and Aaron Taylor-Johnson were all great additions to the already extremely talented and lively cast. The newcomer that really gave the strongest performance was clearly James Spader. His intimidating robotic voice really brought the character to life and added sense of realism, in an otherwise unbelievable character. He brought our future fears (from terminator) of an AI trying to wipe out humanity. Marvel are not known for their memorable super villains, in fact they're known for the opposite of this, but this villain is up there with Loki, Ultron is one of the more terrifying and surprisingly relatable/understandable villains in the MCU. However Paul Bettany's performance as the vision stole the show. He took the spotlight for every scene that he was in and I can't wait to see him again. The cast really gel well as a unit and you'll be thinking that these actors grew up with each other, after you've seen the movie. The chemistry between everyone holds the film together.

The action in the movie, let's just make this quick, was mind blowing. For anyone who's seen the trailers, you will already know that the action shown was amazing. For any of you that think that they've showed too much or every action piece, from the movie, in the trailers, you couldn't be more wrong. When you watch the movie you'll notice that the action scenes are orchestrated beautifully and that every character has upped their game since the last time we saw them on screen, especially Captain America. This is a big budget movie and this is clearly shown in the stunts and the action sequences. The movie was shot all over the world this time and that helps to show that these group of people don't just fight for one nation but the world. The locations were beautiful and i will always prefer a real natural set over a green screen.

This movie was a fantastic treat to watch and it's really a shame that this movie wasn't longer, so that we could all enjoy it for 20-30 minutes more. I had high expectations coming into the theatre and when I left, I was more than satisfied. This movie will be enjoyed by people of all ages, it's got cool action for the kids and the plot is more than interesting enough to hold the attention of the adults. This movie delivers on all levels and can be considered as one of the best, if not the best movie of all time. It's clearly the best movie in the past few years. P.S. Stay for after the movie ends (mid-credits) for a treat for phase 3.

"How is this movie an 8.0, when most reviews are bad?? How is that even possible??",2 May 2015,"For those of us who were disappointed with this movie, and judging by most of the reviewers here (who are not fake), a lot of us were disappointed I was semi entertained but to me being marginally entertained is NOT good enough for a movie of this caliber that costs 1/4 of a billion dollars to make!

I guess I expected more from this movie. The trailer made it seem like it was going to be a home run but this barely got to first base. This was more like the last transformers movie, mindless, stupid action that catered to 15 year olds. The script was bad, WAY TOO MANY one liners(most were not funny at all), way too many characters and not enough explanation, and that's just the start of it, I could go on and on. This was just an overall disappointment that certainly should not be a 8.0, not even close. Even most of the reviewers here that gave it a 8, 9, or 10 complained in their review about a lot of things. And they still gave it a very high score? Doesn't make sense, so I am doing the only thing I can which to to tell all my friends how horrible this movie was and never purchase the DVD.

Sorry Marvel and Disney but you better start doing a whole lot better or you will not be getting any more money from me! The people have spoken, we expect better next time!!",7
ICONIC,19 January 2021,"It is a brilliant movie. It has some iconic scenes, the action sequences are awesome, the dialogues are very nicely written. I would say it is not as good as the other avengers but still it is pretty cool.",8
I waited all this time......for this? Falls a bit short.,2 May 2015,"I love the original Avengers movie.....even though it lacked substance.....it was exciting! Everyone in the theater....young and old.....were on the edge of their seats...laughing.....gasping.....and rooting for their favorite hero(s)....usually the Hulk.

In Age of Ultron, the Theater was quiet for the most part....with the occasional giggle. (Night and day in comparison)

Ultron.....was formidable.....but after reading the comics.....and even watching the Avengers Assemble cartoon.....he seemed weak in comparison. Ultron....always seemed nearly indestructible.....and destroyed so much in his path. The movie portrayed him as a cynical psychopath with a sense of humor at times.

The heroes were portrayed well, as usual, except my favorite character....the Hulk. Why are you still portraying him as some Ape?? WTF?? The Hulk can talk ya know!? The Recent animations such as Avengers Assemble and Earth Mightiest Heroes have the Hulk and Thor portrayed on point...why can't the live action get it?! Evolve him already....and let the Hulk and Thor Spar and talk crap to each other!!

Anyway....bottom line....the Avengers was solid.......but was it worth the wait after three years? No.....not really. I expected so much more. And I gotta add.......if the Hulk is not in the next Avengers movie for what ever reason.....I am done. I won't watch anymore.

PS.....it is past due time for a damn Hulk movie. His first if you will. We all know this!",6
Avengers re-assemble.,24 April 2015,"Avengers:Age of Ultron my just be the best film of 2015 it started off great with a lot of action. Why I think this is the best superhero sequel ever.

Okay first thing this film is action packed there is a lot more action than the first one so basically the story is still there but the action literally takes over.

Second thing is the Hulkbuster now you may be thinking is it as awesome as it looks on the trailer the answer is yes...it is a lot more awesome than on the trailer and plus that action sequence goes on for quite some time.

Third thing Ultron now Ultron may have been toned down to how he was in the comics but in this film he is still as malevolent and vicious as ever but with limits obviously with it being PG-13. Ultron in this film is played by James Spader and he doesn't lack at all you can still tell that Ultron is one of the most dangerous villain The Avengers have ever faced.

Fourth thing the plot the film this time doesn't rely too much on it's story it's more the action that builds the film obviously there is still a story and it's a very good one there are some bits where the film slows down for it but that is really what a superhero film is about especially generation, when we rely on origin stories in superhero films.

Fifth and final thing does it feel like too much Disney? the answer for that question is no it doesn't see the first film really felt like it was too much Disney but in this film it's a lot darker than the first film because you see some of The Avengers literally feel pain. Plus the first film was more of a full on introduction to The Avengers and what they do. This film is far from Disney now and well in that case that's better I did love the first film too.

If you are a superhero fan and loved Ultron in the comics then you are going to love him even more in the film. This film was worth every penny and I think that well mainly superhero fans should go see this movie don't wait for it to come out on DVD just go see because it is amazing and is far better than the first. 8/10 must see superhero film.",8
Movies are meaningless,23 April 2015,"Superheroes fight robots controlled by a super A.I. Some of the characters have minimal story arcs. Trademark Joss Whedon quips are plentiful. Surprises are not.

A film made to appeal to a mass audience that enjoys action and super heroes, it follows a formula that has been proved successful. The execution is fine, but characters lack humanity that made Guardians of the Galaxy enjoyable by comparison despite its atrocious plot.

The obvious culprit is having too many heroes. A large number of characters results in a lack of focus. We are only given glimpses of character development. The truth is that this concept would be best enjoyed as a a series, and not as a film. That's probably what the comic books are for.

Read them, or watch the Firefly series instead. Those who absolutely want to see a big dumb super hero action film should watch Guardians of the Galaxy first, but Avengers: Age of Ultron fits that description too.",6
No one was more disappointed than me,1 May 2015,"It hurts to rate this so poorly, but it certainly deserves the low marks. There were so many things that ruined this movie for me.

1) The Storytelling - Or lack thereof. There was not a compelling story to be told here. Ultron wants to blow up the world, the Avengers try to stop him. That's all the audience ever really knows about this story and it felt flat and unfulfilling.

2) Plot? - The movie opens with our heroes in the middle of a battle for reasons that are largely unimportant. That pretty much sums up this whole film

3) The Love Interest - Totally underdeveloped. We're basically told by the script writer that these two people are in love, but never are we SHOWN that they're falling in love. It rang completely hollow.

4) The Humor - There were WAY too many jokes in this movie, and that wouldn't have been all that bad if so many of them weren't eye rollers. Many of them left me groaning.

5) Ultron - This guy appears out of nowhere and is woefully underdeveloped. Plus, he's supposed to be some kind of AI but he's constantly cracking off stupid one-liners and making facial expressions that I thought were inconsistent with what and who he was supposed to be.

6) Character Overload - There were WAY too many characters to do any of them any justice. I would have liked the film to focus on a smaller group of characters and their relationships with one another, instead, we got a who's who of the entire Marvel universe leaving a lot to be desired.

I could go on, but my heart is still aching and I don't want to talk about it anymore. I see that a lot of people liked it and I'm happy that they did. I only wish it hadn't been such a colossal disappointment for me.",5
Well... It was Okay...,1 May 2015,"I've gone to all the Marvel movies since Thor at the midnight showing, normally they grab my attention and keep it the entire time through so the decision to stay up until 3 am was not in vein.

The movie was okay, we all knew the movie was going to be darker, the characters were going to be in a different place because of the movies since the last Avengers. But what's fun about these movies is that they have a lot of heart. It's the little guy going after Goliath... Even if the little guy is a Greek god... Anyways the movie, because of everything the Avengers experience previously was missing that ""Go Team Go"" person, that Heart that it has always had. Captain America normally brought that but the character had gone through so much by the time the movie started, it was just lackluster. The guy that put Tony in his place last movie died, is now alive, and has his own TV show, a lot of the stuff I just went ""Coulson would have tazed him and would be watching super nanny while he's drooling on the floor right now.."".. A new character brought back the balance by the end of the movie but the imbalance was very apparent

I was just so pumped after watching Agents of Shield, catching up all last week, finished the last episode right before going to the movie, that it was just a kind of let down. Definitely worth the extra money in 3d. Only mid credits scene (Even though there was a great opportunity for an end scene that Joss didn't take and I was kind of disappointed over. I didn't give any spoilers, was very careful about it... But catch it in the movie theater because I don't think I'm going to own this one on Blu-Ray",6
Worthy of Thor's hammer!,4 May 2015,"Even up to this day, I regret not seeing The Avengers in theaters when it came out! I'm in love with the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Iron Man, Captain America and the Guardians of the Galaxy... Just writing down the titles gets me excited. The Avengers would be the culmination of all these epic superheroes! And by god it was! It was clever, it was fast, it was epic, it was funny, it was awesome! The Avengers set the bar at such a level, the curse of bad sequels was bound to pop up its nasty head. Well, with great pleasure, I can say it hasn't. Avengers: Age of Ultron (without ""The"" for some reason) is so much fun it's crazy. The action is quick, epic and on point. The teamwork is so awesome: just think about combining Cap's shield and Thor's hammer and let your imagination run wild. That's what the creators of AOU did with the action scenes: just let their creativity flow and use these amazing super abilities and just mix and mash them together to create some epic visuals.

The story is quite interesting: Tony Stark wants to create a robotic army of peacekeepers to take over from the Avengers and make them no longer needed. This backfires when his creation Ultron activates and his A.I. concludes that humanity's extinction is the only way to ensure peace on earth. It's interesting to see the cracks develop within the team. The twin who were teased at the end of The Winter Soldier come to the scene and start stirring up trouble. I was so happy to see Hawk Eye shine in the flick. In part one he was just a stool for the freaking awesome Loki for most of the film but now he gets so much more to do and he's just such a lovable character!

Visually, Age of Ultron is up to par with previous Marvel movies. It looks great, especially the climax of the movie is just a joy to watch.

I had some gripes with the film though. For starters I found it quite odd to see Iron Man just doing his thing when it wasn't explained how he came back from his retirement after Iron Man 3. I'm glad he's back but some info would be nice. Secondly there's a romance which feels out of place because it wasn't earned in previous movies. It kind of feels forced and out of the blue.

The music is epic and grand. The Avengers theme is back and it's awesome!

Summary: Fun and epic sequel with minor gripes.",8
Whedon Unleashes Our Inner Nerd,23 April 2015,"We all knew Joss Whedon faced an impossible task with 'Avengers: Age of Ultron'. To not only craft a sequel that was as great as 'The Avengers', but one which beats the competition without question. Needless to say, Whedon succeeds marvellously. You know you are in for a film of magnificence, when the opening prologue bests its predecessor in every conceivable way.

The Avengers are a powerful team. Yet they will inevitably meet their doom, one day or another. Tony Stark knows this better than anyone. He confides in Bruce Banner (AKA the Hulk), that the Avengers need an end game, a way out from their super heroic deeds. Together they create the thing that they dread ""Ultronin the flesh"". Ultron is an artificial intelligence system, who is created with the sole intention of making the world safe; this is because the Avengers cannot protect the world forever. Once Ultron questions his creator and rebels against him, he believes that a better world is one which The Avengers do not inhabit. Ultron teams up with brother and sister duo; Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch to destroy the team, once and for all.

The cast for 'Avengers: Age of Ultron' is impeccable, with old friends and new foes alike. The heroes are Iron Man (a witty Robert Downey Jr.), the Hulk (the subtle Mark Ruffalo), Thor (a god-like Chris Hemsworth) and Captain America (a righteous Chris Evans.) Joining them are assassins Hawkeye (a keen Jeremy Renner) and Black Widow (an emotional Scarlett Johansson.) On the opposing side are Scarlet Witch (an illuminating Elizabeth Olsen) and Quicksilver (a supersonic Aaron Taylor-Johnson.) The big baddie with global domination on his mind every waking minute is Ultron. He is voiced by James Spader, who oozes determination, power and intimidation. The key thing of note about Ultron is that he is intelligent and resourceful, not a lumbering henchman with dumb schemes. Ultron has a plan, one which he does not entirely divulge to The Avengers. It's so good to not be bombarded by exposition, which is far too present in the X-Men franchise. Avengers could teach it a thing or two.

The action set pieces have been thoroughly thought out; this gave me the impression that the production and animation team left nothing up to chance. The first fifteen minutes feature enough excitement on their own to put Bond out of business for good. We are introduced in this sequence to all the major players and briefly glimpse Ultron's final form. Furthermore, the fight that sees Iron Man don the Hulk Buster Armour in an attempt to stop an out of control Hulk from causing higher levels of chaos is breath taking. I literally lost my mind and I am certain that any other audience member will as well.

Joss Whedon excels not just at action, but with the dialogue and characters. Each and every person on screen feels fully formed and defined. This time there is no weak link glaringly present. Hawkeye was underutilised in 'The Avengers', however in 'Age of Ultron' we care more about him. This is because we discover many secrets to his and other character's pasts. The most intriguing of which is the character of Natasha Romanoff (Black Widow) whom sees a glimpse of how she became an assassin and her vulnerability; this gives her feeling, thus in the process making her seem less two dimensional than she arguably was before.

The lines are witty and still retain emotion. 'Age of Ultron' has a heart that the majority of comic book films can only aspire to. Tony Stark is extremely funny, able to provide laughs amid the ongoing destruction. Bruce Banner is thoughtful, wondering if the Hulk is the darker side of his personality. Thor says the wrong thing frequently that provokes the enemy and Captain America is the soul of the film, bringing the heroes to fight together against Ultron in the climactic, unbelievable battle, which left me lost for words. I have rarely experienced such a feeling and 'Age of Ultron' had me regularly gasping, cheering and crying. Bless Joss Whedon who brings heart, humour and soul to The Avengers. I am left utterly speechless and cannot imagine regaining this feeling until 'Avengers: Infinity War Part I' which will be released in 2018.

As cinematographer Ben Davis can do no wrong. Having previously photographed 'Guardians of the Galaxy', it is clear that with 'Age of Ultron' he is relaxed and in his element. No praise I could give him would be sufficient.

The score composed by Danny Elfman and Brian Tyler is what fan boys like me; hear in their heads, when imagining their favourite heroes being brought to life. I'm still humming the theme tune and will be buying the soundtrack upon its release. What pleased me the most about the score was the inclusion of Alan Silvestri's Avengers theme, what a tremendous homage indeed.

Mightier than Thor's hammer, funnier than Stark's trademark wit and smarter than Banner's brain; 'Avengers: Age of Ultron' is a comic book film that rules above all others.",7
Amazing movie ! (No spoilers),5 May 2015,"I was reading some of the post and seemed very surprised at the few low ratings , I know you can't please everyone. All of the fighting scenes were spectacular I never got bored , even through the slower parts I enjoyed the whole movie. I think that the humor in it was great , and realistic . You get that much testosterone in a group everyone will try to one up everyone else, In real life as well. I saw it in iMax(the huge screens) 3D , so that definitely added to the excitement , I don't go see movies any more in regular screen ever since imax 3D. I strongly recommend going to see it like that ! It is an unforgettable experience. Also on a side note guys that get disappointed I don't feel bad for because just like with everything in life if you expect something a certain way and it doesn't meet your expectations you are going to get let down ! But if you have none or at the very least lower your expectations you will see how much of a difference it is . Go in with an open mind , don't be so closed minded people. Just saying !",10
It's good enough,15 September 2022,,7
Underrated,16 January 2021,I enjoy this one more than the first one both 10/10 movies. I don't understand the hate its not the best MCU film or even the best Avengers film but it definitely isn't as bad as everyone says it is.,10
Interesting Social Commentary Vailed in a Bigger Popcorn Movie than the First,4 March 2022,"This is a movie that I saw once in prep to go see another of the Avengers movies in the theater. Jaime and I watched this on our way to seeing Infinity War and Endgame as part of the Internet Movie Database poster we are working through.

Where I want to start is that I didn't remember a lot about this movie. What works here is the villain of Ultron. In the beginning, our crew gets the staff that belonged to Loki. It is the one that Thanos gave to him. Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) gets the idea that they can use it to create an Artificial Intelligence named Ultron. He is helped by Bruce Banner/Hulk (Mark Ruffalo). The plan is to not need the Avengers by creating this. What happens is creating a being that wants to wipe out humanity after being on the internet.

I'm shocked that I didn't remember more. This one is setting the stage for a lot of movies by referencing Wakanda, introducing Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) and Vision (Paul Bettany). We are also getting interesting questions and answers that have been developed previously in Captain America movies. I've realized that when they're looking at more social issues, you have me on board.

This is another fun one. It has some moments where it is too CGI heavy. There's not a lot you can do though. You have to continuously raise the stakes like we get here. Despite the huge cast, I think they balance it well. The movie is two and half hours so there is that. It does move at a good clip though for sure.

My Rating: 7.5 out of 10.",7
A great follow up; but two major problems,29 April 2015,"My first impression of Age of Ultron is that it's a great film. The action scenes are spectacularly done. The interactions between characters, except for a few, are wonderful. And, needless to say, we get a fantastic villain out of James Spader playing Ultron.

But there were two things I found wrong. The first is the beginning. While we were given this good prologue to explain the setup of the main story, it was followed up with yet more exposition to start the main story and lengthy party sequence with too many nameless extras (Stan Lee's cameo being the only exception) that dragged on. This is all before Ultron even begins to function, and we're already twenty to thirty minutes into the film.

The second is the romantic relationship between Hulk and Black Widow. Alright, I confess. I am a Steve Rogers/Natasha Romanoff fan. But this pairup was so badly mishandled. There is no leadup to it; it just comes out of nowhere. At least with Cap and Hawkeye, there was chemistry to found on.

Besides these two things however, I would go as far to say that this movie is so well done that it could practically be The Empire Strikes Back of Avengers movies. Instead of being focused on the action like the first Avengers film was, Age of Ultron focused more on the characters and their developments as they deal with the situations they are being put through, or putting themselves into in some cases. I won't say anymore as I will spoil the film if I do. Go to the cinema and see it for yourself.",8
A stepping stone,29 January 2023,,7
Even Worse Than The First One,4 September 2021,"All sorts of trash gets rated above 7 on here.

Two and a half hours of characters quipping, undermining any sense of tension or threat. Then again, when the main villain is also a wisecracker, it kind of fits.

Joss Whedon is a visually illiterate director and the most overrated screenwriter working in Hollywood. The endless and relentless quips do not a good dialogue make. He should've practiced directing between 2012 and 2014. Maybe he could have delivered, at least a competently made movie.

Whedon should stick to TV. It's clearly where he belongs.",2
The best of Age of Ultron,7 December 2020,,7
Another Monumental Marvel Movie!,29 April 2015,"The Avengers assemble once again go up against a new corrupt, A.I. Ultron (James Spader). As the troupe pursue their mission, we're given a deeper understanding of our favorite super heroes.

There are not enough words in the world to express how happy I am. As a Marvel fan, this film showcases some of my favorite comic book characters together in one plot line in a bigger and better way. When you are dealing with a sequel, as a filmmaker, you're pretty much trying to top yourself. Thankfully, the filmmakers have out done themselves here. We're given a superior conflict, more characters and action beyond epic proportions.

I love this movie not only because it's a phenomenal Marvel film, but also an outstanding film in general. A movie is supposed to grab the audience and transport them to a universe with characters that not only we look up to but also identify with. Marvel has successfully created this reality. Every time I see a Marvel logo on a movie poster I'm excited to be sent back, once again, into their universe.

Marvel is a genius entertainment company because they establish their characters in previous films. The Avengers are the protagonist. Every character is given their moment in the lime light but, they are not the main focus. They all share the screen and have their own personal conflict, yet they respond as team. That is not to say that there is no character development, there is. Former story lines help save time so that the writers can focus on perfecting the current story. This also leads to much stronger relationships between the characters.

For people who have no history with Marvel films, I suggest that you see some of the previous films that feature the Avengers. The reason is that you may miss a connection with the characters that can be resolved by watching previous films. Although you will enjoy the action and story even without seeing the previous films, the inside jokes and interactions between characters become funnier when you understand the past.

The action in this film is awesome! The word awesome is a very primitive word, but it explains everything. While I love to go to the movies and appreciate storytelling and 3 dimensional characters, there are times when I just want to see things go boom! Every Avenger, with his or her different abilities, works together and kicks butt. An example of this is when Thor hits Captain America's shield and causes a devastating explosion. You have to see it to believe it.

My favorite character is, Vision (Paul Bettany) an android created by Ultron. Bettany is originally the voice of J.A.R.V.I.S., Tony Stark's (Robert Downey, Jr.) A.I. companion. Bettany uses his fantastic voice to create Vision. I was excited when I heard he was going to be a new addition to the Avengers team. Not only is the acting and personality spot on, but the costume design is beautiful.

There are so many scenes that I adore, but my favorite is when the Avengers, ""get acquainted"" with Vision for the first time. This is the second A.I. the group has encountered and they're unsure if they can trust him. Vision is uncertain himself and gives a speech on why it doesn't matter because they all want to stop Ultron. At the end of his speech there is a comedic pay-off that shows which side Vision is truly on.

The moral of the film is, ""The way to peace is not destruction."" Ultron is built for one reason - to create peace in our time. Ultron is confused on how to fulfill that mission and believes the only way to achieve his goal is to wipe out the human race and start over. However, Ultron underestimates the soul of man.

I give this 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it to 11- to 18 year- olds. There is language and intense action that younger kids might not be able to handle. Check out this film in theaters May 1 and remember, a true Marvel fan stays to the end of the credits.

Lacking the magic spark,23 April 2015,"This film tells the story of the avengers coming together to fight against Ultron, the artificial intelligence with a mechanical body form. Ultron is so powerful that the avengers finally meet their mighty adversary.

I had super high hopes for ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"", but I am quite disappointed by it. Don't get me wrong, it is still a good film. It begins with a real good fight scene in the forest. Then, there's a lot if taking, talking and more talking. That gets boring. I'm not really there to watch someone having a secret family stashed away, and I am not in the mood to care about anyone's love life. I just wanna watch the superheros fight in epic, breath taking battles that destroy cities like there's no tomorrow. Though such a scene does happen in the end, there's no saving the film. The fact that new characters spring up without even introducing the name is a little annoying as well. Overall, it is a brain off blockbuster, but a lacklustre one when compared to the other Marvel movies.",

It's meant to save the world but things go wrong and now they have to get every avenger and more people to stop Ultron. First off, Age Of Ultron was amazing and blew the first avengers out of the water. Everything was more fun, and raised the stakes to a whole another level. Now, there are some parts of the movie that felt not needed for this movie but you know that it will become a bigger piece in the MCU. What makes age of Ultron great as the first one is seeing all the avengers together. The old cast is great as before and with the addition of the new characters, it's just better. Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch were great additions to the MCU. The one person who stole the whole movie was Hawkeye. He had a lot more screen time and much more character development.

"Honest Review: Good Film, But Inferior Sequel",1 May 2015,"After Tony Stark unleashes a robotic madman he and the team of Avengers will Have to destroy him and all his counterparts as Ultron plans to destroy all of humankind in this newest Avengers Film.

I must say, in the past few days I was extremely hyped up about the film. After the last superhero film Guardians of The Galaxy, I hoped the Avengers brought something better. It did, but it is an inferior sequel.

I will try to keep this review Spoiler Free also since I don't want to ruin any of the hype to people who haven't seen it.

The Villain Ultron (James Spader) is a dang great villain. He is more of a gentleman of a villain than Loki was, but dang, Ultron looks cool, sounds cool, acts cool, it's a good villain.

Other characters appear as well as Vision, Quicksilver, Scarlet Witch and some others return like The Falcon (But only for two appearances) which is great to see. The Stan Lee Cameo was also funny as always.

The Main Characters were great also. Bruce and Natasha get more development and we find out something great about Hawkeye Also. The performances by Evans, Downey, Hemsworth, Ruffalo, Spader, Taylor Johnson are all good and it's nice to see a bit more variety in characters.

The visuals are what you expect. Standard level CGI big effects that sometimes can look outstanding but most of the time are nothing new. The climax is pretty good with the visuals but overall the visuals ain't nothing to howl for.

The Story, Meh. It could have used a bit more originality. We have seen the whole villain motivation before but the film does a good job with how it's done.

If you are expecting another post credits scene, don't expect it here, there is a mid credits scene which I will not reveal but prepare to be disappointed when there is nothing after the credits.

Sorry If the review was not useful but I feel like I don't need to explain much of what has already been said. The audience I was with gasped at this one particular part of the film, but you will have to see what it is. Avengers Age Of Ultron is a inferior sequel in the fact that it's a cookie cutter been there done that formula. But hopefully for Infinity War, there will be something fresh and new.

"Has energy to distract, but little substance to engage",26 September 2015,"I am as much to blame as anyone for the rash of superhero films doing the rounds, since I do generally enjoy them as very expensive productions, with high energy, humor, and action. Essentially they are easy to watch and generally entertaining. Looking ahead to future years, more of the standalone films will continue to get sequels, while generally also they all start to overlap and involve each other – in particular in the two-part Infinity Wars coming in about 3 years. On the basis of Age of Ultron though, this is perhaps not too much to get excited about, because the film is not a great deal to get excited about.

In terms of action, it looks great and has lots of movement and special effects to distract and entertain; but this is probably not enough for a film running over two hours long. The plot also holds out a lot with its additional characters and relationships, as well as morality questions about Stark and the Avengers themselves. If any of this was meant to play out to be something interesting, it really doesn't have the space or time to do so, and essentially the new characters are fairly one-dimensional, while the established characters generally get by on the fact that most viewers will have had a whole film or two to get to know them already. As it is the plot doesn't really hold out much of interest, and the very busy film and action sequences do not allow much room for the film to really relax. There are some good lines in here, dramatic and comedic, but mostly the film feels too full to be able to handle doing what it wants.

Those who appreciate the bigger picture of the Marvel Universe probably love all the connections and in-jokes, and small mentions/sightings of familiar characters; however for the casual viewer it doesn't work as well. It remains too expensively big to be a 'bad' film, and I found the energy and action and noise to be a distracting way to pass an evening without having to tax my brain too much, but it is to the detriment of the film that all that energy does not have the substance to really match it.",
Disappointed,13 January 2016,"One of the most disappointing movie i have seen last year, cartoon-ish villain and lackluster humor. I was more interested to see a villain like Thanos than Ultron but gave it a try anyway. Special effects seems to fail especially during the use of digital doubles.The heroes cracking jokes in the middle of a battlefield, and then there is Quicksilver why kill off a character who had such a potential.

I hope they will bring better villains to the forefront and not take viewer for granted in the future installments.

I am giving it the lowest possible rating just so Marvel would get the message and improve next time and make a film like ""The Avengers"".",6
This is why you pay the ticket!,7 May 2015,"Well, I watched it last night and I am still amazed and thinking about it! Truly one of the greatest marvel movies. I read some of the negative reviews from other users and I have to say that I don't understand them. Sometimes it feels like they paid a ticket to see a marvel movie, and then they expected some kind of Oscar winning performance and some deep and meaningful life-inspiring story. No. That's not it. If you expect that, look for another movie.

For me, this kind of movies is like having single-flavor smoothies, like lemon or orange or strawberry, and then, one day a guy comes and says, ""do you want them all in one?"". That's actually it. Iron man, Thor, Hulk and Captain America, some very successful characters, all-in-one! What more can you ask for?

I really liked the depiction of the different characters and how they all blended and interact with one another. It's really nice how each character keeps its own uniqueness and how they also blend together, creating some amazing moments. I really appreciated the humor of the movie which was really useful to break the tension in many points during the story.

The Ultron was AMAZING as a villain as well as the Vision. The movie was packed with action and had an amazing flow that made you think you were already 1h30m into the movie, when it was actually only 45 minutes. Scenes that were too much even for such a movie were significantly less than the first movie. I really liked the way some parallel stories evolve and I was really happy to see in the end how the movie leaves room for another one.",10

Great Movie. Why the Hate?,4 May 2015,,10
A Well Stitched Movie Which Lost It's Threads At The End.,25 April 2015,"Let me start off by saying that the sequel was better than the original in terms of acting, the dark vibe and also action but what started to be a great movie didn't on that note. There was no enough build up for the new characters like The Scarlet Witch and The Quicksilver but Vision was done whose character I connected the most with.

Hawkeye had his own spotlight this time but it was little overwhelming and Hulk's was underwhelming. Paul Bettany as The Vision gave the best performance of all the cast though it was a small appearance it was worth watching.

Coming to the story, as I said in the summary, it was a well stitched movie which lost it's thread at the end. At first the story came strong but it becomes very predictable in middle and the third act had a better action sequence compared to the original but at the same time it loses story-wise. The movie keeps on getting darker and jokes being thrown around everywhere which were completely unnecessary and didn't help to keep up the dark vibe of the movie.

Better Special Effects than the original yes, better music no, the music was a complete disappointment and I know i can't expect that from a superhero movie (with the exception of The Dark Knight trilogy) its predecessor had much better music. The director's execution was good he gave some pretty interesting camera angles which added beauty to the movie. If only the story was held together it would have been one hell of a Superhero movie.

Overall it was a fun summer movie with all the action one can ask for and if you are a comic book movie fan then this one movie is for you.",7

Redefining the word Avenging,30 April 2015,"If, and, where The Avengers failed to captivate audiences, The Avengers Age of Ultron succeed, and in may ways excelled. There are numerous ways that this movie could be reviewed. Compared to the first one, or as an individual movie itself. Generally second movies have always fallen prey to the sequel syndrome, where the hopes and expectations of the film are let down; this is not that sequel. The movie itself is so gripping of excitement that one does not need to provide any spoilers to divulge just how breathtaking it will leave you, or more so excited. Each and every scene offers something new. Where the first movie was more about how the Avengers come to be, this movie shows the mentality and development of each character and why they are who they are respectively. The one thing that genuinely makes this film stand apart is the technology. Again, without spoiling, there are so many parts that make this a world that can be, but has yet to happen. Alien technology aside, which is a hard thing when talking about the Avengers, the human tech has been beefed up in a very realistic and futuristic way. Each and every fight scene gets better and better throughout the movie, and the characters themselves make the movie. So many laughs, so many twist, many where the action was less than a second beforehand, and you are still asking how and why, but there is no time to think. That is not an issue though, it all gets explained. The cause for a 9 rating instead of a perfect 10 is that there are some gaps. Questions of how he or she got there so fast, almost making it look like they teleported, but that was not the case. Overall, Avengers Age of Ultron is thus far the best action movie of 2015, and with respects to Marvel, the best franchise movie yet. What the future holds for Marvel has yet to be revealed, but there are clues. When the next movie is released, the battle to save the earth, to save mankind, will need more heroes than the ones that have already captivated the theatrical world.",9
umm...too much...much too much,2 May 2015,"Fans will hate me. Heck, I kind of hate myself...but very disappointed in this film. Oh, even my children will hate me. My seven year old said, ""Just awesome...awesome..."" when asked about this movie. And, to a seven year old, it is awesome. And truthfully, the movie doesn't fail on any particular point...but there is just too much. The movie is about Tony Stark making the world a safer place by making an automated defense system, which gains sentient life, and decides that the world would be better off without mankind or the avengers to muck with it. Boiled down, it is the monster from Frankenstein that turns on it's creator. Not a bad story. The problem I have is that there are 15 characters. Hulk, Banner (so different that they have to be listed separately), Iron Man, Cap, Thor, Black Widow, Hawkeye, Nick Fury, Prof. Jane, Quicksilver, Scarlet Witch, etc. The characters from the other movies that don't show up get mentioned. I heard about Pepper and Loki and etc etc. Look, we've been getting 2 hour movies based on each character. A two hour movie about Captain America, a two hour movie about Iron Man, a two hour movie about Thor....if you think you can shoehorn all these characters, and 5 times as many, into one movie and try to tell a decent story, you're wrong. With all those characters, we are reduced to watching fight scene after fight scene with quick cuts to each character, and in the end, you just felt lost. You can't watch a video about DDAY and watch every soldier...so you pick up with Tom Hanks and follow his crew up the beach. You can't see everything, so you have to focus on one small element in that frame, and you go with that. They had so much to throw at the screen, it was hard to keep it going, and hard to care.

So...I don't care. I found myself more interested in the popcorn. Oh, I think it's going to be a huge success, and I will look forward to seeing it on DVD where I can pause, rewind, and laugh (and lot's of good humor, though a couple of jokes are kind of adult in nature which is odd in a kids movie), and I will enjoy the heck out of the cd. But, honestly, I got lost in the movie, and exhausted trying to keep up with all the characters, and in the end, it just wasn't fun.

It would have been awesome if it had one solo hero going after ultron, and then just getting help from the rest of the avengers....wouldn't it?",6
this movie was simply an insult to superhero movies in general,11 July 2016,,1
Pros & Cons of AoU..Honest Synopsis *No Spoilers*,1 May 2015,"One of the biggest challenge this movie has to overcome is hype! where the only acceptable review for fans is ""This is the Best Superhero Movie ever made""

So after reading so many threads trying to convince everyone this is the worst Marvel movie ever made i was little bit skeptical walking into the theater but i ended up walking out pretty Happy.

Not to say the movie doesn't have any problems but then again no movie is without!

this is my NO SPOILER list of Pros & Cons of the movie.

CONS:

Exposition, strangely enough most Sci-Fi movies have a little too much exposition but AoU really needed some exposition in many scenes.

Without spoiling Ultron & Vision needed a little more explaining although i get the feeling this may be by design.

Humour I really love Whedon's humour this movie genuinely had me laughing at most jokes, but a couple of times i felt like they could have been tones down.

Nick Fury Deus ex machina again after seeing the latest AoS feel like this might be explained as well.

Pacing: Some argued the pacing of the first movie felt slow in the middle this one is way too fast throughout, they could have slowed down a couple time & extend the runtime by a few more minutes.

Super Nerdy not really a con, i personally love that but i can see how average moviegoers might not get it and this being the 12th movie it relies on you to know some of the backstory.

PROS:

Avengers! everything that worked in the first movie team dynamic, one lines & character moments are awesome and still feel fresh

Ultron, Yes he is a good villain!!!! he could have been fleshed out a little more but he has the cunningness of Loki & Raw physical power of Winter Soldier.

Vision, the less said about Vision the better but i get the feeling he will go on to be one of the more memorable Avenger.

MCU: Happy to see this is not an isolated incident on earth like Iron Man 3 this has deep & far reaching ties into the MCU

ACTION: watch in 2D this movie has some of the best action choreography in a superhero movie,most notably Opening,Hulkbuster & climax

So these are the short list of PROS & CONS off the top of my head i really enjoyed the movie, its a lot better the second time another stellar addition to MCU.",
A very well done and interesting movie.,30 December 2015,"Avengers:Age of Ultron is one of the final movies in marvel phase 2 and while not as great as the first one,this movie is still very good. The action in this movie is truly spectacular and the visual effects are really good and believable throughout.This movie is filled with fighting sequences from the very beginning until the end.And I love all of them especially the end battle where the stakes are really high and a few emotional moments. Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch are some of the new additions and they are very awesome and well done.I honestly thought that Quicksilver is not going to be good after what I saw on X-Men DOFP but he is great here too,and so is the actor who portrays him. I love the group talks,seeing them get mad at each other and hating/loving is just so much fun and interesting.Also this movie is filled with laughs and comedic moments everywhere,which I truly appreciate. As about the main villain,Ultron,in my opinion,he was very well done.I really liked him,and his sarcastic jokes.which I found funny every single time.He is mesmerizing and not forgettable at all.His intentions very understandable and the only problem with him was his creation,which felt rushed but besides that he is a very good villain. There are some things that don't quiet work here,and other things that they did which just feel like they are setting up for the next movies to come in the marvel universe,but these are small flaws and passable ones because this movie overall is very well done and interesting until the very end.",7
A spectacle to watch!!,26 April 2015,,10
Not as much Fun as the First One.,1 May 2015,"Spectacular action scenes and sophisticated, interesting super heroes cannot quite make up for the fact that the story entangles itself in too many plot lines so that ""Age of Ultron"" is a less exciting adventure than its prequel has been.

The balancing act between seriousness and humor doesn't seem to work as smoothly as before and the big love story quickly develops some soap-opera like feeling to it which makes it an additional side line that rather distracts from the main plot than giving more depth to it.

More of a disappointment is unfortunately the main villain too. ""Ultron"" is supposed to be one of the most dangerous and merciless enemies in the Marvel universe and instead he is too charming too be really frightening, he is still cool but his potential has been wasted.

A positive surprise is ""Hawkeye"" whose story gets more attention and meaning this time and I really like it that the big final battle takes place in a South-European country for a change.

""Age of Ultron"" has all the necessary ingredients for a fantastic blockbuster, however, the fine-tuning is flawed and considering the high expectations it leaves an aftertaste of mediocrity.",7
Full pack of Action!!,7 October 2015,"This is a movie I've been waiting months to see. I'm a big Marvel Comics and movie fan. This is one well crafted, superhero and super fun..

As for the characters and cast , All the returning cast are as good as they have been in previous installments.Aaron Taylor-Johnson as Pietro Maximoff/Quicksilver his acting is as expected personally I find him to be a good actor.Then we have Elizabeth Olsen as Wanda Maximoff/Scarlett Witch, another extremely talented actress in my opinion, she was brilliant in this too..

The runtime does seem long however, there is enough going on at every turn that you kind of forget how long you have been watching and that is a good thing.

All in all its a best Marvels movie, and if you're a fan of Marvel, Superheros or action films in general, you have to see this. :)",8
"Very good, not fantastic, but very good.",14 May 2015,"Alright, this held my attention through the whole film. I liked the quiet parts more than the noisy ones, actually.

The cast is great, Wedon gives them quipy dialogue throughout. The revelations of the characters (things we didn't know about some of them prior to this installment) were I thought its biggest strength.

Won't reveal any of them here, but suffice to say, sometimes it's nice to see under the armor, if you take my meaning.

I liked it, but what kept me from loving it? Probably the fact that they're essentially going after another big baddie and his countless minions, who are easily dispatched, as they were in the first Avengers. I had hoped the threat would spin what we've seen on its back, but alas.",7
Age of Ultron: AWESOME,23 April 2015,"So..Let me start off by saying that,being a huge fan of Avengers and its first movie, I was nervous. Nervous because I wasn't sure about the Twins, whether I would like them or not, and because the first movie was so great that it was hard to picture a better one. Well..I was wrong!!so wrong. This movie is one of those you need to see more than once. The characters are,as usual,amazing, but they've evolved since Avengers and are much,much better. In Avengers it felt that some members of the team were more important than others, in this movie they're all equally awesome in their own ways. The action..THE ACTION, from beginning to end is non-stop, the movie begins and ends with action scenes,one better than the previous one. And lastly, the comic reliefs, I remember laughing plenty in Avengers but in this movie it's one joke after the other and they're all awesome! There were some people who complained about all the sneak peaks,saying that it showed too much, let me tell you,you will encounter a lot of things in the movie that you probably weren't expecting, in a good way. One piece of advice: What Whedon said is true, there is no after- credit scene(I stayed till the end just to be sure)but there is one AMAZING mid- credit scene. So,grab your popcorn and enjoy what will most likely be the best movie of the year!I plan to rewatch it many times.",10
"Not as good as the first film, still a solid sequel",6 June 2016,"No matter how much 'Avengers'/Marvel detractors go out of their way to suggest that those who legitimately like the 'Avengers' films and Marvel's output are wrong and invent ridiculous conspiracy theories without proof, this reviewer loved 'Avengers Assemble' while acknowledging that it wasn't perfect.

'Avengers: Age of Ultron' is a solid sequel, though not as good as 'Assemble' and not without its flaws. There are a few longueurs in the pacing, as a result of a few overlong scenes that don't go very far (as admirable as it was to do more with Hawkeye's character, the farm scene did grind the film to a halt somewhat), parts that were not as developed as one would have liked or didn't add much to the film and some of the many characters are more interesting than others.

While one does admire that more was attempted to be done with Hawkeye, he still felt underwritten and not always necessary. Ultron, despite a cool appearance and chilling voice work from James Spader, is an underdeveloped, not very interesting and one-dimensional villain and doesn't pose enough of a threat. And while most of the comedy is funny and witty, there are moments that jar too much when the scene is serious or intense and it spoils the mood.

However, 'Avengers: Age of Ultron' looks fantastic, very slickly shot and edited with sumptuous and atmospheric set and costume design and quite spectacular special effects. The music avoids being overbearing or over-bombastic, as well as avoiding being too quirky or one-note. Joss Whedon ensures that the fun and tension rarely slips and that a good deal of the characterisation is interesting, visually and stylistically there is nothing to fault here.

Furthermore, the film is wittily, cleverly and intelligently scripted with a good deal of the tonal shifts handled well with only some jarring humour disappointing. While not perfect in execution, the story is absorbing, there are plenty of fun moments, thrillingly choreographed and executed action scenes (especially the earth-shattering climax) and while it could have been developed a little more and could have been less forced when introduced Hulk and Black Widow's relationship is given admirably sensitive treatment here.

The film's characters are mostly interesting and engaging, not complex but that wasn't expected. The acting is impeccable, Robert Downey Jnr, Chris Hemsworth and Chris Evans really excel in roles tailor made for them, while Scarlett Johansson gives a fearless intensity to Black Widow and Mark Ruffalo is by far the best and most layered live-action Hulk. As said, James Spader is chilling as the voice of Ultron, and one does wish that more was done with the character, Paul Bettany and Samuel L. Jackson are great value and Aaron Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen play the newcomer roles with plenty of fire. Jeremy Renner does what he can.

Overall, a solid sequel if not as good as 'Avengers Assemble'. 7/10 Bethany Cox",7
"A fun, comedic and action packed film that lived up to all expectations",22 April 2015,"Avengers Age of Ultron was one of the biggest and most anticipated movies of the year and it did not disappoint. This movie was everything you want an avengers movie to be, a near perfect blend between Action, Comedy, and character development. I felt that they handled the large cast fairly well with each of the avengers getting a good amount of screen time. But it isn't just the individual characters that makes it so entertaining, it is the chemistry between the characters that works so well. All of the subplots and jokes that they carry throughout the film stay interesting and really elevate the film. The comedy is exactly what you expect from an avengers film, the back and forth jokes work to really lighten the mood and give it that Marvel film feel, even Ultron sneaks a few jokes in a couple of times.Now let's talk about the action, this film had plenty of action sequences from start to finish and they are just so fun and exciting and you are on the edge of your seat at all times. The way the film finds ways to capture all these characters fighting at the same time in a way so that you can see everything that happens is amazing.

Ultron was definitely an awesome villain and maybe the strongest and best villain the Marvel universe has seen so far. He is so evil that when he is on screen you feel his presence and how intimidating he is. He really adds a lot to the plot and makes the film so much more entertaining in both the action scenes and plot driven scenes. Speaking of the plot, the subplots I thought all worked really well and the main plot for the most part was really interesting. I just thought that the first half of the film felt a little messy as it tried to setup Ultron and some other characters while trying to still include the characters we have known so far. The jumping between locations and all that could have been refined a little better, but they did what they had to do within the runtime. But that is the only issue I had with the film and a minor one at that. Everything else gelled together so well and created one of the best (and my favourite) movies of the year so far. If you love Marvel films and action films in general I believe you will love this fun, action packed film. - 9.5",9
8.5/10,22 April 2015,"So many things to get out there, but before starting let me just give a disclaimer. I do not remember a time in my life where I wasn't reading Marvel Comics, that is totally true. I am a Marvel Comics geek and The Avengers have been, alongside the Cosmic comics, my favorite series to read and have brought some of the best stories I have ever had the pleasure to enjoy. So when judging a Marvel film there are always two sides of me that are adding up to the final judgment: one side is the film nerd that just wants to get a great movie, the other is the comic nerd that wants his favorite characters to have the best portrayal on screen. That whole introduction might have gone on for two pages, but it was to say I might go into some nerdy territory that general film goers don't care about, but I just can't help it.

As you guessed from my score I liked the movie and upon second viewing I will go as far as actually loving it. One thing that I want to get out first is that for the first time, since 2008's ""Iron Man"", I finally saw the MCU coming into it's own. Every movie before was always trying to find it's place in with the other movies, but finally I saw the MCU as I had dreamed of it. It was just like in the comics and I truly loved that, it takes all the mythology and gives it for granted and throws you right into it. There is no need to set-up things, it nailed the feeling of a comic book even more than the first one.

""Age of Ultron"" excels on so many levels it is very difficult to start with one because you are immediately thrown into talking about another. I'll start with what I thought was the best part: the characters. Joss Wheodn proves again he understands these characters more than anybody else and makes the very best out of them. There are many, many character moments that are gold and the best are the intimate ones. My favorite parts really were watching the characters interact and argue, the writing value of some scenes was really remarkable. Moreover it is great to see them having grown and knowing each other, it offered a new dynamic that made things all the more enjoyable and again so close to the comic books. Obviously the action sequences are absolutely stunning. My favorite being the very opening one: the film opens with a long shot that had my mouth dropped to the floor and fortunately these breathtaking shots continue throughout the film. Scene after scene I was glued to my seat because of the relentlessness of the visually fantastic action that was always in service of story. It was so brilliantly put together: the vision of the director is so clearly brought to the screen; the complexity of the scenes is so deep, I truly admire the talent of the filmmakers in bringing them to life. The comedy moments obviously work and are juxtaposed to some even better dramatic moments. Plus, as a comic nerd, I lost count of moments where I just geeked out in joy. Overall, this was simply a fabulous ride that never left me time to catch my breath and actually improved on second viewing.

All of the negatives are minor things, there isn't one gaping flaw, but when added up they simply don't match the flawlessness of the first one, which is one of my favourite movies of all time. Firstly, Ultron was underwhelming. It pains my fingers to type it, but it is true. Ultron is one of the best villains in history probably, forget Skynet, Ultron is the incarnation of AI gone wrong and is one of the most compelling villains to read about especially the relation with his creator (which by the way I am really bummed isn't Hank Pym because of what it means to that character), but these aspects were never explored and his motivations were really underdeveloped. He wasn't simply given the portrayal he deserves. He was a kind of cool villain, but he wasn't Ultron to me. The storytelling overall wasn't as flawless as in its predecessor, it was very good, but it left bits and pieces behind. The CGI some very rare times popped out. The action was sometimes sloppy and too fast cutting, for the majority it really stands tall, but there were moments here and there were it wasn't as good as it could have been. Moreover, the film just doesn't take risks, there are no major surprises and so it simply doesn't up the stake as much as I wanted to. Now this is really bragging but here are two pet peeves of mine: firstly, I just missed the Seamus McGarvey cinematography, Ben Davis was great don't get me wrong just look above to find my praises of the visuals in this film, but I just missed the what McGarvey is able to do, that being making every single frame immaculate, with Davis there was that shot once in a while that just fell flat. The second pet peeve is something that really bothered me, they tease and tease the Avengers theme throughout, but it never plays! And even worst it plays during the credits! That was really something that missed for me, it gave a great push at the very end, but it was simply too late.

Enough nitpicking, I really, really recommend this film to anybody, nerd or not, I genuinely had a riveting experience for the whole duration and that isn't something that many movies do to me. Yes there are many negatives that can be pointed out, but there is just so much to be enjoyed and loved that as much as you can think back to the negatives the better parts will stick out much more.",7
Mindless drivel,15 May 2015,"Well, the superhero movies have sucked their last dollar out of me. I don't like watching movies just to see things blown up. The writers and director are so much into showing off their destructive action sequences that they didn't pause to consider whether soneone would actually give an F. Superthin plot. The occasional quip grom Ultron or an Avenger gets old quick with nothing else to support it. We're clearly dealing with high school humor here. I really like the scene where the earth is caving in, thousands of people obviously meeting gruesome deaths, and yet a few Avengers take the time to save one woman in a falling vehicle...NOT.",1
Close to being mediocre,11 May 2015,"Marvel needs to be careful... what with many more sequels and spin- offs lined up, Marvel runs the risk of becoming repetitive and dry (which they mask with CGI stunts and gimmicky action scenes). The first half of Age of Ultron felt like a sequel that was trying too hard. Action scenes were atypical and predictable. The one-liners and scenes where the Avengers are trying to have fun felt so forced. What confused me a lot too was the apparent love story between the Hulk and the Black Widow. When did that happen??

But by the second half of the movie Age of Ultron redeems itself. The plot develops, we see a lot of discord and conflict among the Avengers themselves and some heart-wrenching scenes amidst an epic floating city action scene.

I have hope yet for Marvel, but they are walking a thin line between amazing sequels and repetitive, recycled material glitzed with an over-spray of ""razzle dazzle"" that tries to hide the danger that they might one day run out of ideas.",7
excellent!,21 August 2015,"This movie did not disappoint! Extremely well done! You are totally been sent to different place where That's what a movie should be all about! I seriously cant wait to see more of avengers.. I never really like avengers before but MAN I become a fan now! Shrieks

The plot is well made, Everything about the story line and the association of each characters and the actions itself is totally breathtaking.

One of the most, exciting movie i have ever seen thus far. And I am so hoping to see more!

Furthermore, I don't even get why these people does not appreciate a good story telling and visual impact of the movie! This movie rocks! I cant wait to see scarlet witch improve! And the other, avenger characters!

"Great , Fun Movie",9 May 2015,,10
"Brainlessly enjoyable, action filled stupidity.",17 April 2021,"It's a fun movie. The story that is featured is pretty decent, it lacks depth in some areas and has some major pacing issues, but for an avengers movie it is solid. There are a lot of unnecessary scenes that could either be replaced or completely removed from the film to better develop the plot and the characters. Some of the characters are pressed more heavily than others as well, Tony is really the main character in the film, he creates the villain and shows his true side while changing his persona very slowly, but it doesn't feel that way, it just feels like he shows up and is stupid for the sake of the storyline. This means that there isn't really a MAIN character. Captain America does literally nothing besides fighting robots, hulk smashes, black widow does some flips and the other sides characters do nothing. The only person I feel had an improvement was hawkeye, his life outside the avengers is explored more thoroughly and it pays off, it is actually one of the more interesting sub-plots of the story. The plot is quite linear, straight-forward and simple which is nice, it means you can shut your brain off and just watch as superheroes crush the robots. The villain is actually pretty good... to begin. He is very intimidating as a battered old stark robot but soon turns into a pretty bland supervillain with lowsy dialogue and really unnecessary humour. Besides all the negativity the movie is enjoyable to watch, its over the top as all marvel movies and is very exciting to watch. The effects, shots and soundtrack are all excellent as usual and help to bring the movie to what it is. I give it a 7, its gud.",7
Wonderful Marvel Addition,2 May 2015,,9
Good but missing something 7.5,22 November 2021,"I loved the first one, 10/10. This one was just missing something. It had all the ingredients. I think it was the main villain. I'm not a fan of James Spader's smug voice so maybe that's why I didn't enjoy it. There was way too much CGI. It was very well done, just too much of it. Also I didn't get a lot of reason why Ultron did what he wanted to do. He just did it with little explanation.

Also where were the laughs? There are usually some well placed lines in these films but I didn't see many.

Solid sequel though.",7

one of the most exciting films from the The film is laced with high octane action,a bit comedy and some very intuitive drama. this is marvel best due to the fact that all the actors play up to there parts and no just one of them steals the show it is brilliant also amazing also Ultron As Villain is Very Reminiscent of Darth Vader he is Ruthless albeit he has a sickening sense of Humor also With The Introduction of the Twins Scarlet Witch Hit everyone right were they lived even more so than Loki did in The First Avengers which brought out complexity and the vulnerability in each character similar to what Vader did in The Empire Strikes Back also the film felt looser than the first it was better.

Amazing Direction & Screenplay from Joss Whedon(The Avengers) costume design from Alexandra Byrne(Guardians Of The Galaxy),Amazing Score from Both Brian Tyler(Battle Los Angeles) & Danny Elfman(Silver Linings Playbook) not as good as its Origin Movie.Avengers Age Of Ultron is One The Best MCU Film to Date.

One Big Joke,4 May 2015,,1
Not surprised with what we got...,22 April 2015,"This was an alright movie with some very awesome moments peppered throughout and an abundance of humor all round.

The trailers make the movie seem much darker than the first, however Ultron is just a smart ass and their humor is of par with guardians of the galaxy, possibly surpassing it.

This movie just feels like a build up to the next movie instead of a continuation of the previous episodes.

Hopefully Ant-Man will be better

Overall it was not a bad movie by any means, but i will never see it again 7/10",7

Never ending actionand comedy,27 September 2015,,10
That spirit of fun,29 June 2015,"If there were not an audience for Marvel comic heroes than clearly these films would not be made, to answer one other reviewer although I sympathize with him somewhat. The world is indeed an infinitely more complex place than the world of Marvel comics with clearly identifiable heroes and villains. But I get the feeling that from Robert Downey, Jr. on down the organizer and prime mover as Iron Man behind the Avengers these players do love doing these roles because it's a lot of fun. If they didn't show that spirit of fun to the audience than these films would never be made.

So in that spirit of fun Avengers: Age Of Ultron comes before us and everyone looks like they're having a good time saving the world. A computer program got loose and took form in this dimension named Ultron and James Spader who is completely unrecognizable is running amuck in the earth. No doubt Star Trek fans took notice that this guy's mission is to cleanse the earth much like that old earth probe NOMAD which got its programming mixed up in that classic Star Trek prime story. Wouldst Captain James T. Kirk of the Enterprise had a crew like Downey has at his command.

My favorite is always Chris Evans because of the whole cast he best gets into the spirit of being a superhero. Of all of them, he's already played two superheroes, Captain America and Johnny Storm the Human Torch. I'll be before he's done Evans will play a couple of more as long as the money's good and he enjoys it.

Pretend you're a kid again and enjoy, don't take it so seriously.",6
Superb Heroes,24 April 2015,"Jumping right in to the action, this is one heck of a thrill ride only slowing the pace for a few moments to give a little back story to several characters that have not had their own film, and the new characters. I enjoyed the fight scenes immensely, with one in particular that had me grinning like the Cheshire cat.

Fans of the Marvel movies will already know what to expect from Thor, Iron man and Captain America, and the real delight for me came from the new arrivals, especially Paul Bettany as Vision.

The Real highlight for me was the villain Ultron. The way he looks and moves combined with the amazing voice from James Spader gives Ultron real screen presence and a great sense of menace that sets it apart from other robots in film.

The only thing I would have changed in this movie was to give Anthony Mackie a bigger part in it because i really enjoyed his performance in Captain America: the Wintrr Soldier, and was disappointed not to have him alongside Chris Evans again where he seemed to fit perfectly in his previous appearance. Vastly enjoyable film for all except the art crowd.",10
Uniquely Entertaining - Marvel at its Best,3 May 2015,"Avengers: Age of Ultron made its domestic debut this week and, without getting into any spoiler territory, I'll give you my first impressions. In short, darker and more serious than the first Avengers but it's still packed with plenty of humor, action and character development. I would call it uniquely entertaining because it is a different kind of film than its predecessor, but is no less entertaining. Synopsis

In Age of Ultron, Tony Stark's effort to 'put a suit of armor around the world' by combining artificial intelligence with his armor technology goes awry. Enter Ultron, a robot with more personality than you'd expect from a robot and a chaotic plan to bring 'peace' to the globe. The film is rated PG-13 for intense sequences of sci-fi action, violence and destruction, and for some suggestive comments. Firing on All Cylinders

This film finds the Avengers finally hitting their stride together, rather than hitting each other, and doesn't have to spend any time 'assembling' the team, as was necessary in the first film. The obvious benefit is this leaves more time for actual Avenging, character development and introduction of new characters. While the first 25-35% of the film was less engaging for me, since the characters' chemistry and jokes were coming off a bit flat, the film started hitting its stride about a third of the way through and then was firing on all cylinders from that point on.

Probably my favorite part of this film was how the characters were handled. There was significant effort put into developing each main characters' personality, motivations and fears such that I felt more invested in both the characters and the outcome of the film. The end of the world sure means a whole lot more when you care about the people in it.

I can honestly say that I think I laughed out loud at this film more than almost any other film that I've ever seen. Joss Whedon, the film's director, did a great job incorporating the actors' natural chemistry together into the characters' relationships. While the Avengers definitely still have their differences, their witty dialogue, quirky mannerisms and humorous facial expressions are incredibly entertaining and serve as welcome breaks during tense situations. This all-star cast seems like a fun group of people to hang out with, in or out of character. What Didn't Quite Work

Since this film was obviously created for 3D viewing and it has extensive CGI (including the main villain, who is entirely computer generated), some of the preliminary action sequences and scenes with Ultron took me out of the film a bit. By this I mean that they probably would have looked awesome in 3D, but because I was seeing the film in 2D, the occasional slow-motion action with something flying toward the screen just felt kind of weird.

It also seemed like there were several moments toward the beginning of the film where I could tell they were acting against a green-screen, as if they hadn't completely finished touching up the composite work. These are only minor complaints though, as you can tell, and the average moviegoer will probably not pick up on them.

Rating: 8/10

While my ratings are subject to change within a star or two pending subsequent viewings, I am giving Age of Ultron an 8 out of 10. Please don't confuse 8/10 with 80% (B-); 8/10 means that, overall, I REALLY LIKED IT!! To put it in context, here are some of my other ratings in recent years: The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers: 10/10 (the only film to ever achieve that recognition) The Avengers: 9/10 Inception: 9/10 Captain America: The Winter Soldier: 8/10 Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl: 8/10 Princess Mononoke: 8/10 Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol: 8/10 I'm not one of those who gives a 10/10 just because I liked something. Really, anything a 5 or higher means that I liked it more than I disliked it, so getting to the 7, 8, or 9 territory means that we are talking about a quality, entertaining film - at least in my book. So go check it out - I know that I'm going back to see it in IMAX next week!! Can't wait! Thanks for reading!",7
"Best Action-packed MARVEL movie,Bigger,More Exciting...A WORTHY sequel indeed!!!!",30 April 2015,,9
Weakest Marvel film of the series,2 May 2015,"There was bound to be a time when the masters at Marvel would make a misstep and Avengers: Age of Ultron is that disappointing moment.

We at Archon Reviews like to keep our reviews as ""clean"" as possible. Avengers: Age of Ultron leads us to be forced to utilize a term that breaks that rule. Joss Whedon's Age of Ultron is a clusterf#$k of massive proportions.

It was inevitable, and Age of Ultron is proof that even the minds at Marvel Entertainment are not perfect. And Joss Whedon most of all, bites off significantly more than he can handle.

As a story, Age of Ultron feels light years ahead of where the previous Marvel films left off, like a horror movie on its eighth installment. Age of Ultron's plot is convoluted and the entire film lacks the structure of a story with intent that propels itself into being made into a film.

We propel forward to a time when Tony Stark has jump started a peacekeeping programming using androids and state of the art computer programming. Then we jump forward again as the group known as the Avengers realize an entity in the form of Stark's unintentionally created Artificial Intelligence seeks to malevolently target Earth. Of course, our superheros will fight with everything they have to save the world.

Everything about Age of Ultron is forced. From the unnecessarily complicated, multi-layered story, the side characters and the newly manufactured characters that nonchalantly get introduced. Age of Ultron feels dull and lifeless, a blockbuster to cash in on the Marvel name. This fate is completely unlike the caliber of material we Marvel fans are accustomed to and typically resigned to Michael Bay concoctions. Marvel: you are better than this.

Age of Ultron is tired and even the actors appear to have difficulty uttering the dialogue. Those familiar faces from the previous films still do an adequate job but newcomers like Elizabeth Olsen and Aaron Taylor-Johnson are laughably inferior. Both the acting, diction and casting director should be fired from the next Avengers film, if there even is one. There are comedic moments in the film, but unlike the initial Avengers film, feel gimmicky and are painfully overused.

I understand that at this point in the Marvel franchise, the filmmakers had a huge task in front of them. Unfortunately, they fail and the film produced for Marvel lovers is a disappointment. And this is not coming from the vapid whining of a superfan.

No magic. No chemistry. plain robots.,26 April 2015,"I have no idea why I'm the only one among my group of friends who felt this movie doesn't deserve a thumb-up. I yawned all the way till the end, fell asleep for a couple of minutes.

The story is seems to be forcedly connected. I know they are all relevant but the bind of the connection is not that strong. it's like a boring bed time story. Simply jumping from one to another without bothering to develop, even just scratching the surface, personality or in depth of the characters.

The chemistry buildup was not cultivated. Lack of chemistry or connection between the actors. Witty little chitchat doesn't do enough favor to cover the obvious detached actors to their character.

Trying very hard to be impressive; the battling, the kicking, the punching, the heroes and the lines.

All and all,a lazy, superficial gimmicks.",3

"In Whedon, without the Studio Controlling Him, We Trust",2 May 2015,"Watching AVENGERS: AGE OF ULTRON can be summed up with the following words: entertaining, exhausting, and overstuffed. It's also one of the few summer action blockbusters that feels like it could have been better without all those incomprehensible, *forced* action scenes, in which the quiet character scenes between them are so much more memorable and interesting. With the numerous characters, even more so than the first, it's a miracle, then, that director Joss Whedon somehow manages to make the sequel coherent, balanced, and well paced. In the hands of a lesser director, the film could have been a disaster in more ways than one. Still, you can't help but feel Whedon going off a check list to satisfy fans of these superheroes, preventing the film to reach its potential (see: the cliffhanger ending setting up the inevitable sequel). Whedon takes some risks with this one, but overall, he plays it safe.",6

"So messy, so stupid and so hollow",19 May 2015,"When the messy ""Transformer"" franchise spin out of control with uncontrollable, over-the-top computerized CGI crap, I thought that this kinda comic books adapted crap would be bad enough to alert the viewers not to watch such similar genre crap again and again, they would have thought ""enough is enough"" and would not be lured and fooled into the theaters to see another similar crap with different titles. but take a look at this film's budget and its gross collected in America only. It only proved that our viewers' I.Q.s have become even lower than when the ""Transformer"" series were released.

What we got here is an ambitious and greedy endeavor trying to include all the comic books heroes to create a video game like hollow movie, by endless crappy fight after fight, situation after situation nothingness again and again. The computer generated special effects have ruined the creativity of decent screenplay writing, the absolutely necessity of decent acting of actors. Acting and directing only replaced by stunts, acting turned into nothing but hanging cables, shifting all over the places and directions just in front of a green screen. Dialog all turned into robotic language. Endless action and fighting scenes replaced all the logic storyline, scenarios and plots. Special effects dominated everything on the screen, forcing viewers to look at the screen with nothing but computer generated dizzy, fuzzy, messy destruction, explosions, flash...., movies have changed into video game like hollow and superfluous patchworks. All these craps have just paved the way for immediate future releases of similar titled video games. kids and those who refused to grow up timely and appropriately only know to use their fingers and reflexes to replace logic thinking and reasoning. They don't want anything realistic in life but fantasies, they don't want peacefulness but endless and senseless target killings to add their playing scores. Did you ever really use one bit of your brain to realize that computer games fool you to kill bad guys, aliens, vampires and zombies, claiming that you are doing good to mankind, maintaining and keep the civilization from destruction....such and such are nothing but commercial gimmicks. Microsoft, Sony, Disney and all those cunning Hollywood grease balls are only trying to grab all the hard earned money by you or your parents to enrich their bank accounts? Why don't you just take one minute or just one moment to compare all these movies and video games with each other, seeing the repeated similarity of them. Why you never got tired of these craps? This particular film is trying to fool and mess up your I.Q., your logic and your normal process of maturity. Hollywood knows that only keep you at the level of elementary school level and manipulates you by keep watching these kinda films would forever fixed you as morons, because only morons would pay willingly to glorify the gross of the box office records.",
"Great popcorn blockbuster production, but it stops there",10 May 2015,"As usual, Marvel has nailed it. Age of Ultron is a great popcorn blockbuster production.

I won't go into the same reviews everybody already wrote: yes, same characters going crazier. Same witty dialogue up a notch. James Spader is a fantastic villain and a great choice for Ultron. The new comers are quite good, Quicksilver, Scarlet Witch, Vision, were good enough.

All that having being said. This was supposed to be the ending for the MCU's Phase 2. At that phase, Tony Stark should have retired from the Iron Man mantle (as of the horrible Iron Man 3 showed). Thor should've been retired and living with Jane Foster (as of the reasonable Thor 2 Dark World).

Captain America 2 retired SHIELD, but if you've been following the Agents of SHIELD TV Series you already know they've been rebuilding it. The intersection with the TV show and the movie was quite abrupt in my opinion and felt rushed.

At least the TV is showing developments towards the Inhumans for Phase 3. Captain America 3 Civil War will be Avengers 2.5. The lack of any mention to the upcoming Scott Lang's Antman was a huge missing opportunity.

The major problem with Age of Ultron is that it picked up where Avengers, Winter Soldier and Agents of SHIELD left off and ignored Iron Man 3, Thor 2. The MCU was supposed to be one concise and coherent universe. But the more they deliver new movies, the bigger the gaps.

Winter Soldier and Guardians of the Galaxy were by far the best thing about Phase 2 thus far and Age of Ultron was unable to top it. And this is what makes this super highly anticipated movie fall short.

Production value was really high and I enjoyed watching it in the theater and I will enjoy watching it again on Blu Ray. But it did not make any real impact to kick off Phase 3. It seems more like Civil War will be more meaningful to the MCU.

The MCU mythos is getting convoluted too fast. Too many gaps are not being addressed. It's already very difficult to explain the story to newcomers. Each big Phase should have some closure as an arc, but it's not helping. With sideshows such as Daredevil and Agent Carter, it only adds to the bloat. Unless Civil War can do something about it, the MCU will lose a lot of steam in Phase 3 and Infinity Wars will be too little too late in the future.

Age of Ultron felt just like a throw away story. Don't get me wrong: it's a very nice blockbuster for sure, but it's not what it was supposed to be.",7
Another great chapter in the MCU!,2 May 2015,,10
"Somewhat over-whelming, but still a pretty spectacular ride",12 May 2015,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning

Opening in the action, the Avengers have been sent to rescue some people from a mad doctor in the Alps, who wants to experiment on them. Among them are a brother and sister pair, who possess special powers of their own, but who hold a grudge against Tony Stark, as they remember seeing a weapon made by his company lying in the rubble, after their parents were killed in the war torn country they are from. But after the mission's success, Stark becomes the spanner in the works again, when he talks fellow scientist Bruce Banner in to meddling with nature and opening the peacekeeping program Ultron to secure harmony in the world. Big mistake, as Ultron forms a life of it's own, and decides to try and wipe out the human race and replace it with his own kind.

Having unthinkably missed the original Avengers spectacle on the big screen three years ago, no way was I going to miss Joss Whedon's inevitable sequel, which promised to be bigger, badder and balsier than the last one, as they always do. This may be the case, but it hardly makes it better, as such. And, as grand and outside the box as it may be, that is the case. The follow up, like it's main antagonist Stark, is a victim of it's own blind ambition, a relentless, none stop roller coaster ride that bombards you with flash all the way to the end, and just leaves you over-whelmed. With Stark being the main character, and Robert Downey Jr. being the biggest star, it falls to reason that most of the attention falls on them, with even the publicity before the film's release (notably Jr's unfortunate walk-out interview with Tristram Guru Murphy or whatever his name is) maybe tying in with the hype.

At nearly three hours, the film is just too over-loaded and over ambitious, getting carried away with itself and just leaving the viewer feeling deflated by the end as a result. It would be one thing if there were some exciting bits throughout, but there's too many long stretches where nothing exciting happens that make it even more too much. Going on this long, it stands to reason that too much must be going on with the plot, which just gets a little over-complicated and at times none coherent.

Like the predecessor, however, it wisely keeps it's tongue in it's cheek, and the gang (especially, as ever, Stark) are always at their wise cracking best, it's still a dazzlingly colourful spectacle with, at times, jaw dropping action and visual effects and, again, it works better with them all as one than as separate entities on their own. The original, however, wisely kept it all at an endurable running time, so you could appreciate these qualities more, while this follow up goes overboard and, for all it's strengths, is just a little too much as a result. ***",7
Never As Profound As It Thinks It Is,28 April 2015,"I really should keep up on Superhero movies . But there's a reason I don't - I simply don't like them . They personify everything I dislike about modern Hollywood blockbusters , lots of explosions , lots of stunts and lots of CGI . It's less like watching a film and more like logging on to youtube and watching gameplay of the latest state of the art computer game

AVENGERS AGE OF ULTRON gets off to the exact start I'm talking about . Most of the iconic Marvel Superheroes - and the audience are thrust in to an opening action sequence . It's very vague what this mission is , something about East European baddies in league with Hydra working on some artificial intelligence . Ignore the narrative because the opening involves lots of stunts , ramping and explosions with the occasional one liner thrown in . You want action you've got it . You want intelligent , stimulating storytelling ? Go and read a book . I can understand what the producers are pandering to but I found this pre-title sequence rather uninvolving and the rest of the film continues in the same way

One thing the film does try and do is merge high concept action with character driven moments . On paper it does have a relatively good cast and it'd be a pity to waste it on overblown action but it's not really an actors type of film and while the production team deserves some credit for trying to concentrate on character but it's not developed enough to be entirely successful and comes across as rather shallow

Despite this short review I'm big enough to stick up my hand and say this movie isn't produced for grumpy , middle aged men like myself , it's produced for younger people who can't get enough superhero movies and for this market the prospective audience will probably love it so much so that that'll be a contender for biggest grossing film of 2015 and we'll be getting more Marvel movies for the foreseeable future",5
"""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" is a Meh and an unremarkable movie.",30 April 2015,"""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" is a meh and an unremarkable movie. Just when I thought Marvel was starting to Mature with ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" & ""The Winter Soldier"" ,they go right back to making a generic soulless superhero movie you have seen a 100 times before. I am still waiting for them to pull a ""The Dark Knight"" and make a movie that is unpredictable and completely flips the script. They crammed & rushed so much in this movie. Ultron is Evil right away. They don't even touch on why Tony is back as Iron Man despite retiring in ""Iron Man 3"", making the end of that movie redundant. They try to give Hawkeye some depth which just feels like 4 movies too late. There's a forced romance between Black Widow & the Hulk which comes out of nowhere. Despite Black Widow being a female Christian Grey all this time with her mysterious and secretive personality. Now all of sudden she's jonesing and wanting to take a shower with The Hulk. Also Jesus Christ there's so much repetitive Power Rangers/ Transformers level action. Say what you will about ""Fast & Furious 7"". But at least all the action scenes were memorable, intense and entertaining. The action scenes aren't engaging because there's no tension. We all know no one is going to Die because there's so many bloody sequels coming out over the next 5 years. The action scenes quickly become White Noise. Hell even ""Cinderella"" a Disney family movie was more visually stunning and engaging. The only pro's is the Banter between The Avengers, some funny one liner's, Scarjo's cute nose and Elizabeth Olsen finally getting some recognition. The movie just feels like it was made in a factory. No heart just a business transaction. Skip this ""Cultural genocide"" and wait for the Blu Ray. ""Fast and Furious 7"" and ""Cinderella"" put this movie to shame. 6/10",6
Not worth near all the hate. LOVED IT,4 May 2015,,10
Proves Marvel's Streak Will Not End for a Long Time.,22 April 2015,"Avengers Age of Ultron is nothing short of a cinematic masterpiece. It has set a new bar for superhero movies to come and gives us a glimpse into Marvel's ever-growing future. Whedon knows his audience and he delivers every time. Action scenes are masterful and every frame a painting. Every actor knows their role in and out, including Spader who's performance is incredible. And not forgetting how well the jokes blend in. They are executed perfectly and really break up the tone every now and again. This is a sequel done right and proves that The Avengers are the superheroes not to be reckoned with at the box office. This proves Marvel's high streak will last. Love them or hate them, this movie shows that they are capable of anything.",7
Big shoes to fill...,22 April 2015,"Overall, AoU was a good film... but given the last 2 Marvel movies that were released, the problem is that the expectations have grown tremendously. I thought CA:TWS and GOTG were absolutely incredible, and so, came into the cinema with possibly slightly inflated expectations. AoU delivered on most of those expectations... Here's 2 things that I thought let it down:

1) New characters - Not enough in terms of character development. There were far too many existing characters/new ones/returning ones bouncing around and time limitations (and this isn't a short movie either) basically meant that none of the new characters got developed enough... not even Ultron (IMO). It almost felt like they decided to throw in a paragraph for each new character and call it a day.

2) End Battle - Without giving away anything, I thought the final battle didn't feel like one. Something seemed lacking in terms of build up and peak... and as such it ended up feeling more like a large speed bump rather than a roller coaster.

Don't get me wrong though, as I mentioned earlier, everything else I expected out of an Avengers movie had its box ticked... I still enjoyed the movie. Just not as much as I would have if the 2 issues above were ironed out... It almost felt like Joss tried to do accomplish too much with this single movie; create Avengers movie, add new villain, add new characters (a bunch), add tie-ins, add forward links to next movies, etc. That said, I'm still excited to see what's next for Marvel.",8

"Movie Review: ""Avengers: Age of Ultron""",30 April 2015,,9
Avengers A--,22 April 2015,"""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" is a great mix of dark and fun at the same time, but does this film deliver after the whole Phase 2 build up? Does it surpass the original and live up to all our expectations? Sadly, we didn't get much of that

Before I start, I'd like to mention how hype does affect how a movie is viewed. AoU is clearly an extremely hyped film and must audiences expect it to even surpass the original. If the film does not deliver as expected then the film would considerably be underwhelming. In my own case I viewed the film to be exactly like that, I realized how my hype and expectations practically ruined most of the film for me as it didn't deliver as much. A second viewing might possibly do justice but it still left a mixed taste.

The Avengers are back and they now live and work together at the Avengers Tower. Right off the bat the opening shots of the Avengers fighting their way into Sokovia was brilliant and had a comic book feel to it. The whole movie had a huge comic book feel and spectacular visuals to accompany it. The movie also has a rather fast pacing and some things felt a little bit too rushed like Ultron suddenly becoming this strange and menacing villain within a few minutes. Speaking of Ultron, James Spader did a wonderful performance and Ultron and he strikes intimidation and personality that sets him different from other Marvel villains. My only issue with him as the villain is how he felt quite underdeveloped and kind of felt like his plot was just another generic villain plan, global destruction, their extinction, etc. The Avengers as individuals were developed really well in this film and characters like Hawkeye was more likable and notable in this film. Newcomers like Scarlet Witch, Quicksilver and Vision were excellent as well in their own parts. I particularly liked how the each Avengers were given a moment for themselves and how they all just break loose and see how they eventually team up again. I also liked how the Avengers would focus more on saving people rather than just causing massive destruction and not care about the people who are going to be affected by it (we're looking at you Man of Steel). There were some great back story thrown in the movie that intrigues us more towards some characters, well done cinematography and different music themes that accompany an Avenger individually. It is also notable how we are introduced to many things that will turn out to be crucial in future films, like a glimpse of Civil War or maybe a glimpse of the upcoming Infinity War.

As for the flaws. Some action scenes felt really dense at times especially the action sequence with the Ultron army. Sure I give credit to the rest of the action sequences which were intense and exciting excluding the final battle with the Ultron army. It really felt dense how these other Ultron robots felt really and I mean really vulnerable and you don't feel threatened when they come to our heroes because they easily beat them down much like the Chitauri army in the first film. There were also some holes that should've been covered in this film especially with what happened in previous phase 2 films. Like what happened with Cap and Falcon on their quest to find Bucky? Instead we see them chilling at the Avengers tower and it's not even mentioned. There was also a lot of Deus Ex Machinas in this films and one that particularly irritated me the most near the end. There's also a surprising relationship that sparks between two unlikely Avengers especially previous films at least hadn't suggested it at the most part. As stated, the pace of this film became quite a problem for me, you think the movie has just gotten in to 30 minutes and then you check your watch to see that the film has already gone a full hour and it really feels underwhelming.

Overall, an enjoyable popcorn flick movie to watch with your friends, it may feel underwhelming and contains several flaws but don't let the hype ruin the view of this film for you. If you will, a second viewing might simply do justice to it. +Comic Book Feel to it, +Ultron intimidating, +Development for our heroes, +Backstory, +Excellent and well handled newcomers, +Saving people, +Visuals, +Some great action sequences -Some dense action sequences -Fast pacing kind of ruins it, -Ultron feels quite underdeveloped, -Un suggested romance comes out of the blue, -Holes, -Deus Ex Machinas,

Verdict: 8.0/10",7
there are no strings to hold this movie down.,24 April 2015,"Once in a while a film comes around which raises your expectations so high and excites so much that it seems they cannot be exceeded so simply. Yet we are talking about a Marvel Cinematic Universe movie here, full of the fun, humour and characters that have never failed to disappoint before. I can safely say that my reasoning for Avengers Age of Ultron being my most anticipated film for 3 years is totally justified and it did not disappoint in any way. The emotions it left me feeling were some of the best i have felt for a long time and throughout i was smiling and felt like i was a member of the team Marvel have spent so long building up, and they are very much a team here taking us on a journey much bigger than the first and in many ways better.

The film opens with an incredible action sequence and stays that way until the very end of the post-credits scene which has become a staple at the very core of Marvel. Here Tony Stark has been working on a dormant peace keeping programme that is set to save the world so that the Avengers aren't needed anymore and can take a well deserved break. Enter Ultron, played as perfectly as a fan could wish for with the chilling voice of James Spader who gives real depth to a character who had to be done right to be brought to the screen. The Avengers assemble once again to counter Ultron who sees them as the only threat to the world he is sworn to protect and on the way encounter twins Scarlett Witch and Quicksilver who are insanely awesome characters. A lot of fans worried that Aaron-Taylor Johnson would be a disappointment compared to the perfect portrayal in last years Xmen film but i can say safely that they are two very different takes on Quicksilver and that they both did absolutely brilliant jobs. Elisabeth Olsen as Scarlett Witch again also provides us with a huge deal of depth and really makes the character her own. I must say though whilst everybody in the film, and i mean everybody, did a phenomenal job the standout is definitely Paul Bettany as the Vision. Without spoilers i can say without a doubt that he is the best character for me and is brought to the screen as perfectly as anyone could have imagined to counter the bad-ass Ultron. Joss Whedon gives it his all and that is definitely no understatement.

Each Avenger has their own demons to battle and we get to know them so much better than we already did. In particular what i loved was firstly the relationship between not only Bruce Banner and Black Widow but also the relationship she had with the Hulk. They played off each other so well. Black Widow really got to shine here. We knew the back stories of the Avengers because we got to see them in standalone films but hers is finally told to us and Scarlett Johansson brings a real feel of emotion to her character that we haven't previously gotten to know. We also get Thor who has demons to battle and we see more of an insight as to what is going on in his head and Captain America who is coming to grips with the life he has been given in modern times which was explored subtlety but very well. Also i know you are all wondering, yes the Iron man Hulkbuster vs Hulk fight was incredible and nothing short of spectacular. I loved Hulk in this film as he was more than the muscle of the team and the fight with Stark was given context instead of being thrown in for the fun of it (but that doesn't mean it isn't fun). Plus i was very happy to see Hawkeye was given a huge deal of screen time, he was bad-ass and shone a new light on him as a character which was awesome.

A couple minor flaws, but they are minor are that Ultron did have less screen time than i hoped. He was awesome but you almost want to see more by the conclusion. Also the post-credits scene was pretty cool but so short and i just wish i could have seen a little more in terms of set-up. Other than that you will not find a better time at the cinema and i doubt that will change for the rest of the year.

Avengers Age of Ultron is without a doubt my number one MCU film and featured all the action, humour and characters that we are promised and more. War Machine even shows up for the fun as well as Falcon even if only for a small time. Plus Nick Fury was as great as ever. All balanced with a slight dose of dark elements and we are given the perfect summer movie to enjoy again and again. Will be seeing it again on Sunday for sure. I am in love with everything about this film at the minute including the incredible soundtrack. ""Didn't see that coming?"" Neither did i. ""There are no strings on me"".",10
"Great action, lacked build-up",4 May 2015,"'Avengers: Age of Ultron' has a disadvantage to the first 'Avengers'-movie; namely that it ISN'T THE FIRST 'AVENGERS'-MOVIE. The first one could do with little plot (a simple MacGuffin chase), leaving a large chunk of the movie open for the characters to interact and explore each other - have a team being born. The sequel needed more than that - but did not quite deliver. All in all, it's a decent middle-episode of a series - but it lacks in rememberability.

Although there is some over-use of shaky-cam (hold the camera still, so we can actually take in what happens, for a change), the action is good to great. The movie tends to drag it a little - probably pandering to the 'Michael Bay'-like audience. The greatest problem of this film is the lack of build-up. Ultron was created to protect the world, but the second he erects he decides he should destroy it. Quicksilver and Scarlett Witch switch sides several times in the movie, without building up their motivation to do so.

The few times the movie does take its time to invest in the characters - it does so at the party and at the farm - it does it greatly. This is why I want to see the Avengers: because I like the characters, I want to explore them and know them better.

Also; there is great humor in this movie. There's a running gag of Captain America feeling uncomfortable with potty-mouth, which plays well into him being from the forties. Then, the running gag over Thor's hammer even gets to serve the plot - and Quicksilver's one-liner goes full-circle in the movie (according to the rule of three). Also, the movie does not only acknowledge its ridiculousness, it even celebrates it. That's something that could have salvaged 'Iron Man Three', where the movie asks us to take things serious that are too dumb for words.

And that brings us to 'Age of Ultron' in relation to the other MCU movies. Some things are glossed over or rushed, just like the evilness of Ultron. For instance: - The opening is a great action-wise (re)introduction to the Avengers... but why are they working together? They split up after the first 'Avengers'-movie, didn't they? And didn't Iron Man retire after IM3? - Apartently, Dr. Selvig went cuckoo after the first 'Avengers'- movie ~ as was depicted in Thor2. Now, when Thor comes to visit him (for a scene that stalled the movie instead of contributing to it), he appeared to be fine. - Didn't Iron Man get rid of his drone-suits when he retired at the end of IM3? Now, they're back.

Either they did the other movies wrong, or they should have taken time to get these things out of the way. Either way, it reeks of missed opportunity.

All in all, I don't feel that 'Age of Ultron' is 'The Empire Strikes Back' to the 'Avengers'' 'Star Wars'. Instead, it's a decent middle- of-the-season episode of a cool TV-series such as 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer'.",7
a train wreck,23 April 2015,,1
Avengers assemble again and it's awesome,9 May 2015,"The new Avengers movie is a worthy sequel to the first. It has great action, incredible visuals, compelling characters, and good humor.

The story/plot is one of the slight downfalls of this movie. The plot is there but it isn't strong or developed to it's full potential. It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't great either. One of the upsides though, is the constant humor. It is definitely a relief to have some humor in all the grittiness and darkness. The pacing is generally good but the beginning is just a tad slow. If you've seen previous Marvel movies then character development is just fine in this movie. If you're new to Marvel the character development will not seem so good. The chemistry between the Avengers felt natural and well developed. I also enjoyed seeing characters from other Marvel movies (War Machine, The Falcon) make an appearance in this movie.

This movie has some very talented cast members and they show their skills whether it's at humor, action, or interacting with others.

Joss Whedon did great with directing the first Avengers and he does another great job with the second. Even though he was exhausted by the end of making this movie, he still produced a fun action flick.

The action in this movie is insane. And it's where this movie is at its best. It's just a blast to watch especially the climatic scene at the end. I literally had goosebumps at times during the action. The visual effects are very impressive as well. From explosions and spaceships to flying superheroes and robots, it all looked great.

Some other highlights: Hawkeye being developed more. The Vision. War Machine. Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch.

In the end, the second Avengers movie is a worthy entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It had awesome action and visuals, cool characters, and good humor. Story and plot weren't the best but it didn't ruin the movie. I seriously doubted that this movie would live up to the first but I think it definitely did.",7
Great!,5 May 2015,,10
Great acting and cool effects but same old story.,4 May 2015,"To be honest, I was a little bit disappointed in the film. Don't get me wrong, I still enjoyed it, but the story was nothing new. You might argue that it's not much of the story that these comics/films are about, but rather the action and powers, but still, even in the comics there is progression and character development.

The visual effects was great as usual, and the action scenes pretty exciting. However, it seemed like the majority of the film either involved fighting or talking and that was pretty repetitive. It got a little tiresome watching fights and explosions, plus this time there was no charismatic, fun Loki to keep the film centred around. The film just basically had the same hurdle the avengers had to get through, which was to work together as a team.

Other than that, I liked how we had more of a glimpse into Hawkeye's life, as well as a more human view of Hulk and Black Widow. I was not expecting them to be inclined towards each other but it was cute.

The script seemed a bit much though. There was quite a few funny moments but in all it seemed like the writers added too many lines for each character just for the sake of laughter. Too many one liners and there wasn't much conversation between the characters as well. This also made it seem like the avengers were not that serious about the end of the world.

So in my opinion, the first avengers film was definitely much better. Though I still like this film, it didn't wow me, and it felt a little tiresome watching the fighting scenes again and again. Though I liked how a few of the other characters from their personal films appeared, and the addition of the Maximoff twins was interesting but could have been further explored.

"Don't ever listen to critics, go see it for yourself.",4 May 2015,"I'm going to be honest in my opinion. For the people who are movie goers and always want the super heroes movies to stay true to the comics, go home buy yourself a gun and kill yourself. Enjoy the movie for what it is. Super heroes movies will never stay true to the comics reason why is because maybe the comic storyline won't work either for the motion picture.

The movie was great, excellent action and fighting. I like how the story is going so far and how well the balance between the characters are with each other. Way better than the first avengers, and the vision is just amazing in every level. Can't wait for Galaxy Wars part 1 and 2",10
"It's fun and enjoyable, though the first Avengers is better",23 May 2015,"Well, we've all been super excited for this movie since the first Avengers came out. Does it meet the hype? Well no, not really. I did like the movie overall, but it certainly didn't meet my expectations and I thought the first Avengers was a much better movie. I think there are two main reasons why this movie wasn't as good as The Avengers. 1: We've seen all the Avengers together and fighting already. The novelty of seeing all those iconic characters in one movie has been lost. 2: This is ultimately a setup for other Marvel movies. Now you could argue every Marvel movie is a setup for the next one, but it felt way more prominent here. It seems the whole reason the film exists is to set up for the Civil War arc. I know it sounds like I'm trashing this movie, but I did actually enjoy it. The special effects are great and the action scenes are nothing short of awesome. It's not a terribly amazing film, but it's a fun Summer blockbuster and I think it's worth watching. (P.S. Days of Future Past Quicksilver was better).",7
And I'm sitting here wishing this liberal masterpiece wasn't over!,17 April 2015,"Where to start? First of all, Mrs. Joss Whedon you've done it again! I've been following this sh'man's work since Buffy and I still can't believe how consistently great, elegant, poetic, graceful, romantic, feminine yet hard, brutal, no holds barred, slamming, thrusting, dominating and masculating sh'is material has been. I come from a long line of men and women in my family and growing up around a strong female character such as my mother and a submissive yet nice guy character as my Dad, I came into my own character... I mean identity early in life. I understood immediately how a relationship between a man and a woman works and so began my long, hard, soft and wet foray into the more tasteful and equal parts of the artistic world in such mediums as cinema (or ""Kino"" for all you Krauts!), music, books, paintings, graphic novels, bicycles, cats and ethnic food.

This path eventually led me to the works of Joss Whedon. And this Whoa-Man (as in he's such a good writer it makes you go ""WHOA, MAN!"" but it's also a pun of the word woman because that's his favorite word) has taken the helm of Marvel's ultimate team of Superheroes: The Avengers! So here's the deal: How does Whedon write such strong female characters? You have Black Widow and let's be honest, even though her screen time and salary is a fraction of her male co-stars she still kicks ass as in the woman can really fight! But wait, it doesn't end there because we're introduced to Scarlet Witch and guess what? she kicks ass, too in her collected 10 minutes of screen time! she has strong, telekinetic, female character powers. And let's not forget S.H.I.E.L.D Agent Maria Hill who only has a combined screen time of maybe 5 minutes in a 140 minute movie but you know what? when she shows up, she kicks ass! There's so much girl power in this movie that you instantly forget that the rest of the characters taking up a majority of the film's running time are male. But we have a big bad wolf in the film's main villain: Ultron. This pulsing man-machine symbol of the Patriarchy is on a throbbing rampage to destroy the entire world. Typical male, am I right? *owl face. Ultron tears and rips through so many walls, pounding and destroying whatever is spread out in front of him you almost think no one has a chance.

Then something glorious happens in the character of Vision. Like an angel he gracefully enters an opening in the story with such a delicate touch, slow yet careful and with passion and a most extreme sensual connection he helps the Avengers to defeat Ultron. But of course it wouldn't be Whedon if a woman wasn't there to aid him because Scarlet Witch is also a big factor in the big, exploding climax. She absolutely gushes with such power that the combined force of her and Vision opens up a whole new, unlabeled form of partnership that has yet to buzz up in our own society. These characters are the absolute objects of my affection

If you want a definition of Whedon's artistic vision you would be wrong to think it was lumpy, pasty, receding in quality, or sausagely-fingered in its themes as that would be shaming his entire body of work. His career is to define what it is to be a woman and I haven't seen equality like this since the outcome of Roe v Wade. The Bodhi Dharma once said: ""Nobody can give you freedom. Nobody can give you equality or justice or anything. If you're a man, you take it"". I imagine when he put down his writing chopstick afterwards he never would have thought his words would give a natural birth to the baby mind of one Joss Whedon. Keep on writing, Mister Sister 'cuz, baby, you're a firefly!",10
No Strings on Me,17 May 2015,"Greetings again from the darkness. Joss Whedon returns as writer/director for the sequel to his 2012 blockbuster The Avengers, and this time he juggles an exceptionally large and talented group of characters and actors who are not only involved in good versus evil, but also in the battle for screen time.

There is no shortage of write-ups from film critics and fanboys who have analyzed every aspect of the movie from every possible angle, and while I admit to taking that same approach to most movies, there is something about the Marvel movies that cause me to flip off the film critic part of my brain and just sit back and enjoy. And enjoy I do. The characters are fun and interesting and the action is at time breath-taking.

Since there are, by my count, at least 23 actors who deserve mention, it makes little sense for me to list them here. It is worth noting that the key actors all reprise their roles as Avengers, and many of those in supporting roles are back as well. This time there are also many significant newcomers, and those include ""The Twins"" – Aaron Taylor-Johnson as Quicksilver and Elizabeth Olsen as Scarlet Witch. Other newbies include Linda Cardellini (""Mad Men"","" Bloodline"") as Hawkeye's wife, Claudia Kim as Dr Helen Cho, Thomas Kretschmann as Strucker, and Andy Serkis as Ulysses Klaue. Though each is a nice addition, it's the stellar voice work of James Spader as Ultron that really makes this movie click. Somehow Mr. Spader manages to convey a powerful presence despite maintaining a (mostly) even keel throughout. It's masterful voice acting.

Missing this time out are Pepper Potts and Loki, though we hardly notice thanks to the first look at Vision (Paul Bettany) and Thanos (Josh Brolin)  plus the unveiling of Iron Man's Hulkbuster armor. If you thought the first Avengers movie made it difficult to keep up with the characters, this one will have your head spinning. It's probably the only quibble I have with it  character overload at the expense of character development. The Hawkeye family farm represents a meager attempt to have this group of superheroes set in a ""normal"" environment, but it just doesn't quite work. The Avengers are at their best while snipping at each other or saving the planet  fortunately the movie offers plenty of the latter.",7
Avengers: Age of Ultron 2015 Review,16 February 2021,"This movie deserves more credit then it's given. Coming off of the first Avengers film, sure this is a step down, but Age of Ultron is still full of solid action, good humor, and amazing superhero synergy. Even with the new additions, Paul Bettanys Vision, Elizabeth Olsen's Wanda Maximoff, and James Spaders Ultron, this movie does an amazing job of meshing all these new characters in with the old. Ultron in this movie felt like another Mandarin (Iron Man 3). But in my opinion, the change of character and James Spaders voice acting works amazingly for this character and makes him extremely memorable.

My only complaint would be Aaron Taylor Johnson's Quicksilver, he's definitely nothing to write home about. His character is extremely lackluster and only used to serve a minor part of the plot at the end (not talking about the implications that come from WandaVision), and when compared to Evan Peters Quicksilver from the Fox X-Men movies: it's a major step down.",8
"Good, but felt like a missed opportunity",15 May 2015,"The good:

-The action. It's what we all came for. Some sequences are spectacular.

-New characters. I liked the ""twins"" and even though they barely scratched the surface with their story, it was more compelling than those of any of the Avengers. The Vision was also pretty cool, but alas they did nothing with him

The bad:

-Unfortunately there were quite a few battles that were very meh. The final battle was chaotic and not that exciting.

-Ultron sucked. He starts as a ""Frankenstein's monster"" type of villain seeking to punish his creator. This would be really cool. But as the movie goes on he becomes a cookie cutter cackling bad guy. Tony and Ultron never really talk. The implications of his horrible creation are never explored. He just doesn't care and an enriching storyline is completely ignored.

-Spends too much time on uninteresting story lines, and neglects the interesting ones. The superpower twins' background with Tony Stark was fresh, but it never went anywhere. And the Vision could have been a real standout in the movie. An android with heightened awarenes. His few scenes where he gets to talk are interesting. He reminded me of Doctor Manhattan in Watchmen. But he just shows up to kick some ass and nothing else. Why have all these new characters if they serve no purpose?

While the above characters are swept aside, the movie somehow sees fit to waste plenty of time at a farm and on pointless side-errands for the main characters. It's really baffling.

-Too much humour. There are a LOT of one-liners and jokes. Most fall flat and most are inappropriately placed in that they kill any tension or thrills. I get it's a lighthearted movie, but the constant wisecracking got a bit much.

Overall, I enjoyed this movie, the action was pretty good but couldn't help feeling as I left the theatre that it could have been a lot more.",6
"Everything a superhero movie has, but not what it needs",10 May 2015,,1
disappointment,9 May 2015,"Since the first trailer came out in late summer 2014, I could not wait for this movie. I do not like the Avengers, but Ultron looked like a real cool villain in the trailers. The movie comes out and I purchase tickets ahead of time, go see the movie, and... Avengers 2 was not what I expected. I was hoping it would be as good as the first Avengers but unfortunately it was not. There was a lot of action and a lot of jokes, it felt like I was watching a comedy at times. Even Ultron was making jokes, seriously? Marvel is making movies for kids now. If Marvel keeps making movies like this, DC will be taking over the big screen very soon. I honestly can say the best part of the whole night was the Batman v Superman trailer.",6
Overwhelming but entirely marvelous and spectacular,29 April 2015,"*** I must mention ..DO not miss the beginning.Its MINDBLOWING*** I do not understand all the negative talk.. lets accept this..Joss Wheadon has achieved the impossible, getting together the favorite superheros with their emotions and souls on single screen and did an impeccable job at that. How do you expect the story to progress if you just want to see the same Avengers one movie in 2nd one as well? The problem here is think that no one wants to see a super hero having an emotional side and a their own life. If first movie was about getting them together, 2nd movie is about exploring them beyond their superhero facet. One cant help but feel bad for Bruce Banner and Natasha for all they wanted was little more life than being bad-ass superheros but can only dream about it. The beautiful sibling bonding between Scarlett witch and quick silver.Tony setting the stage for another war with ""accidental"" creation Evil AI Ultron. Thor , Captain doing their parts as expected . Finally it was refreshing to see Barton having a life and a story line!

Its a feel good movie,brilliant visuals,spectacular screen presence of every single superhero and every character helps movie move further and sets tone for next sequel.

Just ignore all the reviews, go with an open mind and enjoy the movie. You wont be disappointed.",10
McGuffins assembled,2 May 2015,"Avengers: Age of Ultron is nonsense. But it is glossy, well-packaged and star-studded nonsense.

Following on from the defeat of Thor's brother in the last film, the story revolves around Loki's staff, an object of unspeakable power, which in a blitzkrieg of special effects is repatriated by the Avengers from a mountain fortress in a fictitious Sokovia. Instead of doing the sensible thing and crating it up in a warehouse with the Ark of the Covenant, the boffin duo of Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jnr) and David Banner (Mark Ruffalo) try to harness its power through their super-computer Jarvis (voiced by Paul Bettany) to create a peace-keeping AI machine called Skynet, no sorry - wrong film - Ultron. This will allow them to all retire and lie on a beach somewhere, so in a way the whole plot is really about pension planning.

Everything naturally turns pear-shaped when Ultron (like V'gur in Star Trek 1) decides that eradication of human life seems the most sensible course of action. It's now down to The Avengers to put right the damage they've done.

I'm not a 'fan-boy' or even a 'fan-man', so a lot of the back stories of ""SHIELD' and the villainous Baron von Strucker went completely over my head. But these details really don't matter: it's not bloody Shakespeare. More perplexing are some of the diversions the film takes and the questions these raise:



So many questions with no answers in the convoluted screenplay by Joss Whedon (who also directed).

What kept the film entertaining, to a point, was the incessant banter between the characters, some of which worked and some of which didn't. So much banter in fact I expected Chandler Bing to be credited as a co-screenwriter. An Excaliber-style segment with Thor's hammer is particularly entertaining.

Special effects are of the frantic 'what the hell is going on on the screen' variety. Where these work best is in the impressive slow-mo segments, notably a 'money-shot' in the opening of the film with all Avengers on the screen and a later fight scene in a Sokovian tower.

All the acting is of the quality you would expect from the star-names on show, although many in the cast (e.g. Samuel L Jackson, Don Cheadle, Andy Serkis, Stellan Skarsgård and Idris Elba) have little more than cameo parts. In particular I wanted to see more of Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen), the latter being mesmerising (in every sense of the word) in every scene she is in.

Overlong, at 141 minutes, this is a film squarely aimed at a teenage audience (who will no doubt love it) and old folks who are looking for a quieter and more sedate movie should flee far from this madding crowd. I had low expectations of this film, but as an early summer popcorn blockbuster it is not as bad as I expected it to be. Whatever I comment, however, is completely irrelevant as it is going to make a shed-load of money at the box office. With a budget of $250 million, it needs to, but as the first film grossed $1,500 million - the third highest in movie history - it's probably a safe enough bet for the producers.

Marvel rescued blockbuster-cinema,25 April 2015,"Nothing more, nothing less.

Hollywood was out of idead, until Marvel became company with Disney and created a masterplan for a saga containing some of the greatest stories in comicbook-history onto celluloid...a few years ago everyone would have said: ""Impossible to do"".

Now the Infinity-Gauntlet-story gets more and more real, including the Civil-Wars, Ragnarök and more of the most complex comicbook- sagas into ONE big masterplan.

Every other studio tries no to create it's own universe, it revoluted blockbuster-history, and I dare to say it saved cinema for a long time.

AoU is no exception: (I want to exclude spoilers) So many big names, characters and story are meanwhile puzzled to one highly anticipated climax, which becomes reality in a few years.

I'm deeply impressed and say one thing to the Americans, who will see AoU from next week on: The first Avengers was a small French comedy compared to AoU.

It's spectacular, overloaded and FULLY comic-related.

Of course there are plot holes, logical errors etc., that's cinema. But the way HOW the story evolves to a common sense, the way it was planned before, the way fresh characters continue hooking on the Saga-train...there is no comparable example to this.

The MCU and the Infinity-Gauntlet-story has it's place in Cinema- history already.

Of course DC can make it better, there is still improvement-space left. But Marvel started it all...many thanks to Kevin Feige and his ideas!",10
"An Overblown, Overcrowded & Convoluted Mess!",24 May 2015,"What actually made The Avengers click so amazingly well with audience around the globe wasn't its simple accumulation of many superheroes in one feature but the flawless manner in which director Joss Whedon blended the elements of action, humour & drama into one perfectly balanced extravaganza that offered plenty of laughs, spectacle, emotions, entertainment & satisfaction throughout its runtime.

Riding on the wonderful platform provided to it by earlier instalments, the second phase of Marvel Cinematic Universe has had a smooth run in both critical & commercial departments until it all came down to the chapter everyone had been waiting for since the past 3 years. And even although at first Avengers: Age of Ultron may seem like another success story for Marvel, it is unfortunately way too messed up in actuality.

Sequel to The Avengers, penultimate chapter of Marvel's Phase Two plan & eleventh film in Marvel Cinematic Universe, Avengers: Age of Ultron brings back the team of Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, Hulk, Black Widow & Haweye under one roof once again for this time they face an adversary they never saw coming as Tony Stark's dormant peacekeeping program goes horribly wrong, resulting in the birth of Ultron who's hellbent on human extinction.

Written & directed by Joss Whedon, almost all the things that one suspected to go wrong in The Avengers goes wrong in this sequel as Age of Ultron is an overblown, overcrowded & extremely convoluted mess of an action-adventure that neither succeeds in finding the perfect balance between its different elements nor provides a smooth flow to its narrative like the way it did in its predecessor. And even his direction looked tiresome as if he simply wanted to finish the film anyhow & go home.

While the story does head into a darker territory this time, adds greater depth to the arcs of subordinate members of the Avengers & brims with cleverly executed moments of wit, it's the complete lack of coherence that hurts this film most. The heaviness of the opening act, the nonsensical incarnation of Ultron, the over-reliance on CGI action, the uneven switching between different plot points & several wrong turns that ultimately lead to an uninspiring finale are a few things that negatively affect the whole experience.

The writing is another culprit for the new characters are poorly handled, the plot line is quite banal, the action is soulless and although the screenplay boasts a few interesting ideas on paper, its execution on the film canvas is an absolute disappointment. Camera-work is pretty chaotic but the visual look is commendable, Editing is bothersome for the story isn't supposed to be this long n tiresome, and even the background score is simply a rehash of the original that brings nothing new to the table.

Coming to the performances, there isn't really much to add about the reprising cast except for the characters of Scarlett Johansson & Jeremy Renner, as we find out more about their backgrounds. Among the new additions, James Spader plays Ultron & even if his voice brings a compelling quality to his character, its poor conception in the script prevents him from becoming a formidable villain while Aaron Taylor-Johnson & Elizabeth Olsen do a fine job in the role of Quicksilver & Scarlet Witch, respectively.

On an overall scale, Avengers: Age of Ultron is a disappointing follow-up to The Avengers that collapses under the burden of its own ambitions in a spectacular fashion. Even though it never advertised itself as anything more than a popcorn entertainer but it is only sensible to expect a sequel that's on the same radar as its predecessor. I don't know if it's the after- effects of Mad Max: Fury Road that had me totally numb to the CGI-heavy sequences this film had in store or if those moments really are lifeless but purely from storytelling aspect, Avengers: Age of Ultron certainly isn't one of Marvel's finest offerings.",
A little short of the first but a solid entertainer none-the-less,26 April 2015,"In a way, it was inevitable. The massive expectations from the sequel to the $1.5 billion grossing and incredibly charming Avengers had shot up so high, the movie was bound to disappoint at some level. And at some level it does, though not to the extent that it can be called a grossly underwhelming disappointment as is being hailed by the media and professional critics. The movie does have its moments, it works for the most part, but just falls short of the first one. In the interest of North American viewers who get this flick a week after international viewers, I'll keep this review completely spoiler free while hoping that it doesn't feel too generic.

The movie's plot, no matter how well written, is pretty standard science-fiction stuff: A robot decides that eliminating humans is the best way to achieve worldwide peace and begins by hatching a scheme to start by eliminating humanities saviors first - The Avengers. That two of the Aveners themselves are responsible for its creation could make for an interesting face off between the creator and the creation. Except that it doesn't.

One of the complains I have with this one is that the dialogue didn't feel as sharp as the first one. In The Avengers, Tony Stark for instance had some amazing lines and so did Steve Rogers. And their banter, while pretty interesting, was entirely in character. Here, both characters seem to have lost their wit / charm. Now fans may justify this as a result of what these characters went through in their respective standalone films but I feel the writing has a lot to blame. Stark's dialogue during the Hulk v/s Hulkbuster fight sequence is an example; his lines are so bland and generic that Downey himself could have done better if he had simply improvised.

Something similar applies to the film's humor; while there were sequences of absolute hilarity amongst the characters in the first film, most of the humor falls flat in this one. All these minor squabbles could have been forgotten if the movie had a great plot. But with something like a robot out for human extinction ending in an equally generic save the city standoff make these flaws stand out even more.

Most movies with a mediocre plot manage to compensate for their shortcomings through some spectacular action sequences. This however, is not Age Of Ultron's strong point either. Most of the action is too heavily edited to be able to follow and the ones you can seem like they were designed by the visual effects crew on an ad hoc basis. And its about time Marvel did away with Brian Tyler and brought a different composer to the mix; the only good themes heard in Age Of Ultron are the ones lifted straight from Alan Silvestri's score in The Avengers and Danny Elfman's slightly modified version of Silvestri's Avengers Theme. Compared to the first one's score which was much more memorable, this one's rather forgetful. And despite a 140 minute runtime, a lot of sequences feel rushed. I guess this has to do with Whedon trying his best to give every character his due and should this movie have an extended edition, it would certainly be one to watch out for.

Now that all the negative stuff is out, here are some of the positives. First off is Ultron and Spader's terrific portrayal of the robotic psychopath (that voice) and Whedon's terrific treatment. Despite his rather clichéd mission, Spader and Whedon make Ultron sound utterly convincing and at times, logical when things are viewed from his perspective. He wants to eradicate humanity so its rather obvious to start with the ones who guard it - The Avengers. Also well done are some bits with Thor's hammer and the following which stand out.











When The Avengers came out back in 2012, the kind of shared universe cross-referencing was a novelty that made it an event. It was as close to comic books as movies could get in terms of continuity. With so many shared universes announced, it seems that this novelty factor has wore off resulting in Age Of Ultron a good movie but not a great one. It is certainly a treat that comic-book fans owe themselves and the comic-book audience has a lot to cheer for. For the casual moviegoer, this will just be another good movie. Regardless, critics be damned and tomato-meter scores aside, this is a movie you should not miss.

I'm heavily conflicted between scoring this with a 7.0 or a 7.5. I'll stick with a 7.0 for now and revisit the rating after subsequent re-viewings !!!

Overall Score: 7.0 / 10.0",7
Avengers Assemble...Again!!!,30 April 2015,,10
Amazing scenes but felt that story was lacking. *SPOILERS*,4 May 2015,,7
"Action-packed, dramatic and funny in all the right places.",15 October 2015,"Avengers: The Age of Ultron is the sequel to the fourth highest grossing movie of all time. At the risk of over-hyping it any more, I can say it's probably the best Marvel movie to date. It manages to be action-packed, dramatic and even very funny in all the right places.

After the Avengers lead a successful raid against a Hydra outpost, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) revives his secret peacekeeping program Ultron (voiced by James Spader) to help safeguard the planet from evil. However, Ultron interprets the idea of keeping Earth safe as a need to eradicate humankind from existence. Ultron shortly escapes from Stark's laboratory to act out its mission and it's up to the Avengers, along with their new allies, the twins Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) to stop Ultron from carrying out this genocidal act.

Even though it is darker than the first film, Avengers: The Age of Ultron is still able to capture the charm and humour from its main characters that we have grown to love over the years. Tony Stark is still as witty as ever, delivering his trademark hilarious one-liners and Hawkeye's (Jeremy Renner) scenes have some of the most poignant moments in any Marvel film. But perhaps the biggest surprise were the twins Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch, who played a much more important role than I thought they would. There's rarely a dull moment.

I rate it 9/10, a bit higher than its predecessor, which I rated 8.5/10.",9
Not quite as expected,23 April 2015,"I had been looking forward to this movie for a long time, and I'm kinda sad that I didn't enjoy it as I thought I would. Honestly I don't know what to think about this movie, let alone what to say. But I will give it a try.

Everything happens either too slow or too fast. Most things are unexplained, and the rest seems like they are forced to be that way. I had to wonder ""Is anything actually happening??"" at some scenes, and then just one moment later when something happened, I was all like ""What the hell just happened???"". Very confusing.

But the action is good. So is the humor. So I gave this movie 7/10 for being decent.",7
"Dull and Bland, and Pointless",18 May 2015,,1
All hail the new KING! The best comic book movie ever made.,24 April 2015,"Yes, the title says it all. All hail the new KING! I'm not saying this to anger any fan of other franchises but I'd have to rate Age of Ultron a true 10/10 masterpiece and THE best comic book movie ever made. Much like the first Avengers, it is as close to a perfect movie as you can get regardless of the genre. In fact, I consider this effort superior to that first film and I didn't think that was even possible. As has been noted before, Superman had generally held the title as most fondly remembered or nostalgic superhero film flaws and all. Spider-Man had generally held the title as most beloved superhero film because of the character and the time it hit. (Yet, those two awful reboot movies are definitely something the character needs to shake off at this point) TDK had held the title as the most rabidly defended superhero movie from its fan base. Iron Man had generally held the title as best all-around origin film. Captain America The Winter Soldier added its own unique flavor and vaulted to the head of most people's ""best sequel"" list. However, I can honestly say that Avengers Age of Ultron tops them all in every single category. It is IMO shear perfection on every level. It's smart, intense, well acted, thrilling, fun and superbly done.

I'm confident that when all is said and done this film will be thought of as the best of all-time.",
Pure Marvel Money Making 'Gimmick',30 April 2015,"Cheap jokes that are getting awfully boring now; A villain made by one of the Avengers in the most amateurish way possible (and without any sort of basic plot development) and who should have been more developed as a character. A plot that is thin with loopholes and beautiful 'conveniences'. Weird plot additions which are incongruous.Animation/CG that itself looks funny at times (like when Ultron speaks). And all coming together like a complete formula which is getting terribly banal.

Of course, most of us have seen other films in the Marvel universe and so probably will go see this one as well and others in future. But unlike Captain America the Winter Soldier or Guardians of The Galaxy, this one is just not up to the mark.

Maybe it's time to see what DC does.",6
A dream come true!,23 April 2015,"I used to think making a better film than the Avengers was quite impossible, but Joss Whedon did it! Avengers: Age of Ultron is a dream come true, the sequel all the fans were waiting for, and inarguably the best Marvel film to date - maybe even better than Guardians of the Galaxy.

The film still has all the elements of the first film, but it makes a huge step forward in the action - the 3D vision is totally worthy - dialogue and character. However, the main difference is the villain: James Spader's Ultron is marvelous.

The talk about artificial intelligence is very fascinating, both conceptually and cinematically.The storyline is far from the cliché superhero story. The script is great and amusing. The direction of Joss Whedon is flawless. There is a great balance within the Avengers, where the superiority of Iron Man, Captain America, Thor and Hulk is perfectly balanced with the more active roles of Black Widow and Hawkeye - I would have loved to see more Falcon though. I loved what they did with The Vision, The Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver.

All the actors gave a fantastic performance. Robert Downey Jr. keeps on playing the genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist in a way nobody else could. Chris Evans always brings a sense of honor to his character. Scarlett Johansson really surprised me. Great performances also from Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo, Jeremy Renner, Samuel L. Jackson, Cobie Smulders and Paul Bettany. Elizabeth Olsen gives one of the best new character portrayals in recent year - I really want to see more of her Scarlet Witch. However, James Spader totally steals the scene: he is perfect.

Fizzles when it should pop,2 May 2015,"The ""Avengers"" films, and the films of Marvel in general, play less like films and more like large-scale business investments that need to churn an unfathomable amount of money (think north of $1.5 billion) to even be considered a success. When film becomes that expensive and driven by finances, to me, it's no longer an act of entertainment but an act of business and a potentially crippling investment. The Marvel brand, in general, while showing no signs of letting up at the box office, has made me weary over the last two years, as I've been straining to find a great deal of satisfaction in most of the two to three superhero films released every year. To call this genre much of a muchness is still shortchanging in how its repetition hurts the individual impact of each of these films for me.

Joss Whedon's ""Avengers: Age of Ultron,"" I thought, would be the exception; after disillusionment with ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier,"" ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2,"" and ""Iron Man 3,"" I was hoping I'd emerge from the sequel gleaming with joy as I did with the first film. However, ""Age of Ultron"" doesn't escape the same kind of issues the former films had; familiarity continues to breed contempt, repetitive quips and attempt at humor distract from core character relations, and candy-colored action that undermines the talent at hand.

The film concerns the same Avengers team as last time: Iron Man (Robert Downey, Jr.), Captain America (Chris Evans), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) all assemble once more to make up the beloved superhero team. However, this time, the team needs to find a way to assemble and be strong enough to take down Ultron (James Spader), an artificially intelligent villain who is created through technology to try and erase human extinction. Even with six of them, however, the Avengers find themselves still underpowered in the face of Ultron's immense technological presence. The film concerns their efforts to take down the villain, whilst coming to realize just what their lives and existence means for the face of humanity.

The original ""Avengers"" packed in some terrific character relations; it was fascinating to see how all these superheros would interact with one another, constantly trying to one up their peers and stand tall in the face of everything. ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" worked to expand this feature in a sillier way, but still worked on the level of helping us relate to these larger than life figures. One scene in this film, I recall, has these characters interacting at leisure, and it takes place in a lavish penthouse after a party with all of the Avengers attempting to lift Thor's hammer. Whedon goes for the kill with this film, infusing a great deal of action sequences rather than focusing on the graceful character presence that made the first ""Avengers"" so fun. In both that film and ""Guardians,"" we felt like we were hanging out with these heroes; now, we're back to passively observing them at work.

With that, it's amazing to see Whedon, who kept the humor in the first ""Avengers"" to a minimum, only pulling it out on certain occasions, usually to great effect, rely so heavily on quips here. It seems nearly every scene has to end with some kind of forced jab or one-liner, especially a desperately unfunny recurring joke made by Captain America in the opening scene about the use of bad language. These kinds of things only distract from what Whedon does well, particularly here, where those things are masked by other, lesser features.

For one, Whedon continues to prove, from both a screen writing and directorial standpoint, that he can juggle chaos. Whedon can habdle about five or six things going on in terms of tying them together when the time comes and capturing such chaos as it's unfolding before us. Sometimes, one needs to just sit back in pure awe at the camaraderie occurring before us and marvel at its visual coherency thanks to Whedon's careful hand. In addition, ""The Avengers"" addresses the weaknesses of the team, despite having six superheros working together. The invincibility element of Marvel superheros has continuously been a distracting element for me, with each passing Marvel film, in that I rarely feel a sense of danger for these characters because it seems as if nothing can stop them.

In ""Age of Ultron,"" we actually see the Avengers struggle to adequately assemble to take down Ultron, even going as far as to vacationing to a resort in order to further strengthen and develop. This element of questioning just how strong these six heroes are is something that this extended universe needed.

""Avengers: Age of Ultron,"" especially for possibly setting forth new standards for blockbusters in terms of budget, gross, and scope, is still an underwhelming experience. For a film so grand in its vision and limitless with its roster, it feels so grounded in routine, Marvel formula, so much so that the end battle treads dangerously close to not only being boring but riddled with the same kind of ""Transformers""-esque excess that, again, could set a dangerous precedent. Whedon must be admired here, mainly for his craft at handling a great deal of things going on in unison along with his efforts to question the Avengers' invincibility, but considering this is time when the series should take off in the way of ""The Empire Strikes Back,"" the fact that it wobbles and fizzles in impact is a tad frightening.",6
The Beginning to the End,30 April 2015,,9
A Massive Improvement From The First One,25 April 2015,"Going in to see this film I knew it was going to be something special. With Joss Whedon directing again and three new Avengers coming in to fight crime. There was no way this film was going to be a disaster.

Acting - 6/10

This movie has a bunch of extremely famous and well-known actors leading it, which means that the acting should be really good but unfortunately it isn't. I don't want to blame the actors themselves because in their solo movies they act extremely well. When the movie starts off the acting is almost on the same level as The Expendables acting, with cheesy one-liners that make you cringe constantly. Thankfully the acting does improve after the first scene has ended and the real story is about to begin. I think that it was either the directing or writing that caused this poor acting, so it's really hard to blame the actors themselves.

Writing - 6/10

There's nothing special in the writing just you'r usual poorly written Marvel superhero movie.

VFX - 8/10

The visual effects in this are nice to look at and obviously took a lot of work but there isn't anything ground breaking or spectacular in it. It closely resembles the visual effects of the Transformers which is disappointing because it reminded me of how terrible those movies were, but other than that they were great.

Characters - 9/10

The characters are extremely likable which has already been established in all of the other films and they don't really develop in this film at all which is disappointing. The film does however included probably the best villain in a Marvel film so far which is Ultron. Ultron is extremely menacing and if he was written properly he would have sent shivers down everybody's spines. The problem with Ultron is that Joss Whedon though that he should act goofy to add a comedic element which almost ruins his character all together and almost.... just almost stops him being as menacing as he is.

Story - 5/10

The story is extremely disappointing because guess what... the bad guy tries to blow up earth again!. Seriously they need to stop with this formula of blowing earth up, it's just plain boring. They even did exactly the same thing in the first Avengers!.

Overall - 8

A massive improvement from the first film but sadly isn't re- watchable. I recommend everyone to see it as it is a very fun fast- paced film that is enjoyable, but sadly doesn't have anything special added in. Go and watch it to make up you'r own opinion :)",6
Incredibly well written,18 October 2015,"When I first saw this in the theatre, I thought it was too busy and Spader was a little cartoony. But on first viewing you're always comparing it to the original, so you need a time to step back. Now, I see how well written it is and how the humor really fits perfectly, considering Ultron is Stark's alter ego. I also never really thought much of Scarlett as an actor, but her scene at the beginning with the lullaby really showed an incredible range of emotions in just a small scene with great subtly. All of this is a result of great writing, both in story line and dialog, along with everyone of the actors being first rate. I'm glad to finally see comic book movies reaching the intelligence of their source material. I'm not a comic book geek but a movie lover, so I don't have any of the preconceived prejudices. I could go on and on about all the subtle inferences to modern day terrorism and America's role as the world's bully and hated cop, but I just wanted to give it the positive review it deserves.",10
"A little rough around the edges, otherwise fine.",23 April 2015,,7
Extremely entertaining! A worthy sequel to an already great film.,3 May 2015,,9
all too quick ...made just for the sake of it..,2 May 2015,"Avengers, Age of Ultron, good for a normal superhero flick, but in reality it was nothing more than a movie forcefully made..... Yes, the characters developed way to fast and Marvel seemed like they a train to catch... They made this movie simply becoz its been too long since the last avengers movie ( which was ,miles ahead in storyline and concept compared to AoU)

The positive points though- Thor and Captain Americas teamwork in the fight sequences and Spaders spine chilling voice... ‪#wooho‬ ‪#nostringsattached‬..

Hulk was as sad as it can be, sulking throughout the movie, ( oh and piloting the avengers jet too, just imagine ) Thor knowing about the gems from the guardians of the galaxy movie , god knows how ( perhaps he is the god and he is supposed to know everything, this weird Odinson ;p)...

Wishlist for the next edition- a badass Thanos( no comic elements please) , no cheesy one liners, no Spiderman ( this is a request to all the gods from all the realms), some more avengers blood, some dark history ( the director promised , he failed here), a glimpse of Magneto taking revenge for his sons death and becoming a sort of anti hero or something( this ain't happening but no harm hoping)... *in the Slovakian accent* - u dint see that coming???

AoU disappointed a me a bit , but the movie wasn't boring either... Dunno how time passed but also kept me waiting for more at times ( yes Natalie Portman wouldve done the little trick)... The company, the food and the ambiance made it worthwhile for me...",7
Age of Dulltron,1 May 2015,,1
"A bowl of overcooked,convoluted,entertaining mess",6 May 2015,"Right off the bat I can say one thing without any hesitation. I enjoyed watching this movie. It was supposed to be linear summer blockbuster flick meant to cash in on the now highly maximized marvel fan base. Joss Whedon to be honest was at his best while making this movie. I have watched this movie twice. My first viewing as a normal 3d movie and my second in IMAX, thus my review is pretty much an in depth analysis about the movie and a lot of it's aspects that grew on me, in the bad way. Throughout this review, my statements might sound a bit nit picky but these aspects really pushed me out of the overall experience of the movie as a whole.

1) Casting and Characterisation: - I have absolutely no problem with the returning avenger crew. They were fantastic back in 2012; they are equally fantastic and dynamic now. The first party scene in the movie shows the relationship and chemistry amongst the old returning crew and highlighting the brilliant work done by the casting crew previously. Talking about new comers, James Spader was spectacular. Ever since the first time I viewed him in the Office and Blackhat, I knew he was perfect for the role o this menacing baddie . With what was given to him by script and what he executed, he was generally flawless. But the incoherent plot script and rushed narrative didn't flush out his character to the fullest throwing down the brilliant opportunity to make him a very memorable villain, which I will be explaining later in depth in this review. Also Quicksikver is not as good as the days of future past iteration.

2) Story, Screenplay and Plot: - This is the basic reason why my rating for this movie is as low as 6/10. Everything wrong and bitter about this movie lies with the unnecessarily over convoluted, incoherent and unexplained plot that drove me crazy on the first viewing.

i) How and why did tony start making his suits again after the end of iron man 3? ii) What was the compelling reason why Ultron became that menacing? iii) Why and how did the relationship between Natasha and Bruce crop up?

It just feels as if the whole movie was just rushed to the audience as if Disney is sitting back in their office and saying, "" They will pay us and watch it anyways "". Seriously! The love story between Bruce and Natasha for that matter is so underdeveloped and cooked. I didn't see any chemistry between them in previous movies, at least not something that could bring up this love story into light. The biggest point of the movie, the reason why this movie was made, Ultron was just scrapped completely and misused by Joss. Ultron quite literally comes in the beginning of the movie, gives a vague reason, turns ultra menacing, builds more of his kind and plans a world destruction scheme all with absolutely no character development. It's shameful to see this happen especially with someone as good as James Spader in the shoes. Hulk and Thor were also left back, especially Hulk put into the stupid mess of a love story I didn't give two damns about. It is really frustrating to see such missed opportunities here. The whole movie is one bowl of ambitious but overcooked plot that Joss Whedon thought it would be okay to put some more darkness and gritty plot actions to make this movie something really dark and aggressive. Thus on a whole not as good as the first one.

3) Direction: - I need to give a shout out to Whedon though for putting his best efforts to bring in the crew again into the screen to make this a compelling movie. The charm of seeing these heroes assemble was gone with the first one, and Joss Whedon has done a brilliant job fulfilling a tough task to make these characters feel relevant again as a crew. The action is superb. I loved every moment of action in the movie; in fact Joss was clever to add in an explosive scene every time you say "" WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT? "" about the plot to keep to attracted to the movie. The first battle with Ultron was a bit over the top I felt, but nonetheless kept me at the edge of the seat. I still don't understand how many of the heroes don't exactly get hurt or injured towards the end. Kudos again to Joss who even under Disney's pressure didn't back away from showing causalities and death in this movie unlike the first one where every citizen was conveniently alive. And the hulk buster fight, if that was the only thing in the movie I would give this a 10. On a whole, yes great director, no for a screenwriter or script writer for that matter.

On an overall, the movie is a mess. I don't go into a theater to see explosions every 2 or 3 minutes and feel satisfied with that. I am disappointed about the fact that though this movie could not live up to the first one, the crew did an awful job at including the thrilling charm and vibe of the first movie's villain and his motives into this iteration. The first avengers showed Loki at every step doing his job, explaining his motives giving him enough screen time and making him the lovable dirt bag we wanted but this movie has less than half of what the movie needs to offer. , Or at least half of what it's previous movie offered. It is a fun movie, and must be watched in theater, but let me warn you, if you are a big avengers fan, like I am, this movie will grow on you, in a bad sense.",6
Age of Ultron Keeps the Pressure On,5 May 2015,"The steamrolling new cinematic world of Marvel movies continues with round two of the Avengers storyline, Avengers: Age of Ultron. With Joss Whedon once again behind the camera and behind the pen, the bar was set pretty high, but he met expectations in more ways than one.

Avengers: Age of Ultron deals with the central fear of Tony Stark, who has seen through the looking glass into the universe beyond and knows what's out there. No known power on Earth can stop what's coming, even his new team of superheroes, so Stark decides to build an artificial weapon strong enough to defend the planet for them. Not the most unique of ideas, but anytime someone builds artificial intelligence, it inevitably turns against them.

The Avengers must come together quickly to fix Stark's mistake, while dealing with the introduction of two new mutants, Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch, who have a deep seated hatred for Stark and his history of weapons manufacturing.

Going into this film, it is impossible to truly measure the cultural and economic weight it was under. The first film grossed over $1.5 billion dollars, which because of other massive tentpole successes, $1 billion dollars is slowly becoming the threshold to pass in order to be called a ""huge win"" for the studio.

On top of that, The Avengers created the new algorithm for bringing a number of unique comic book hero movies together into one grand franchise. This is already being repeated by other studios (especially Warner Brothers and DC Comics) and it will continue to be the pattern for the foreseeable future. Marvel figured out the key and it unlocked the movie universe for decades to come.

The performances in Age of Ultron were mostly up to my expectations. Robert Downey Jr. continues to bring depth and failings to Iron Man, while Mark Ruffalo rages forward as the best actor to ever play the Hulk (sorry, Bill Bixby.) Chris Hemsworth and Chris Evans hold up their end of the bargain as Thor and Captain America, respectively. No one falls behind, even with the cameos of Don Cheadle as War Machine, Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury, and Anthony Mackie as The Falcon.

Yet, to me the standouts in relation to the returning cast have to go to Scarlett Johansson (as Black Widow) and Jeremy Renner (as Hawkeye.) Johansson continues to peel back the layers of Black Widow's early childhood trauma and the effects of her brutal training as one of the world's best assassins. Renner stands alone in this movie as the emotional glue, the magnet that holds together the theme in this chapter, which is family.

Newcomers Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen move far beyond their brief cameo in Captain America: Winter Soldier as the dangerous Russian twins, Quicksilver and Scarlett Witch. Taylor-Johnson gets to play both the smoldering anger of a child who's seen too much horror and the protective older brother who would do anything to protect surviving member of his family. Olsen also has similar traits, but her power burns much stronger and with it also comes her frailty in how to use and control it. She's not yet a soldier when the film begins, but the events that unfold force her to make that choice.

James Spader provides the sinister voice and machine madness of Ultron. Once again a massively popular household name, Spader brings much of the same arrogance of his lead character in the hit TV show, The Blacklist, but here it's as if that character loses his cool. Insanely brilliant, insanely powerful, and just plain insane.

Balancing him out is the final character premier in the film, Vision, played beautifully by Paul Bettany. I was worried because Vision is a hard character to make emotionally compelling since he is almost purely logical and they could have easily fallen into the same trap as The Watchmen and the character of Dr. Manhattan. Yet, Bettany showed once again why he is one of the best in his generation and why Marvel does not skimp on effort or money to get the most talented people for the part. He overlays his logic with love, his power with purpose, and his intensity with intelligence. This is a character I am going to really enjoy watching grow in the coming films.

Another impressively well written, structured and acted film from the Marvel universe, Avengers: Age of Ultron will not disappoint new fans, old fans, or go down in film history as ""the weak part of the franchise.""",9
As a huge fan of the first film: This movie suffers from many issues,1 May 2015,,6
"Aan""EPIC"" follow up to a great film of 2012.",24 April 2015,,9
Wonderful.,25 April 2015,"No, i did not see that coming. I'll be honest, i never cared much for the Marvel films. In fact, to me, The Avengers was a huge disappointment. I hated it. But this movie was everything i had hoped for. Its large, and to me the first Avengers looked so...Dull. Boring. But this one had a lot more color. And the characters really blossomed here. In the first film everyone was just sorta there, but here it just feels better. The action was more intense. And i know that story wise this film resembled the first one a lot, but i didn't mind. This film was the first one done right. And then we have the new characters. Scarlet Witch with her witch-esque powers added an interesting dynamic. But my favorite part of the movie has to be Quicksilver. Was the accent cheap? Yes. Was the humor slightly childish? Yes. Did i love every minute of it? YES! I cant help it, but i loved Quicksilver. And then we have Ultron. He took my expectations, laughed at them and exceeded them on every level. He was funny, charismatic and a much more enjoyable villain than teenage rebel Loki. The film was all around in enjoyable. I would have given it an 8 if...If not...:( All of you who saw it-You know what it is.",7
"With myriad of stars and visual spectacle, Avengers: Age of Ultron is a pinnacle of excellence",22 April 2015,"Pick a single name from the cast list, and chances are that name is worthy of leading a movie on their own. Having so many talented actors reprising their roles and few a new additions to the assemble, the movie has no shortage of star power. Action is exhilarating, all forms of heroes and foes blasting colorful beams, throwing acrobatic punches and aerial acrobat. This film is as big as one would hope, and more.

After a series of burdening battles, Tony Stark would try to use the power Avengers find to do some good, but his good intention doesn't produce equally good result. The premise is accessible, it doesn't try to overcomplicated thing, though what the film does best is how every character seems fitting in grand scheme of things. These strong individuals all have their own flaws and doubts, John Sheldon as director displays their struggles very aptly.

Regardless of the superhuman attributes they possess, their problems and fears are identifiable to audiences. Script is well written, just as the dramatic plot moves smoothly, the humor is spot-on too. They all exchange banters and quips in expense of each other, even the bad puns manage to pry some smiles. Balancing between the gradually bleak premise and the rich characters' ordeals are done gracefully. There is no weak spot here, as everyone performs amazingly and everyone in audience would likely find something, someone they can relate with.

Action is a hybrid between CG and choreography. Visual is astoundingly impressive. Fast and relentless, the mayhem is still delicately constrained for audience's viewing pleasure, so you'd know who is involved at the mauling on a particular scene. There are even a few snappy continuous shots for good measures. It is as grand as advertised, and better yet the dashing action sequences are shared harmoniously between the fancy characters.

Avengers: Age of Ultron is an explosion made from collision of stars and spectacular graphic, and with such a blast it is poised to be the biggest explosion of the year.",9
"Enjoyable, but...",10 May 2015,"First of all, I am a huge fan of Marvel since I was a little boy and I've been collecting their comics ever since. I was expecting a movie that would take the super hero genre to a next level. A movie that would take things more seriously with an impressive plot and well developed script. At least it was this kind of expectation the teasers and trailers were creating. Unfortunately, it wasn't what I was expecting.

There are several flaws within the movie. I'll try to shorten them as much as I can without spoiling anything. First thing that didn't please me was the one punch line jokes. They've put way too many jokes in this and none of them was satisfying as the ones in the first movie. It felt exaggerated. Secondly, the pace of things happening SO fast in consequence of bad writing. There were times that I had to go ""Wait a second. What about the other thing that just happened? Is that going to be explained?"". Some facts that would contribute to make the movie better were simply thrown in it without getting any kind of explanation. Third thing lacking was evolution. Despite the inclusion of new characters, Age of Ultron is a chapter that didn't accomplish much and did not move things forward. I left the movie confused and scratching my head wondering which fact of the second assembling could cause an impact on future events. I couldn't find much. And last but not least, the villain motivation for destroying humanity. I think everybody was expecting something intelligent, but no. It was just an old cliché.

Taking all these things aside, Age of Ultron guarantees itself as a great action-adventure movie. The team is in the best shape as they can be, delivering amazing action scenes and some awe moments. The new characters are also pretty cool and they had great chemistry with our old beloved ones.

I think 7 out of 10 is a fair score for this movie. Not great, but still enjoyable. Go with low expectations and you will have a more satisfying experience.",7
Vastly underrated in the MCU,1 March 2021,"I just watched this movie for the third time. I will say that this movie is packed so full of references, Easter eggs and set ups for future films, that it's difficult not to miss something.",9
Not that good,31 October 2017,"I knew when it was the ""action"" sequence and I was getting bored that I was in trouble.

To sum it up, each of the Avengers destroys dozens of the enemy. You're basically watching a duck hunt instead of something suspenseful. They try to hype up how dangerous it is, then each of the Avengers, no matter how powerful, suddenly becomes super powerful when it comes to destroying the enemy. The writers seemed to think that just having an action sequence was enough. That the people watching would just coo over seeing things destroyed. I wanted more.

*** Spoiler Ahead ***

Okay, then you have the one ""unexpected"" death. Which frankly was dumb. He was easily fast enough to move the targets out of the way and instead chooses to shield them with his body. I can only assume he was tired of living and wanted to commit suicide. It just made no sense.

Then you have the dramatic reactions to the death ... during the battle ... while civilians are still dying and you're still fighting ... for someone you basically just met. I realize this is common in movies. I just don't like it.

I don't want to make it sound like this is a 2 rating or something like that. The movie is still has the marvel heroes and it still creates a pretty good setting. It's just pretty pale when compared to the original, hence a 6.",6
"Same old, same old",25 April 2015,,4
A good one-time watch but expect less. 3/5,28 April 2015,"THE AVENGERS – AGE OF ULTRON

Apologies for the late review. I guess by now a lot of people must already have watched this mundane instalment from Marvel and must really have become confused as to what to make of the movie. So, let's roll.

I suppose the Marvel studio has really become filthy rich with its cinematic universe collections and since that ball is out of the park, they are busy weaving stories with no coherence whatsoever, to prepare for a grand finale.

No seriously! Someone has to say this. Because in my opinion, this movie was anything but close to its first instalment (notwithstanding the fact that Avengers universe is all about heroics and stunts and fantastic logics). Even judging by those standards, one feels alienated from the movie as it progresses. Well of course! Things are happening in the movie and no one knows why!

The first (known) absurdity was that despite the presence of Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver, they were not called by their names. And that was because of Marvel's rights issue with 20th Century Fox when they sold the rights of the characters of the mutants to the X-Men franchise. What's more absurd was that they were not even called 'Mutants'. They were 'Enhanced'.

Well even if you ignore that part, this character of Quicksilver doesn't even compare to the one we witnessed in X-Men -Days of Future Past. The humour of the character was just not apparent.

This brings me to the trailer of the movie. All we understood from the trailer was that a very dark portrayal of the story and the characters of Avengers is under-due; that we are going to witness a development which would do some soul searching, and show the grey shade the heroes would have to overcome. But alas! It all came down to nothing but just a little stint of manipulation by a future ally, and the dark visions of the heroes just seemed to be forced upon the viewers.

Not that one should complain about it, as the Avengers was always supposed to be a jolly franchise with great comic timings and humour. And that this movie does not disappoint in. The comic timings and funny punch-lines in the movie have still been retained the same as the first instalment. And that was the best part of the movie. Sure, we were not expecting it as we judged from the allegedly 'dark' trailer of the movie, but well this was the grease which kept the machine running. Extremely hilarious moments with a somewhat apathetic stance (obviously they are heroes!), tickles your senses and leaves you wanting more from that aspect of the movie. Full points to Avengers for that.

So it all comes down to the story. Remember the part where we learn about the 'infinity stones' in 'Guardians of the Galaxy' ? Well the story is basically trying to link that part to the Avengers, and apparently to converge the story lines of all the other movies into some Grand-finale episode (which would obviously feature 'Thanos'). Not to give away the story too much, I should only confess that all the hoolaboola in this movie was basically concentrated upon the ""things to come"" , and not ""things which are present"".

So what was all that hoolaboola ? ULTRON and its VISION! The only importance of Ultron in this movie (though it was portrayed to be very important as it was the brain-child of Tony Stark and the code in Loki's sceptre. Ah, just believe it!), was to be a mad program which tries to destroy the earth (once again), and it creates a ""Vision"" (another character) which is supposedly the saner part of ""Ultron"" and ultimately sides with the Avengers.

All of this is happening while the Avengers are just fighting amongst themselves. Not that it was not enjoyable, but please, concentrate on the villain already! Anyway, the largest part of the cake goes to the Iron Man Vs Hulk fight. That fight was nasty! If you are not sure whether to go watch this movie or not, just buy the tickets for this specific sequence!

All in all, the story is just straying around with too much speeches and unneeded philosophies (especially from Ultron) and there are literally too many people (from all other movies). The love-angle of Black Widow and #### was appreciable, along with a somewhat tragic end to one of the characters. But the climax was a bit anti- climactic as we expect a lot when it comes to a movie like Avengers, where the stakes are so high.

So all in all,

Humour – 5/5 Action – 3/5 Story – 1/5 Anticipation – 0/5

Verdict – A good one-time watch but expect less. 3/5

I am the Vitamin!,1 October 2015,"Don't expect me to write something as easy and liquid as this movie is. It is popcorn cinema at its best. The story? A bunch of co(s)mic based super heroes and super villains choose to fight about...something. a bucket of possibilities come into my mind, the world, justice, a city, a nation, whatever. Take what you like. The holy grail of shallow cinema. Well, if this would be everything, we would have been happy with Indiana Jones and all about it for the rest of our humble lives. But Indiana Jones isn't this interwoven into our modern world. We are obliged into value based thinking. Everything is of a certain value. Mixed with strong moral based and ethic principles, so we don't freak out. Our way of living is a modern tale, our ego is of value. And tales, as they were used through all times in history, do emphasize on a certain aspect. They offer a different view on real life circumstances, we cant easily describe else. And this is what The Avengers does. They are the perfect image of our principles, of our lives, how we are supposed to be in order to succeed in our lives, in business, in enterprises, in companies, in public places, at the grocery, at home, in our families, even on the toilet. Serve and protect. Love your next like your beloved brother. And you know this isn't easy, to keep the toilet clean with a brush after using it. So are the Avengers, they are always fighting on screen with uttermost force. And they do cause tremendous havoc. But this is just the image of what is unseen in our real life. Unseen because of the conservative and stodgy chair we took place in. And this movie is a tribute to this injustice. I am able to smile at my children when they play supercherios, marvel & crapman. They do honor me! All of them. And I know it. We are the Marvels. They are our inner heroes. Fighting every day for the good in this world, in all of us. A homage to you, as you would never dare to show to anyone, even not yourself. No need to see a shrink anymore. Watch the Avengers, watch all the Marvel Superheroes. You deserve it. I am the vitamin! 10 out of 10.",10
Sorry Ultron you won't be in hall of fame of the villains,1 May 2015,"The movie starts with the Avengers assaulting a remote HYDRA base in the fictional Eastern European republic of Sokovia where they encounter enhanced twins: the quick-footed Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and the mystical Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) but the real villains though is Ultron an Artificial Intelligence that Scarlet witch leads Stark to create.

When it comes to Ultron, It doesn't look much scarier or world threatening in any place, like in the previous movie Loki played the role of villain. Ultron doesn't live upto the expectation of a bad ass villain that you might expect.On the other hand twins were quite good to play villain and hero both.

The Avengers, bad guys and the new character are simply to much too tackle even for a director like Whedon. The Movie's sturdy machinery, the action sequence and extraneous story(Hawkeye's home) suck up most of the movies life. Otherwise it could have been way more better.

Being said all that its an overall entertaining movie with good action and some laughs in between. You will definitely enjoy it with your family more.",7
Avengers Are The Best Superhero Team,24 August 2018,"Now I have watched every single Avengers film I have come to a decision that they are so frickin' great. The story follows 2 twins named Wanda and Iforgot Maximoff being slaved by a group of Russians. Sooner or later the Avengers attack their base to collect Loki's scepter, and the twins decide they HATE the Avengers, as they believe Tony Stark bombed their house and killed their parents. Meanwhile Hulk and Tony are making a peace robot named Ultron which becomes evil. Ultron meets the twins and uses them for warriors. Soon enough the twins realize their mistake and join the Avengers. It is family friendly.",8
Just what I expect from a Marvel Movie,1 May 2015,"There seems to be a lot of people who say this movie was bland - I personally think they were expecting too much from the Marvel format. You should go to a Marvel movie knowing that it will contain the following ingredients:

1. Superheros who kick bad guy butt

2. Bad guys who make no strategic sense in their decisions even given their supposed super intelligence.

3. Lots of cheesy dialogue and jokes.

4. Enemy weapons of mass destruction that seem to take a long time to ""power up"" before destruction.

5. Cameos, tie-ins and links to other movies in the Marvel franchise.

I agree this is a tied formula but its great brain dead entertainment which is fun for the whole family. Action, well timed saves and cheesy jokes all round.",7
Much better than I was expecting,30 April 2015,"I feel that great deal of the criticism of the movie is undeserved. Sure it's not perfect, but what movie is. I just saw the movie and because of reading the forum posts on this site I expected it to be a disaster. It wasn't even close to that, I enjoyed it very much. Anyone who loved the other marvel universe films should have loved this one as they were no different in there style, it puzzles me why that seems not to be the case. Also the people who said that it didn't have a darker edge to it were not quite right, it was about as dark as you get in an action movie that has a lighter theme to it. Some said that the humour was out of place and there was to much of it. I was expected s cringe worthy, but the humour of the movie was neither overused or out of place nearly as much as it was claimed to be. So that was proved false for the most part as well.

This movie show the up and down of the characters very well and the character development was very good for an action movie, even for the new character that we were just introduced. It is very hard to balance the action, have a good story to tell and develop the characters at the same time. In the end it was a great action film that was on par with the other marvel films that were very big successes. I really hope that the overly critical response to the movie does not harm it's success at the box office.",10
Age of LOLtron,25 April 2015,"With the strength of the Winter Soldier, Marvel has outed itself as being capable of producing a film to compete with the Dark Knight. So the direction of the Avengers is a marker to how they see the war against the DCU panning out.

Essentially, Age of Ultron is a great piece of entertainment, but the threads of it's own destruction are built in. As the main artery for new characters, this film runs out of time to really introduce them. We get the one liners, the strong moments between the existing cast but in the background the mechanics of the plot cycle on with little explanation.

The casual breaking of cannon (no spoilers here) does not seem to be done to create anything stronger - instead all the new characters are somewhat malformed. Ultron has the humour of Stark, but the enemy doesn't really add anything new to deal with. As the entertainment explodes onto the screen, the films franchise implodes.",7
Exceeded my expectations in every way. The best superhero movie of all time!,24 April 2015,"Avengers: Age of Ultron continues with the story of the Avengers, who are Earth's mightiest heroes. The team consists of Tony Stark/Iron Man(Robert Downey Jr.), Thor(Chris Hemsworth), Bruce Banner/The Hulk(Mark Ruffalo), Steve Rogers/Captain America(Chris Evans), Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow(Scarlett Johansson) & Clint Barton/Hawkeye(Jeremy Renner). After the events of The Avengers(2012), Iron Man 3(2013), Thor: The Dark World(2013) & Captain America: The Winter Soldier(2014), the Avengers are hot on the trail of Loki's scepter which is in the hands of HYDRA. Due to all the attacks on Earth in recent times, Tony Stark believes that the world needs additional protection, other than the Avengers. He convinces Dr. Bruce Banner to help him build Ultron(James Spader), a sentient robot that can protect the Earth & help the Avengers to stop any global threat. However, things don't quite go as planned. Ultron has a warped perception of the world & the Avengers. He wants all the Avengers extinct & has diabolical plans for the Earth. Now, it is up to the Avengers to stop Ultron before it's too late. However, it won't be easy as Ultron has the help of twins with incredible powers. They are Pietro Maximoff/Quicksilver(Aaron Taylor-Johnson) who has the power of super speed & Wanda Maximoff/Scarlet Witch(Elizabeth Olsen) who has the power of telekinesis & mind control.

Avengers: Age of Ultron is an incredibly epic film! It surpasses its predecessor in every way possible! My expectations for this movie were through the roof. I kept thinking to myself, there's no way that it can surpass the highest grossing superhero movie of all time. I was wrong. Joss Whedon has outdone himself. He has truly made a bigger & better film. Sure, the formula is the same as the first movie but, everything is ten times better. Besides, only the basic idea remains the same. The climax of the movie is significantly different. The camaraderie among the Avengers has increased. There are plenty of memorable scenes with all of them together. Though this film is darker, the humor that all the Marvel movies are known for, is intact. There are plenty of witty one-liners that will make you guffaw from time to time. Plus, if you enjoyed the squabbling among the various Avengers in the first film, don't fret. There's plenty of that, this time around too. I loved the fact that our heroes travel the globe & are not just stuck in New York where almost all superhero movies take place. The special effects are otherworldly. Each action set-piece is more fantastic & thrilling than the last. Two of my most favorite sequences are the Hulk vs. the Hulkbuster showdown & the climax of the movie. The 3D is eye-popping & has been put to good use throughout the film. This movie wouldn't be half as incredible without the superb performances from the stellar cast. Robert Downey Jr. is spectacular as Tony Stark/Iron Man. After so many portrayals of this character, Downey Jr.'s performance seems effortless. Chris Hemsworth is awesome as Thor. Hemsworth balances the God of Thunder's wit & seriousness with ease. Mark Ruffalo is brilliant as Bruce Banner/The Hulk. Ruffalo's killing it as both the mild mannered scientist & the 'other guy'. The motion capture for the Hulk is extremely realistic. Chris Evans is outstanding as Steve Rogers/Captain America. Evans keeps getting better & better with each portrayal of America's first superhero. Scarlett Johansson is amazing as Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow. Johansson portrays a more vulnerable Nat, this time around. Jeremy Renner is great as Clint Barton/Hawkeye. I loved that Renner's character is given more importance in this sequel. Aaron Taylor-Johnson & Elizabeth Olsen are super as Pietro Maximoff/Quicksilver & Wanda Maximoff/Scarlet Witch. The Maximoff twins are a welcome addition to the Avengers universe. Paul Bettany is excellent & unrecognizable as Jarvis/Vision. James Spader is the perfect combination of intimidating, powerful, terrifying & funny as Ultron. All the ingredients that make the ideal villain. Spader's deep baritone & trademark drawl are perfect for the voice of Ultron. Cobie Smulders is impressive as Maria Hill. Samuel L. Jackson is perfect as Nick Fury. Many key players in the Marvel Cinematic Universe have cameos. They are good too. Joss Whedon & the entire cast & crew of Avengers: Age of Ultron, take a bow. Avengers: Age of Ultron is a masterpiece. Go for it now!",10
A solid day at the cinema.,6 May 2015,"I never did watch the first Avengers. I had low expectations for this flick as I am not a huge fan of the super hero genre in general, but I really did enjoy this movie. It has solid action and a decent enough story. Some reviewers say that the dialogue is cliché. I can see that it some respects, but it is mostly a good tone. I found myself smiling during the entire Thor hammer thing. It was pretty entertaining. My main gripe with the film may be that it is littered with irrelevant lines that are attempts at humor. It is formulaic and constant and pretty annoying during a series action sequence.

Overall the movie is a 7. It is not something I see as memorable or earth shattering, but it is a fun night at the movies.",7
A lackluster superhero flick,25 July 2016,"This movie takes a long time to gain any steam, with a lot of all talk and no action in the first half of the movie. There is also little suspense and intrigue - just the superheroes pondering and conjuring their next mission, with Tony Stark and Bruce Banner creating a project called Ultron to act as a peacekeeping program serving as the movie's backdrop.

The Ultron project goes horribly wrong and the machine takes a mind of its own, threatening to rid the world of humans in attempts to ""save the world"" - something we've heard before.

We get to see action slowly trickle in during the second half of the movie slowly - lots of crazy CGI action during the rumbling climax. This film's plot sets the story for the next film, Captain America: Civil War, in motion. However, I thought this film overall lacked the entertainment value due to its extremely slow plot and lackluster story.

Grade D",4
like most of it but final battle gets a little boring,2 January 2016,,7
Brilliant sequel,1 May 2015,"After the release of the Avengers in 2012, I excitedly waited the release of its sequel. It set the bar very high. Age of Ultron did not disappoint me at all. I enjoyed every moment of it. I went to see the Avengers sequel at a 7:00 pm IMAX 3-D showing a day early.

In Age of Ultron, the Avengers finally turned into a team that works well together. They have been tracked down HYDRA facilities after the fall of SHIELD as shown in Captain America-Winter Soldier. In one mission, they run into Baron Von Strucker and the Maximoff twins (Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch). After finding Loki's scepter from the first Avengers movie, Tony Stark and Bruce Banner use it to create the artificial intelligence, Ultron. Like in other movies with AI, Ultron goes rogue.

Ultron's plan causes him to butt heads with the Avengers. It also leads up to the creations of the Vision. It's great how the Vision and Ultron have contrasting views of the world and the human race. The movie does a great job of keeping the audience's attention. It has a pretty good story. Also, Age of Ultron has a lot of funny moments that everyone will like.

The movie, like the first Avengers movie, has an amazing cast that works well with each other. I liked the newcomers in the movie as well. The actors who played Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch were great in their respective roles. The best part of the movie is James Spader. He steals the show every time he shows up as Ultron. By the end of the movie, everyone was clapping. Age of Ultron is worth seeing and a great sequel to the first Avengers movie.",9
I hoped more balanced thrill not bits & pieces of every emotion,5 May 2015,"well after seeing the trailer i thought this movie must be something which will be more thrilling than the first one or even better than terminator .but i guess you have to remember its easy to make the top ranked trailer but when it comes to joining the pieces together then the real director's,script writers magic happens.

This movie is really bits & pieces .Here & there some action then some really annoyingly slow almost silent long family drama then starts action again after that comes the sad part (its like a machine deciding happy,fight fight ,happy ,family ,cry ,sad sad ).I actually laughed in the sad part when the sad, really common(no original) music began because felt at that time that emotion was like force feeding sadness in short time(like some one is in hurry to go to toilet after that ) .

Most boring part was really bad dialogue(school kid like),too much humanizing super heroes .come on these are super heroes they shouldn't be humanize with silly romantic ,family talk,kiddie personality .In a action sequence too much slow down with character's own problems really painful to watch .its like in a war you are dealing with some whining babies",7
Get ready folks.You are going to watch the best superhero movie till date,25 April 2015,"Director has been excellent in explaining the story and I also liked the way he used each and every character very effectively.Robert Downey Jr. as Tony stark once again proved that no hero could replace him as Iron Man.3 more new avengers(Vision,Scarlet witch and Quicksilver) have been added which made me feel very excited about the movie and it really didn't disappoint my expectations.In this movie you can mainly observe comedy,tragedy,action,romance and everything.Chris Evans as Captain America has once again proved that he's the worthy of it.Thor has been really excellent when compared to his previous movies.The other three avengers Hulk,Hawk-Eye and Black Widow have been outstanding in this movie.Last but not least Ultron.His views about the world and his plans of destruction makes him one the most powerful villains marvel has ever made.Finally, Avengers:Age of Ultron has exceeded my expectations and I felt it was far better than the previous movie(Avengers).Great job done by the whole crew.Hatsoff to all the Avengers team.",10
"plot lacks surprises , otherwise fine",4 June 2015,"The trailers that this movie published could have shown a bit less .. then the movie would have been even more interesting .... hulk suit of iron man shown in the trailers made it even worse ... next time Marvel comics should keep in mind that revealing all the cards never pays off .. already people know that its an action movie , now if you reveal even the surprises inside the action then makes no sense. But the hawk eye revelation was worth watching . And some hint of the upcoming movie CIVIL WAR made it even more interesting. Many new characters have been added and what I feel is good for marvel world as things were becoming a bit monotonous. the characters have created new dimensions that will actually make the upcoming marvel movies even more interesting.",7
It was great and packed with actions,5 May 2015,"i love the humors in this avengers sequel. THE VISION IS JUST INSANE! AMAZING! so hyped and pumped about the vision and they didn't disappoint me. love this movie. but i just don't know how the members are reunite though. didn't feel like 2 hours, it was just one of the best movies i've seen and i can't compare it to the first because they both are amazing. great job Joss, i really had a great time watching this film. ULTRON WAS SO BADASS man, just can't get enough of him. i like both versions of quicksilver this one and the dofp one. James Spader did a really great job. the last scene gives me chill. HULKBUSTER FIGHT DAMN THAT WAS HOT AS HELL. just a great movie to watch and yeah thats it",10
"A lazy compilation of half baked ideas put together, but still... lots of fun!",6 May 2015,,7
Perfect Movie,30 April 2015,"Movie was perfect, was fun and high action packed if u expect an Oh my god amazing drama plot,look somewhere else because this movie is pure action, not dark stories from Dc ,good job Marvel, Amazing Joss Whedon. Let the Dc fan boys keep complaining. The cast felt so perfect for this movie, and the amount of some laugh scenes matched perfectly for every moment it took to made its purpose. Ultron was a better enemy than Loki in many ways, and no matter how much u have seen in trailers it doesn't compare with the amount of action and destruction you will finally see in the movie. Every scene and every second of it was fun and well designed, not only cgi but for the acting of the cast , special mention to Scarllet Johanson , she took over the Black Widow character so perfectly and her accent was nice.",8
The End of an Age,11 May 2015,"It seems incredible to think that super-hero films might crash and burn the same way that historic/religious epics did half a century ago. After all, they have much more appeal for children than did those earlier movies, and every few years the market for a children's film is renewed. But seeing Avengers: Age of Ultron, one can see the end coming. Joss Whedon's writing is clever, but not as strong as what Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely have done with the Captain America films, although to cut Whedon some slack, the nature of the Avengers forces the writer to work with a huge and unwieldy cast; there aren't many writers who could have made Age of Ultron as good as it is.

Still, the overall feeling is that there's simultaneously too much of everything, and not enough of anything. Watching Avengers: Age of Ultron in a cinema with multi-channel sound turned up just a bit too high is a special kind of sensory overload, like those sixties rock concerts where the audience got stoned because that was the only way they could stand the volume. The multiple digital effects are at once dazzling and numbing; they are like a rich man's funeral where the huge floral arrangements are meant to confirm that the deceased was beloved, but only confirm that he was rich.

The result is that it's the real things that make us stop and say ""hey there"": that the crowds fleeing the Hulk's rampage are predominantly black (it is, after all, Johannesburg, but seems like a brilliant innovation because we are so used to seeing crowds of white people, and Asians, in blockbusters and kaiju films); that after years of hearing Paul Bettany as Jarvis, we actually get to see him, looking and sounding great; and that when all the dust has settled and the crisis is over, Tony Stark summons that most mundane of sci-fi devices (soon to be science fact): a driverless car. Although spectacles come and go, at the core of great films are real things. In Age of Ultron, the real things remain at the periphery, when they should be at the core.

PS: the incredibly skewed gender and racial politics of superhero films are also dating them shamefully. At least in Age of Ultron, a few women occasionally get to do something. But the black characters played by Don Cheadle (a bit of a fifth wheel, even in the Iron Man films), Anthony Mackie (after Captain America: The Winter Soldier, we want to see more of the Falcon and the actor who plays him, not just a glimpse) and Samuel L. Jackson (who doesn't do much in any of these films except once again, the excellent Winter Soldier) are hastily shuffled through the plot, soon dispensed with to make way for the white heroes. Perhaps mass audiences want super-heroes; but how long are they going to put up with this comic book white-guys-only world?",6
The director couldn't catch the achievement of the first,20 March 2016,"The Avengers Age of Ultron starts out with a soulless and pointless action sequence and the rest of the movie is not much different than this part. Since we don't know our heroes fight for who and why, we don't get excited for the adventure that our heroes have. Then, somehow, the cinematography is lifeless, the technical craftsmanship accomplishment is boring. Everything is too mechanic here. The villain of the movie is an artificial intelligence, again ""mechanic"". Everything about this villain is so cliché from his words to his evil plans to destroy the world, humanity, whatever. In the first movie, almost everything was perfect. This second installment is lack of heart and soul and an exciting adventure. The movie was like an empty roller coaster ride. The action and the fight scenes are uninspiring, lifeless. Everything happens just so quickly and it is overblown. Another thing the movie was lack of is the tension or clash between the allies. What makes the first movie spectacular was the sweet conflicts among the heroes. Returning to Ultron, it was not intimidating, not hilarious like Loki, honestly, it is just a machine! (Terminator fans, please don't be offended, this is a different case) In contrast with the promises by the director, this is not a darker movie. This is a boring action film. For example, adding romance into a movie doesn't make it deeper or sophisticated. Action is soulless and completely forgettable here except for two scenes. The first and the best is Hulk vs. Hulbuster scene which was fairly done. I have seen it dozens of times. The second one is the highway chase with Captain America and Black Widow, but it was like a copy of The Matrix Reloaded and nothing new. From the beginning, I don't like the appearance or the manners of this new Hulk (the first is favorite), but Hulk is OK here. The second half of the movie focuses on destruction like Man of Steel in a bad way. Do you want to hear Iron Man's witty comments? Thor's majesty? Captain America's work discipline? Hulk's anger? None of them is here. Loki? I miss him. Unfortunately, Quicksilver loses the game from the first minute, because we had seen a brilliant Quicksilver before. Scarlett Witch bewitched me, but I just couldn't get warm to her. I hope I will start to love her in future installments. Vision was completely unnecessary. Hulk is not like a gorilla or a fun mascot here which is good, but he is used like a pawn in this movie. Finally, Age of Ultron is sometimes dreadful, sometimes cheesy, sometimes dull, sometimes pretentious and mostly soulless sequel. I am very happy that the next adventures are going to be directed by Russo Brothers who gave us terrific ""The Winter Soldier"".",1
"Great effects, mangled story",28 April 2015,"Another great Avengers film, but with a story that is both lacking in depth and reasoning, and a way it is told.

We have seen some very successful Marvel films, and all of these had a compelling story which is WELL told. Not so, unfortunately, with this title. Without going into too much detail in order not to spill the spoilers, lets mention:

a) AI goes bad for no reason, but ""just for the heck of it"". Argumentation on pair with ""The madness just happens"" ?

b) No causal reasoning (valid explanatory path) as to WHY it wants to destroy Stark, Avengers and/or the World. Kiddie play level.

c) Way too many Avenger and related characters, so that the main chars get lost from time to time and you ask yourself: ""What and where are they doing at this critical moment?"". No char gets therefore to build his/her role.

One understands the need to have pauses in between dynamic action. But it is a STORY that makes or breaks a film.. In between the Whedon ideas and the way the film is cut, the viewer is left without a meaningful plot.",7
Avengers Assemble!,9 May 2015,"This movie is awesome! Please complete your life and go see it! It had me from beginning to end! Never underestimate the power of marvel movies! I think that marvel always produces a great action movie that could satisfy everyone. The action is so so good, words can't even describe it! It never seizes to amaze me how good of a movie marvel produces. I have been a marvel fan since before I could walk thanks to my father and I have not been disappointed by one of their movies yet.Avengers definitely is the best movie of the year so far next to furious 7. I absolutely love how they have this franchise going. If you do not like superhero movies unlike myself I recommend you go see this movie, you might just change your mind.",10

"Marvel fails to disappoint a second time, but how long can they keep it up?",1 May 2015,"After seeing Avengers 2: Age of Ultron, I discovered a trick of the Marvel franchise: make as many fights happen in the sky as possible in order to increase the stakes of that fight. It's the looming fall that makes every fight on a floating city more dramatic, and it's in many ways similar to the looming fall that superhero movies as a whole are facing for the near future as they find their peak and descend as a passing trend.

I have to admit that going into this movie I was 80% expecting it to disappoint, probably due to a personal burnout that is likely a foreshadowing of a collective burnout for the genre in the years to come (if it hasn't started to peter out already). I predict the late 2010s to be the waning years of superhero movies, and the solidified polarization in big budget blockbusters and small art-house/indie films made for those willing to seek them out.

Avengers 2: Age of Ultron falls on the farthest opposite end from anything art-house, however, and it's likely one of the best of that ilk.

The movie delivers on surprises, tense moments, loss, and laughs. In many ways, it's an almost identical experience to the last one, which begs the question of where we go from here. Do the movies keep creating new characters and digging deeper into plot lines with obscure references from the early days of the franchise? Do we eventually lose our senior class and get a whole new set of characters (and the actors that play them) that probably want to move on and diversify their careers?

I get that feeling watching this movie, though I have to tip my hat to Marvel Studios for keeping the spirit alive and doing about the best the could with these comic book characters. Really, a cultural mythology like this couldn't ask for a better revival than what the Marvel universe has given it.

For those who loved the first one, you'll like this one just as much or slightly less. They spent less time on explaining some of the events of the movie, possibly to its detriment. If you love explanations of the magic stones and the technology of Tony Stark and Bruce Banner, then you'll be disappointed because they do a lot that isn't explained well in the movie.

Characters we love return, and it was tastefully done, avoiding the temptation to cater to the super fans and start name-dropping more obscure heroes to get cheap wows from the audience.

For Catholics and religious folks in general, there's a presence of spirituality in the movie that falls in line with the growing suspicion toward religion in general we're finding in movies of this size. This is seen in Ultron using the most explicitly religious language, ""On this rock I will build my church"" and ""Have you come to confess your sins?"" Yes, the villain utters those lines in the movie, showing himself to be a false Christ figure, with other allusions to the End Times and the tragic ending of the human race peppered throughout the movie. There's a borrowing from (conscious or not) religion in these movies because the language is both potent and familiar though it seems films have turned more suspicious toward religious figures, opting for a broader (and often far more bland) expression of a nebulous goodness and spirituality.

I admire the Thor character and his story most for his nod to the mystery of another world that has influence on our own. Thor's addition to the Avengers story acknowledges a spiritual dimension in the world, even if it doesn't fall directly in line with Judeo- Christian traditions. He holds sway over the rest of the Avengers as a god and the only god on the team, and stands out as an entity that emanates the divine though in a more pagan sense. This is best seen in a comical part of the movie where the entire team tries to lift his hammer, and the bickering that ensues when they can't they argue over how the mechanism works. Thor seems most comfortable leaving it as a test of worthiness, saying it's something beyond us to manipulate or understand (though I'm sure it's explained in his comic book storyline).

Also notable is how the movie conveys a global feel, adding to my thesis that movies will either become big big blockbusters made for global audiences (with sometimes heavy handed pandering to that global audience), or become culturally esoteric art-house films. Knowing that Chinese audiences are the biggest source of money for these movies outside of the US, the film puts a few Chinese characters into the movie speaking the language and having a prominent role. Later, we're taken to Africa where another fight breaks out, and finally to somewhere in Eastern Europe, and by the end we're not sure exactly where we are in the world.

In the handful of reviews I skimmed for Avengers 2, I saw one insight from a review that aptly pointed out the future for the movie industry. It was summed up in two similar though very different recent releases. ""Ex Machina"" came out a few weeks ago and features a set of four actors on a single location making a story about an artificially intelligent machine made by a genius. In many ways, it's another take on Age of Ultron though it couldn't be any more different. The movie is powerful, thoughtful and moving though in ways Avengers 2 isn't nor would ever attempt to be (and wisely so). Basically one is a movie and the other is a film, assuming the tone that goes with each of those labels.

That difference is the near future of film, and I don't find it as grim as many portend it to be.",8
Tooo much characters and an average Villain,6 May 2015,"What makes a good superhero movie is a monster villain....Good superhero movies are always judged by their super villains like joker in batman, Aldrich Killian in iron man 3 and sooo on....what makes avenger an average movie is its average villain...suffice to say that as the traditional MARVEL franchise movies are its from the same line...a brainless plot and action action everywhere even if its needed or its not...Avengers: Age of ultron certainly has its moments like an epic fight between the Hulk and the Iron Man...but thats much less compared to the original movie plus there are too much characters and you cant give them ample space on the screen in 2hrs 21min...On the bright side it has quite a few witty moments,clever dialogues and top of the line aciton...verdict is if you are an avenger fan go see it but don't compare it with avengers first movie coz its different in a way as transformers is from its sequels...",7
The most average of all the Avenger films,26 April 2023,"Avengers: Age of Ultron was a huge deal when it came out, because it was the next step for what the future of the MCU holds. After the fall of S. H. I. E. L. D. and classified documents are released to the world, the Avengers reunite once more to take down a Hydra base and retrieve Loki's scepter. When Tony Stark and Bruce Banner decide to use the scepters energy to launch the Ultron program that would become a peacemaker for the world that would put a end to anymore outside threats, it's discovered that Ultron has a mind of his own that's set on human extinction and it's up to the Avengers to put a end to Ultron's terror while battling demons of their own. What I love the most about this Avengers film, is that we get that actual Avengers vibe and moments throughout the film of them just being together bonding instead of them just battling against Ultron. Robert Downey Jr is fantastic as always as Tony Stark/Iron Man. Chris Hemsworth is magnificent as Thor. Chris Evans is great as Steve Rogers/Captain America. Mark Ruffalo brings his A game as Bruce Banner/Hulk in this film. Scarlett Johansson is stunning as Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow. Jeremy Renner is brilliant as always as Clint Barton/Hawkeye. The newcomers Aaron-Taylor Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen as Pietro and Wanda Maximoff were my favorite of the new cast members of the whole film and helped make the film as great as it is. James Spader as Ultron himself I thought was a great casting choice to portray the character. My only problem I really have is not with him or his portrayal, but in all the promotions for this film made him out to be more menacing than he actually ended up being, but other than that, he was a good villain. The character I was most glad to see come to the MCU in this film is Paul Bettany's J. A. R. V. I. S./Vision. After being in the MCU as the voice J. A. R. V. I. S. since Iron Man (2008), it was really great to see him actually come to the big screen and into the MCU. Other cast member such as Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury, Anthony Mackie's Falcon, Don Cheadle's Rhodey/War Machine, and Cobie Smulders Maria Hill were also great additions to the film although I felt each character was definitely underused a bit. I loved the chemistry between Bruce Banner/Hulk and Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow throughout the film and I really wished we would of gotten more of them together. I was also glad to get to know a little more about Clint Barton/Hawkeye too. The sibling relationship between Pietro and Wanda Maximoff was great, but I felt they didn't show as much as they could of. Overall, Avengers: Age of Ultron is thrilling, fun, visually stunning, and action packed from beginning to end while also looking forward for what's to come to the MCU. Rating 8/10.",8
Meh.,11 May 2015,"As noted elsewhere, Age of Ultron was underwhelming. I was expecting something great, awesome, impressive... And even though the special effects were top notch, the story was not.

Besides, the trailers show about half of the best moments of the movie. There were a bunch of spoilers for me. I could tell what was coming next. If you've seen the trailers, you pretty much can guess what's going to happen next.

Maybe the main problem was that there were too many times when I felt like the writers were trying to force me to care something for the characters. To connect. And I just didn't. They could have removed a big chunk of scenes and the movie would not have suffered for it.",7
The Best!!,4 August 2021,"Another great superheroes action movie! When i watched this, i was amazed!!",8
Certainly better than 1st part,25 April 2015,"AVENGERS : AGE OF ULTRON REVIEW- Just finished watching Avengers Age of Ultron.we know its marvel's money making series so we don't expect quality or class from these kind of films. We expect some eye catching action,stunts,vfx etc. and film fulfills all these needs. Here we gets a perfect sequel. We see more action,more destruction,much stronger villain in case of visuals . Story seems little bit similar to bollywood flick Ra.one but we know its Hollywood which never let us down. Awesome VFX,brilliant action sequences,eye catching 3D work and fairly good story makes this film a must watch. All actors have done a great job as they did in their previous films. Story is not that much great but screenplay is really better what we look for. Director made it pretty good to watch and makes sure we don't get bored. It keeps us to the edge of our seats. But the technical team has won the battle here they have done an excellent job here to make this sequel better than its 1st part. If you are looking for another action movie from marvel then you can't afford to miss this one. Probably this sequel is updated version of its prequel,and certainly much better as well. So go and watch it to experience some awesome visual effects. Kudos to the entire team for making a better sequel than our expectations. Best movie of Marvel till date.",7
Same old same old,7 August 2015,"I could write a lengthy review about how dull this movie is, how the fact that it is so overcrowded with minor characters that none of the Avengers gets a proper treatment, how thin and ridiculous the script is, how bad the dialogs and jokes are, but in the end it wouldn't make a difference, because no matter how bad this umpteenth Marvel movie is, people will still see it, if only for the special effects. Marvel's universe is an endless money making machine so they will continue shoving their mediocre movies down our throats as long as they keep earning billions from it! To me, this movie could be summed up in 3 letters : SOB - same old bullshit. 5/10",5
"Extremely Forgettable, Vacuous, and Formulaic",4 May 2015,,7
Why all the hate?,13 June 2018,"When I saw this movie for the first time, I liked it but I wouldn't have given it a 10. After watching it a few more times, it has become one of my favorites. They bring all the characters together, plus a few new comers, and pit them against a pretty decent villain. I'm assuming that's one of the reasons the movie is getting some hate but I think he plays a good enough villain for not having any set up prior to this movie and requires the need to bring the whole MCU together to fight this great threat.",10
Not what I wanted it to be,4 May 2015,"Well... This movie has been hyped ever since the end of the first one and that is probably why it didn't live up to it. To start off, I want to state that I am a huge fan of the marvel universe and comics themselves. That being said, this movie as a marvel movie, did not deliver even more so. If you don't read the comics and know nothing besides what has been in the other movies, then this is a much better movie. However, as a marvel movie, one that has had amazing movies surpass the last and fantastic sequels thus far, Avengers fell short.

All previous movies in the marvel universe had stories to tell (not to mention loads of easter eggs) this movie not so much. It had SOME easter eggs but only the superfan would really notice. As for the story, the main villain is Ultron, who in my opinion, did NOT seem threatening. The point of the movie is to save the world right? Ultron seemed much more like a comic relief than a villain. He didn't do anything to make me think the world even was in peril! His lackies did most of the 'bad' stuff.

The main thing that worked against the movie however was that it wasn't an Avengers movie! It was all a big 'look what's coming next' movie. This movie spent more time prepping everyone for Thor 3, Captain America 3, the infinity war movies, Black Panther... it took a while for it to really get kicked off as its own movie.

Now that the things I thought were bad are out of the way, it had many good things to it. For one, it's LOADED with awesome action sequences with so many stars! With emphasis on 'so many'... I think they did a great job distributing an equal amount of screen time to all those actors. What else was good? ...that's about it. Action, big names, and the Marvel name. This was a super anticipated movie and so much hype wasn't met. Hopefully, the upcoming movies will be better than this sequel.",7
The Lull in the Avengers Series,13 February 2023,"With it's massively successful predecessor and two box office smashing successors, Age of Ultron appears weaker upon reflection compared to its cinematic siblings. That does not, however, make this a bad movie. This movie has a lot to it that's worth seeing. It gives us more time to appreciate the original six Avengers all working together before Civil War broke them apart and Infinity war changed everything. We got to see Captain America and Iron Man's rivalry grow, Black Widow and Hulk grow closer, and Hawkeye gets a bit more depth in this movie. Thor, however, feels a bit left out of the relevancy loop in this one, but considering his pivotal role in the subsequent Avengers movies, we can understand that movies don't always have time for every character to get the spotlight. Plus, we got new additions in the form of Wanda Maximoff, Vision, Quicksilver. Additionally, Ultron appears. Now that we have seen Ultron's potential in the MCU canon animated series What If...?, Ultron feels somewhat weak by comparison. However, he does his job well in this movie of being a computer who sees the inverse correlation between ""peace in our time"" and humanity, and makes sure the stakes are high. Pun intended. Perhaps Ultron could have benefitted from a little more development, but not every movie can be perfect.

Overall, this movie is a good MCU entry, but in retrospective, didn't hold up to the other Avengers movies, but considering how high that bar is, this should not dissuade you from watching this film, as it's pivotal to the MCU, bringing in very significant new characters and revealing an Infinity Stone to the world. Definitely worth watching.",8
"Not as good as the first film, but still a solid action movie",23 April 2015,"There's no way that this lives up to the first film - it doesn't have the fun factor nor the bright, optimistic feel of a team movie. Despite that, the general job of a sequel is to be a bit darker, and this does that very well, whilst there's still great action all the way through, and a pretty epic villain that makes it all very exciting too.

Let's just start with why this isn't as good as the first Avengers movie. There, you had the reluctant union of all of your favourite heroes, but it unfolds in a very optimistic way, as they all do unite and fight together despite their differences, whereas this film shows it all in a bit more of a staggered way. Sure, the Avengers are still together, but it doesn't feel as if there's that real camaraderie between them that made the first film so bright.

What's more is that this follow-up simply just isn't as fun as the first movie. That's partly down to its darker atmosphere and relatively more complex plot, however the main issue with this is that it's a little bit too slow. There are periods where it really ramps up and gets properly exciting, but too often is there a time when you want to check your watch, because in the dialogue scenes, you're not getting the in-depth look at the characters that made those parts of the first film so good too.

Despite all that, however, this is still a really strong action film. Right from the kick-off, you're thrown into an action battle, and, as with the various fight sequences throughout, it's really exciting to watch, thanks to the fantastic directing by Joss Whedon, and the brilliant camera work that makes the action here look so slick in comparison to a lot of the excessive shaky-cam nowadays.

Also, the story is a lot more complex than the first film. Whilst this does have a bit of an impact on the entertainment factor, because you've got to think and pause on occasion, it's still an impressively intelligent plot with believably high stakes that will no doubt keep you intrigued from start to finish.

Finally, Ultron, the villain, is brilliant. The visual effects used to create him are excellent throughout, the voice performance by James Spader is great, and the bad guy's role in the film in not just threatening the safety of Earth, but also having some deeper impacts on the heroes, was a really interesting story too.

Overall, I'm going to give this a 7, because it's not as much fun as The Avengers, and it is on occasion too slow and too dark, however for the most part, it's still an exciting action movie that Marvel fans won't be disappointed by.",7
Perfect sequel.,24 April 2015,"I came into this movie not expecting the same feeling I left with after the first Avengers movie due to a lot of reviews I had read before hand. One thing that really concerned me was the 'lack of depth' I had seen mentioned.

This sequel is infinitely better than the first, all the characters are emotionally tied to the story and it makes every member of the team feel equal. As a fan of the comics I was amazed it did so much justice despite obvious set backs due to licensing the movies have been facing.

Minor characters quickly seemed more like main roles and the new characters instantly added to the story as well as leaving a huge neon sign of hope for the rest of Marvel's films.

GO WATCH IT!",9
Great sequel,4 May 2015,,
a better villain,30 May 2021,"The film may have wanted to say more than it could make stick but it provided fun full on fantasy fight scenes, an interesting introduction to new characters (a couple of my favorites), and most of all in a more compelling villain (compared to the first) who makes us consider who are the real monsters we want to save this world from and if this is something we can even do ourselves.",7
Best marvel movie in my opinion,17 November 2015,"This is by far one of my favorite movies from the MCU. The introduction of new Characters both good and bad also makes the movie more exciting. giving the characters more of a back story can also help audiences relate more to different characters better, and it connects a bond between the audience and actors or characters. Having seen the movie three times does not bother me here as it is as thrilling and exciting every time I am watching it. In other words, the movie is by far better than previous movies (and I do love everything Marvel), the plotting is splendid (they really do out do themselves in each film, there are no problems watching it more than once.",10
"it's okay, but mediocre compared to the first avengers movie.",4 June 2015,"Wasn't really impressed by this age of ultron sequel. first of all, the script doesn't really follow what the marvel universe has put down, Hank Pym created ultron not Tony stark. So if you're a marvel comics lover, you're going to be a tad disappointed. the CGI was okay and the fight scenes were a little bit under part, didn't really see hulk smash enough compared to the first avengers film. to be honest? this sequel had a little bit more drama with black widow catching feelings and stuff. the new characters scarlet witch and quicksilver were grossly underplayed, and at least we should have been given a hint about their origin(well everyone that reads the comics already knows, so I'll let that slip). and one more thing, vision was awful. definitely definitely needs a character revamp.",7
disappointing..,26 April 2015,"Me and my family watched a last full show of this film. We were in high spirits though it was already late. I have high expectations for this film since I really enjoyed the first Avengers film A LOT ( it never failed to entertain even after several viewing thru DVD). Oh gosh, I really have to force myself to enjoy this 2nd installment. I was looking for the same charm, the same heart, the same fluidity, that the first film had offered. I got bored of cheesy lines meant to be funny and somewhat ""forced"" attraction between Natasha and Bruce. The special effects are good which kept me awake though. Unlike the first one, I am not buying a DVD version of this one.",3
Meh,8 November 2020,"This is one of my least favorite Marvel movies. Even so, it's not terrible. It's got some great moments and a convincing villain.",7
Better in all aspects!,22 April 2015,"So we went and saw the movie tonight. We all had high expectations. And boy were we in for a surprise! This sequel was better in all the right ways you WANT a film to be better, for example all the jokes was REALLY funny, not the ones you see in certain movies where they try so hard but often fail, no in this one there was several times when most of the audience laughed out loud and they really nailed the fun stuff!!

There was not the ""30-40minutes"" non-stop meaningless action/fighting scenes that just steals away precious minutes of the film that some movies also have these days, this movie have in my opinion instead succeeded with having balanced the exact right amount of story/action. It never gets boring due to the lack of action or other way around to much story without action..

This is also the first movie that is +2h long that i didn't feel when the ending was near that ""oh no, has it already been 2h 20minutes"" i wanted it to be ""more"" and longer.. All the hobbit movies gave me that feeling although they all have more running time, so when you leave the theater after watching this im pretty sure you will feel like this one was not to long or to short.. A brilliant film in all ways..

Deserves a 10 in my opinion and i can promise that it will not disappoint you in any way. A movie you easy can take your gf with you to watch since there is a intense and good story behind it and its funny. But you do want to see the first avengers movie before this one since there is many things in this one that has to do with the first film.

My first review so just putting down my thoughts that came first to mind, and a big ""I'm sorry for my bad English"" :) Now go see the EASIEST best action movie of the year!!",10
"A Rather Disappointing Marvel Movie Let Down By Bizarre Plot Insertions, And Poor Character Development",8 October 2020,"Pros: 1. James Spaders' (Ultron) voice-acting performance, and Robert Downey Jr. (Tony Stark/ Iron Man), Mark Ruffalo (Bruce Banner/ Hulk), and Scarlett Johansson's (Natasha Romanoff/ Black Widow) performances are fantastic. 2. The CGI and practical effects look great, and are perfectly meshed together. 3. Most of the jokes, particularly between the Avengers, are set-up well and produce many laughs. 4. The set and costume design are mesmerising in their creation and scope. 5. The theme of humans messing around with nature is well-handled and timely, especially as we're seeing an increase in genetic engineering. 6. The score, though not as impressive as other Marvel movies, does it's job at fomenting an action-packed and adventurous atmosphere.

Cons: 1. The recurring joke about Captain America/ Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) opposing cursing is just unfunny and pointless. 2. The romance between Bruce Banner and Natasha Romanoff feels wholly forced, unnatural,and underdeveloped. 3. The final fight feels incredibly stale and flat as it involves a hoard of CGI robots getting destroyed. 4. The character of Pietro Maximoff/ Quicksilver is nowhere near fleshed-out enough, so his death falls resoundingly flat.",6
Avengers Age of Ultron - The bar has been set sky high once again!!! 9.8/10,22 April 2015,,9
A good seqeul to the Avengers,30 March 2021,"Sequels tends to be worst than the predecessor but this was quiet a surprise. It's just what you expect in an action packed super hero movie. There isn't anything special or some Matrix level meaning to it, not a bad movie to waste two hours on.

An alright story with some flaws. The writing was a bit odd at times and the atmosphere and tone was inconsistent at times. Though the cinematography and the camera work was great with likable CGI and music. The most notable problem I had was with the script/dialogue.

Overall a semi enjoyable film

Another Perfect Marvel Movie,30 April 2015,,10
"Comedown from previous entries, but still good",6 December 2023,"I'm doing the Infinity Saga for the first time, we've had a lot of quality in the last few movies, with the last entry Guardian of the Galaxy bagging a rare 9/10 after thrilling Iron Man/Thor/Cap adventures and the first great Avengers movie.

Age of Ultron feels like a bit of a comedown from all of them: it's certainly inferior to Guardians, feeling less fresh, less imaginative...less fun. And a comedown from Iron Man 3, Thor 2 & Cap 2...feels like the world got smaller, which is probably not the right move for a flagship Avengers movie.

As it is: Avengers 2 is a decent sci-fi adventure tale of Ai-gone-awol. A tropey premise, with entertaining voice performance from James Spader. We get a handful of fine character moments from the Avengers, some impressive FX, a couple of X-Men-like additions....we're entertained, but something is missing. A particular 'Wow!' feeling. The film even drags a little at times. We don't even get much in the way of arc-heavy Saga, which is another reason why it feels like a comedown...almost like a filler movie after Guardians of the Galaxy.

However, let's be fair to the picture taken at its own merits: it's good. Not great. Not bad. Better than most CGI-driven action-blockbuster fare that's not Marvel. Worth a watch either as standalone or as part of the Saga. I just can't imagine anyone naming this as their favourite.

Marvel's Best Film Yet,24 April 2015,"I've recently returned from the cinema after seeing Avengers: Age of Ultron, which was released in UK cinemas yesterday, and I have to say; Marvel have really outdone themselves.

Upon first hearing about the premise of the film, and especially after seeing the first teaser, I was very sceptical. The CGI looked mediocre and the villain, story, and minions seemed like a complete rehash of the first film. However I was pleasantly surprised to find that in cinemas the CGI is terrific, easily some of the best I've ever seen.

The villain was original, and actually a very likable and extremely interesting character. I was worried the use of a robot army would seem to much like the Chitauri, however they were very different in the way they attacked, the way they were defeated, and they each had a personality and some real depth and character to them. One even plays a crucial part in the climax of the final battle.

Another thing I was worried about was the possibility of there being too many characters, but it worked perfectly. The twins didn't seem underdeveloped, and Ultron and the Vision especially had a lot of personality. The transition of the twins from villains to Avengers worked extremely well, and all of the Avengers continued to be developed and given further depth.

This brings me on to the acting. Apart from the twins' accents - which actually didn't annoy me as much as I thought they would, but were still a tad unnecessary - the acting was stupendous. James Spader was perfect as Ultron, from the deep and menacing snarls all the way to the character's lighter, more sarcastic tones. All of the original cast retained their excellent performances from the first, if not giving better ones, and the newly added cast, specifically Elizabeth Olsen and whoever played Clint's associate (trying not to spoil a big moment) were all beautifully realistic, passionate, and strong, and all of the performances and splendid writing lead to a perfect mixture of action, tragedy, and comedy.

In conclusion; the film is a masterpiece, easily the film of the year, and easily the best film Marvel Studios has ever produced. I recommend it to anyone and everyone, and I rate it 1000,000,000,000,000,000 out of 10",10
Very disappointing but not bad,6 October 2023,,7
Shockingly bad,25 April 2015,"I am amazed of the 8.5 that this movie has right now and how people consider it good.

My 5 star note is not a hater's note. By the contrary, I went to the cinema with some hopes that this is going to be better than the previous one.

Major disappointment. The only thing good is the CGI. There are indeed very nice special effects, you can't tell the difference from the real stuff. However, this film has absolutely nothing else to give.

When will Marvel learn to make a good movie? This is even worse than Iron Man 3, can you believe it? One again they've advertised it as ""dark"", but by now we should already know what that means for them.

The action if full of non-sense, the plot is once again childish and the character interaction very superficial, cheesy and very annoying, if you come to think that this is the n-th movie with these guys. The scenes just don't tie up, they always have you wonder ""why would they do that"".

The only thing that the movie has to show you is some superheroes fighting against supposedly powerful and wicked, yet surprisingly useless, inefficient enemies. One more, you are supposed to say ""wow did you see how Thor threw that hammer?"", ""how powerful Hulk is!"" etc., and disregard any logic about what is really going on there.

You never get to care about where the plot is going. Halfway through the movie I found myself bored to death (be advised: I'm a huge fan of comic books) and always waiting for it to end.

Also, you are again supposed to believe no human is actually hurt in all those fights. Cities are destroyed, yet no one is injured.

When you see some outrageous breaking of the laws of physics, you will be without reaction, because you are already in shock of how bad this movie is.",5
A Terrifying Ultron Would've Made The Film Better!,12 March 2022,"Burdened by a frankly weak adaptation of its main antagonist, it is easy to see why Age of Ultron was dwarfed by other Avenger films. As far as entertainment goes, no fault here as we remain treated with stepped up, high level action sequences compared to its 2012 predecessor. The new characters are truly a welcome sight as well! Happily, Scarlet Witch, Quicksilver and Vision (and even the Hulk-buster!) were each given their moments to show how awesome they are and they delivered. Ultron however, garners mixed feelings. His introduction in the after party scene was powerful, as he delivers a poignant speech on how insufficient the Avengers are. Sadly, it was all downhill from there as Ultron was effectively a witty punching bag, the heroes played around with. He was severely underpowered based on abilities he is perceived to possess! This evidently led to a head scratching, one sided final battle that is drenched with cheesy and corny taglines, and ""kick Ultron's ass and send him flying"" scenes. This shortcoming however, does not take away the film as a major turning point in the franchise as we witness internal friction due to difference in ideologies plus, the film finally introduces the concept of Infinity Stones, a perfect prelude for the films to come. Id give this flawed yet highly entertaining film a 7/10.",7
Everything you wanted it to be,22 April 2015,"Quickie Review:

The Avengers are now a fully functioning team stopping other groups who have nefarious agendas. On one of their missions, Tony (Robert Downey Jr.) comes across a dormant peacekeeping program. When activated the program named Ultron (James Spader) sees only one solution to achieve peace, human extinction. One of the most highly anticipated movies of the year, Avengers: Age of Ultron has a lot to live up to, and it achieves it in spades. This is not a shallow action film, it is a direct sequel to the first Avengers continuing the story of the team and their relationships. Ultron posed a formidable threat to our heroes, and he did it with confidence and attitude. Avengers AOU is an action-packed, funny, geek out inducing, and most importantly an all-out fun movie that you will want to see multiple times.

Full Review:

I've been looking forward to this movie not for days, weeks, or months. No, I've been waiting for years. So much so that I went for the midnight premiere on a working day. My expectations were sky- high and wow I left the cinema ecstatic and with a giant smile on my face.

Right from the start we kick off with an amazing action scene showing the whole Avengers team taking on the bad guys. I was covered in nerd goosebumps. It shouldn't be a surprise that all the action sequences were top notch. In fact, they are better than the first Avengers because you get to see more of their teamwork. It is exciting to see how they communicate and improvise off of each other's tools and skills. As amazing as these scenes were, the strange thing is they weren't even the best parts of the movie. What I enjoyed the most was the banter between all the characters. The witty dialog had me laughing countless times. I think I can safely say, this was the funniest Marvel movie so far. Yes Avengers AOU is also the darkest film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe but director Joss Whedon always found a way to not let that compromise the fun. A large part of that had to do with the way the characters were handled.

These are not the same heroes we knew from Avengers, they have changed, there are new relationships and priorities. All of that brought a new dynamic within the team we hadn't seen before. Everyone, including the new additions such as Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) get their fair share of screen time to shine. Even, Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) was finally shown as a badass. He was integral to keeping the team together when things were at their worst. Now let's talk about the guy who was making Avengers' day worse, Ultron. In the trailers he is shown as a menacing villain with an imposing presence, and that is true physically but his personality was more than that. In many ways he had more base human traits than you might expect: fear, jealousy, anger, and most surprisingly a great sense of humor. He had a great cocky attitude about everything he did, which was a dimension to the character that I didn't anticipate but fit really into the tone of the movie.

There is so much more I want to talk about but I want you to experience it all yourself. The vastly overwhelming positives drown out any ""complaints"" I have. Seriously there were moments I couldn't contain myself from cheering and I was not alone in that. So many times the cinema burst into joyous laughter and thunderous applause. Avengers AOU is everything I wanted it to be, more fun, more action, more epicness that make even the most casual viewer's inner nerd come out of the cinema drooling for more.

P.S. There is only one mid-credits scene. Once you see that scene you can leave the cinema knowing you are not missing anything.

Good,19 January 2022,"A very interesting movie, as usual in the style of the Avengers. Tony Stark, well, what can I say about him, as always, he's great. I'm always amazed by his acting, and it's not just about the Avengers, it's DIVINE to take his other films. I advise everyone to watch this movie, just like the whole Marvel movie.",7
Let's talk some avenging avengers!,25 April 2015,"How are you doing guys? Did you have a nice day? Well I did considering the fact that I saw the freaking sequel of the avengers; The one where their the age of Ultron is happening.

Im not going to spoil anything for you guys... My spoiler-free review.. here we go:

Acting: 10/10 the acting was great as expected. Downey Jr. kills it as iron man, though he's less in the spotlights than I thought it would be. It actually a more.. hawkeye/hulk movie this time around. There is also a lot of character development going on, which I thought was really cool.. I missed that connection the first time around in the first avengers. Especially Hawkeye, the hulk en Black widow get a bit more characteristic, which I thought was great.. and the voice- acting of the guys playing SPOILER(KIND OF) Vision and Ultron are also perfect for the role.

Camera work: 10/10. This doesn't apply to all movies, but in movies like this.. The camera work is really essential.. use too much shaky-cam and you're done as a director. Josh Wedon is just a CHAMP in filming everything with the right angle and A still camera.. I hate shaky-cam.. draws away from the fight or whatever is happening.. Great JOB MR. WHEDON

Action: 11/10 Now the ACTION; it... was... AWESOME... Immediately going into this movie.. the title has not even been shown yet.. and the first action sequence kicks in..and OMG.. it was shot.. so perfectly.. you're actually following each and everyone doing their thing for a bit.. looked a bit like a tag-team fight.. so awesome.. the hulk vs. hulk-buster scene was perfect.. the fight in Korea.. awesome.. and the last fight of course was incredible as well..

Villain: 10/10 The villain this time around is amazing. You know what the best villains are? The ones who don't consider themselves as villains.. They just want to do good.. help people.. so they have a goal that they don't have out of hatred, or misplaced anger, but because of a certain dedication to it.. and with the right motivation you can do anything.. That's what Ultron is in this movie.. He's so menacing.. but also surprisingly funny.. and no.. not in the annoying way! In the way you want a villain to be funny.. Stark: "".. What's the Vibranium for? "" Ultron ""Im glad you asked that, because you wanted to take this time to explain my evil plan"". Hilarious! It's so.. Stark to say that from Ultron! Hahaha!Ultron is so different from loki(because I never took him seriously as a unstoppable force)

The only flaw that I have with this movie: 1. There is a romance between 2 characters which I did not like.. It seemed forced.. unnecessary and for me took the character of one of the two down.. considering I thought she/he was the most emotionally stable of the group

So overall.. Such a good movie.. it will never be as awesome as the first time these heroes came together in the first movie.. but the fact these heroes actually became friends was perfect..I bought.. I'm gonna go see it again on Tuesday.. maybe even again if money agrees with me..

10 out of 10 for this amazingly fun, great, awesome movie.",8
Bit of a stumble for an otherwise fine movie,25 August 2022,"The villain in this one was lousy. James Spader's voice acting is straight up atrocious. He's a fine actor but is completely miscast in this role. The rest of the actors are solid, some are quite compelling. Sadly, the action scenes are often so busy that occasionally they loose their suspense. Thankfully, there are some lovely quiet moments where the characters talk or simply take in the moment during the biggest battle. Those were generally the most effective scenes of the battle. There is a good deal to like here, and the villain was a real threat, but he was so poorly voiced that it hampered my suspension of disbelief. So far this seemed to be the weakest of the Avengers movies. It isn't a bad movie, but it doesn't have the tension or charm of the others.",6

Good but Disappointing,11 September 2022,,7
This uncanny movie directed by Joss Whedon is still pretty marvelous.,29 April 2015,,8
Not as bad as I first thought or as the critics say.,25 June 2021,"I remember not liking it so much when I first saw it, and the reviews and ratings here are not very kind, but it actually not that bad at all. Re-watching it as part of my MCU marathon, it definitely has a place in building the world leading to Infinity War. Not only that but the story is still interesting on its own and you do get that Marvel level of polish in directing and special effects. I think if that movie had been made in the same tone as the later MCU flicks, it would have been much better. And I for one love James Spader's Ultron.",7
Age of utter dumbness,7 May 2015,,1
Nothing felt deep but enjoyable nonetheless,27 February 2024,"The second Avengers movie following a more or less same formula of a new threat first lose and then save the world. Some new players entered the game which were likable but the most exciting part was definitely the build up to something big by introducing another infinity stone and that post credit scene really sets you up for the future the comedy was good and as for ultron i mean he was bland they tried to make his action look something different but in all honesty it was as bland as the the other villains like

FAVORITE CHARACTER :: HAWKYE (without a doubt felt the most real) FAVORITE MOMENT :: CAP VS TONY ON CREATING VISION.",7
Great Movie ! A WORTHY adaptation of Earth's Mightiest Heroes,29 April 2015,"Wow. Just Wow. Marvel actually did, they made a movie that may have topped all of their other movies. (Cap 2 is the only real competition).

So, Avengers: Age Of Ultron begins with a bang, literally, the first ten minutes are this massive Avengers Vs. Hyrda action sequence that is out of this world. Here we see Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, The Hulk, Black Widow, and Hawkeye re-assemble for one of the most exiting, squeal worthy movie scenes ever. This scene also introduces us to two new characters, Quicksilver (who Movie Buffs already know from ""X-Men: Days Of Future Past"") and his twin sister, The Scarlet Witch. At first I was sceptical about these two, however as the movie progressed they slowly became some of my favourite ""Avengers"" characters. Another thing that I found cool about these two is that their powers are quite different and something that separates them and this movie from the Original Avengers. Making for some awesome visual effects.

As usual with these movies, the actors completely nail their roles. Even after all these years Robert Downey Jr. just IS Tony Stark, he once again owns the role and completely redeems the character after the horror that was ""Iron Man 3"". Chris Evans once again completely owns the role of Captain America, perfectly portraying both his old-fashion ideals and his completely bad-ass side perfectly. The other stand-out of the movie, one whom I did not expect, was Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye. That's right, Hawkeye, who was formerly Marvel's worst adaptation of a comic character after the Mandarin, is now awesome. He finally gets a back-story and motivation for his character and just kills it. Also, Hawkeye, much like his comic book-counter part, gets the funniest lines in the movie. (""I could do it, No one would know""). I could right about how every actor is perfect forever, but it would take me too long, these 3 (and another who I will get to later) are the stand-outs of the film, however the others all portray their characters to perfection as well (especially Chirs Hemsworth, Elizabeth Olsen, and Aaron Taylor-Johnson).

Now the biggest change from the comics is for sure the personality of Ultron, it is to be expected seeing as in the movie Ultron's personality was based off of Tony Stark instead of Hank Pym. I however came to accept this version of Ultron. James Spader was just born to play (voice) this role. I felt for Ultron and understood his motivations and why he wanted to do what he did. I even felt sympathy for his character in certain parts of this movie. He see's humanity through a fresh, un-biased set of eyes and doesn't agree with modern-civilization. I will say that Ultron may have had one to many joke-lines, but I can cope with it. Now Thor, Ultron, Hawkeye and The Scarlet Witch are all great but my favourite character in the movie was by far The Vision, played by Paul Bettany. I don't want to give to much away about this character, but he is just brilliant and I can't wait to see more of him.

The only reason I gave the movie 9 instead of 10 (It would be like a 9.5 if I had that option) was because it did feel a little rushed. I feel sorry for the non-Marvel fans going into the theatre as they may have trouble understanding what's going on. I've heard that the original cut was about 3 and half hours and you really can tell that they cut things out, that being said I've also heard that an extended edition will be released, and I think that version of the movie may become my favourite movie of all time.

Overall, Avengers: Age Of Ultron is just about as good as a superhero movie can get it makes you laugh, cry, squeal in nerd-glee, and then at the end leaves you dying for more. Oh and since the line got cut in the movie.....AVENGERS ASSEMBLE !",10
"a bit bloated, but good action movie",10 June 2015,"in a vacuum, this is a pretty good action movie, but being a sequel to ""the avengers"" means it will always invite comparisons to the original and be judged at a higher standard. Unfortunately, ""age of ultron"" doesn't live up to it's predecessor. The action and humor is still there. Joss Whedon excels at crafting these fluid elaborate action scenes where the camera pans between multiple characters kicking ass in their own way and then occasional teaming up to take down some bad guys. It's pretty impressive to see considering the size of the Avengers roster and the extreme differences in each superhero's powers. Humor-wise, we have typical Whedon jokes, but I'd argue that there's a bit too many going around in the midst of all the fighting this time. Some jokes felt forced, with characters spewing one-liners every time they got any screen time during an action scene.

Plot-wise, the writing is less focused than the first one. There's a scene where Thor goes into a cave somewhere, submerges himself in water, and starts having dream-like visions of the future, and this doesn't make much sense or seem necessary. Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch are woefully underdeveloped, with a boring backstory and bad clichéd Eastern European accents. With all the details packed into this film, it seems like Marvel's trying too hard to connect the dots between all their properties and set things up for the future, and this comes at the expense of the movie as a whole.

One of the bright spots is James Spader's portrayal of Ultron. Instead of being this stereotypical cold, calculated, terminator-like villain, his personality is that of a spoiled, petulant, mischievous child, and it works pretty well.",7

Great Movie with full energy and fun,24 April 2015,,10
A Thrilling Superhero Adventure,21 May 2023,"Avengers: Age of Ultron is a thrilling superhero film that lives up to the hype of its predecessor. The film follows the Avengers as they face a new enemy, Ultron, an artificial intelligence program designed to protect the world but turns against humanity. The Avengers must work together to stop Ultron's plans and save the world once again.

The film is directed by Joss Whedon and features an all-star cast, including Robert Downey Jr., Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, and Jeremy Renner. The chemistry between the actors is palpable, and their performances are top-notch. The film also introduces new characters, such as the twins Pietro and Wanda Maximoff, played by Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen, who add to the overall depth and richness of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

The action sequences in this film are simply breathtaking, with intricate fight scenes and explosive set pieces that keep you on the edge of your seat. The special effects are top-notch, and the visuals are stunning, making for an immersive cinematic experience.

One of the strengths of this film is its ability to balance humor and drama. The dialogue is witty and clever, and the humor is well-placed and never feels forced. At the same time, the film also tackles serious themes, such as artificial intelligence and the consequences of playing God.

Overall, Avengers: Age of Ultron is a must-see for any superhero fan. With its thrilling action, strong performances, and engaging storyline, it is a worthy addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe.",7
amazing movie,24 April 2015,"This movie was really good, it was one of the best movies I have actually seen in a long time. The amount of action they had was amazing. It was also filled with Some comedy as well which were filled in well. I also liked the the use of characters they put Into this movie, and for viewers that read this review I recommend watching this movie you would really really enjoy this action packed film. It compacted with the first one and that is one way to create a good sequel to a movie because you can remember the things that happened in the 1st movie and then you can link it up with this film ""Avengers Age Of Ultron"" I would like them to try and make another film of the Avengers. A Big congrats to the man Stan Lee he has been a marvel creator for some time and in my opinion every marvel movie that he has made will be a good movie.",10
Important,10 November 2021,"The movie might not be as good as the first, but no one can deny that it is still a spectacular sequel. The movie is way bigger than the last one and has a lot of great action, the villain is trying to accomplish something, the heroes are stopping the villain, so it's just pretty much 2 hours of the heroes trying to stop the villain witch means that the whole time there is just action, there aren't to many boring scenes either, most of the scenes that aren't just pure fun action are scenes that are still important to the story. The finale is also great, it's a giant battle and you can't understate how amazing it is. The movie also introduces some new important characters, and all the characters in the movie get some great story development.

So it might not be as good as the first one, but it is still truly a solid sequel, an important movie for the MCU, and a great addition to the MCU.",7
A Major Disappointment!,24 April 2015,"If disappointment had lost a literal definition, it would be 'Avengers: Age of Ultron'. A lazy, soulless sequel, that shames its prequel & also the prolific superheroes. Despite the best of graphics & stars in hand, this summer bigger suffers from a stilted narrative.

'Avengers: Age of Ultron' Synopsis: When Tony Stark tries to jump-start a dormant peacekeeping program, things go awry and it is up to the Avengers to stop the villainous Ultron from enacting his terrible plans.

'Avengers: Age of Ultron' has only one saving grace & that's its graphics. The visuals are marvelous & the action-sequences are expertly choreographed. But, the narrative is stilted & soulless. Also, the pace is dreadfully slow in the first-hour. I was throughly bored in this hour, almost in disbelief if this one is actually a marvel movie.

Joss Whedon's Screenplay is a downer. He made a terrific film previously, but this time around, he has faltered. The Writing Material surrenders to graphics & makes very less use of its own strength. Whedon's Direction, on the other-hand, is fair. Cinematography is alright. Editing is loose, the film runs for a long 142-minutes!

The Avengers, however, do well. Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark / Iron Man, donning the part for the fifth time, hasn't lost his charm. Chris Hemsworth as Thor, is excellent here, while Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner/Hulk, looks tired. Chris Evans as Steve Rogers / Captain America, has his moments. Scarlett Johansson as Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow, is passable. Jeremy Renner as Clint Barton / Hawkeye, is a pleasant surprise here. He actually gets scope to perform this time & he does. Aaron Taylor-Johnson as Quicksilver & Elizabeth Olsen as Scarlet Witch, add freshness in the proceedings. James Spader as Ultron, is the biggest letdown. He gives the villain a hammy turn, which by no means, works.

On the whole, 'Avengers: Age of Ultron' is very high on hype, but low on substance.",5
There is somethiing missing,6 May 2022,"It is definitely not a bad movie by any means, but compared to the original, it felt short. The most entertaining and exciting stuff about this movie is the interactions between the characters and the fights. The characters as usual, are super enjoyable to watch and the fights are some of the best. But besides that everyting else is okay, but just that. Ultron is boring to see and his motivations dont make sense, and his face looks very weird. The plot of the avengers trying to find him, isnt really that interesting nd there are moments that feel added just for the sake of teasing future movies. But also on the good thigns are the new inclusions of new heroes like the scarlet witch and vision. But as I said, the interactions of the characters and the fights arent enough. It really felt short compared to the og avengers.",7
Avengers: Age of Ultron could be the greatest superhero movie of all time.,24 April 2015,"I went into Avengers: Age of Ultron knowing that I was about to watch an excellent movie. I wasn't wrong. From the first action sequence to the last, Age of Ultron was visually spectacular. The characters and their motives were as always, very interesting. Ultron for example, he is the evil version of Tony Stark; they can't tell the difference between saving people and destruction. That is conveyed very well in the movie kept we intrigued as to what will happen next.

NEW CHARACTERS: Quicksilver was visually a pleasure to see and I loved how protective he is over his sister. The Scarlet Witch is possibly my second favorite Avenger next to Captain America. Like Quicksilver's, her powers are a visual spectacle. Her powers are also far more intriguing than anyone else's. She has a very interesting personality, but her personality seems to be guided by her powers. The Vision is only introduced about three quarters of the way into the movie, and he is a complex character. He isn't J.A.R.V.I.S., nor is he Ultron. He has his own individual personality and it is complex.

10/10 Avengers: Age of Ultron could be the greatest superhero movie of all time. It's definitely the best one I have ever seen.",8
A bit lacking.,23 December 2023,"Not quite hitting the heights of the first Avengers film, but still an enjoyable watch. New characters are introduced which the director must juggle with the existing team.

Ultron was a good villain, menacing but snarky and not too brooding. The tone is a bit more subdued than the first film with a colour palette to match.

The love story between Bruce Banner and Black Widow was a bit out of left field and brought back memories of other awkward forced love stories in recent films like Spock and Uhura in Stark Trek (2009) and Bruce and Rachel in Batman Begins (2004). Another problem with it is there are too many set-ups without pay-offs.",6
Another Masterpiece from Marvel Universe,26 April 2015,"Avengers: Age of Ultron... Definitely my favorite movie of the year... Joss Whedon definitely nailed it. The movie is absolutely electrifying and quite a smashing cocktail of various genres. Keep it up MARVEL Universe!!! Quite ingenious I must say. I was beginning to think that the whole superhero movie franchise were becoming rather redundant with a lot of clichéd story lines and just senseless action without really connecting to the audience but Joss Whedon definitely gave me a run for my money and a movie I can ruminate on at least for the rest of the year. The movie was a brilliant masterpiece with a perfect blend of romance, comedy, action, and thrill. Its a shame though that Joss wouldn't be directing the next set of Avengers forthcoming because I really think the guy's a hybrid of Talent and Genius.",10

Mixed sequel,1 March 2020,"This is probably not the film fans were expecting, including myself. Whedon had an idea of what he wanted to include, but it sounds like he struggled to create the film he wanted with execs. This wasn't a straight forward sequel and when you consider phase 2 overall, this doesn't deliver. I enjoyed the film, but it's bloated and Ultron doesn't have a real impact. Whedon was maybe ambitious with the film, and this resulted in him leaving the series. There's some interesting idea's here, but it feels like a step to the next Avengers film, much like Iron Man 2 was to the first Avengers.",7

Most people will enjoy watching this epic comic book collaboration. Ultron, the film's antagonist, serves as a great villain with an interesting god complex, and the movie is surprisingly deep. However the film suffers from some spotty special effects (which is surprising considering that Marvel had one of the best visual effects companies in the world working on it), some uneven tone, and rushed pacing (especially in terms of Ultron's creation). That being said, while it's not as good as The Avengers, Age of Ultron makes up for it's shortcomings with great dialogue and a gigantic climax, and is a great time at the theaters.",9
Very good...,10 February 2022,"""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" is an Action - Sci-Fi movie in which we watch the Avengers joining their forces in order to defend Earth from the villainous Ultron, a program started by Tony Stark and Bruce Banner as a peace keeping robot.

I enjoyed this movie very much because it had a nice and interesting plot that contained plenty of action and much of suspense. The direction which was made by Joss Whedon was very good and he presented very well the plot of the movie without creating any plot holes. The interpretations of Robert Downey Jr. Who played as Tony Stark, Chris Hemsworth who played as Thor, Chris Evans who played as Steve Rogers, Scarlett Johansson who played as Natasha Romanoff and Mark Ruffalo who played as Bruce Banner were simply amazing and their combination worked very well. To sum up, I have to say that ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" is an interesting super-hero movie and I highly recommend everyone to watch it.",7
An Exhilarating Super-powered ride that barely manages to hold its strings together,22 April 2015,"*There are no strings on me*

First of all, huge kudos to Joss Whedon for wanting to take the job as the director of this mammoth movie. The sheer scale of this film is both huge and yet smaller at the same time as compared to the last outing. And yet, Whedon manages to pull it all together, despite a few loose strings, and deliver an exuberant two-and-a-half hour thrill ride with the mighty Avengers as they try to stop the technological enemy who is bent on human extinction, Ultron.

Despite the Avengers' fight for peace, not all the people in the world adore them. Realizing that the Avengers need a hiatus, Tony Stark attempts to jump-start a peace-keeping program Ultron so that they can take a break from saving the world. However, things quickly go wrong as Ultron immediately decides that peace can only be achieved through the obliteration of human life.

The film is simultaneously bigger yet also smaller in scale. On one hand, all of the conflict is based on Earth and therefore, there are no aliens involved (at least until the end of this film), and yet despite the smaller canvas, it becomes much denser as more characters are involved, not to forget the main villain himself. Handling a film this big is not easy and Whedon tries his best to develop his characters and while he doesn't accomplish this perfectly, he does it well enough that we get to roughly know what troubles each of these characters. And it's also welcoming that he spends more time with characters that don't have their own standalone movies such as Hawkeye, Hulk, and Black Widow.

Ultron is an interesting villain because he's different from other artificial intelligence villains. While it is true that his motives are based on logic, it's that he has a personality that sets him apart. He was jump-started by Stark, so therefore he inherits some of Stark's attributes such as his sarcasm and dry wit. But he's technological, he doesn't need the Chitauri army, he can make his own, he can reproduce at incredible rates, he can upgrade himself. He also has another perspective on the definition of peace. As long as he has access to the Internet, he's virtually unstoppable. Unlike Loki who's deceptive and mischievous, Ultron's straightforward. But the true standout was James Spader's voice. His voice was menacing, powerful and gave Ultron his signature feature.

Ultron's not the only newcomer. There's also the Maximoff twins, Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch. The twins are not ""mutants"" but rather, a result of an experimentation conducted by Hydra member Baron von Strucker. They've suffered a harsh past and therefore, they have a very strong bond as they protect each other. Quicksilver can run incredibly fast psychic powers. These two characters provide something fresh to the film as their powers are visual delights (although that one scene from ""X- Men: Days of Future Past"" remains superior) but they're among the crowded canvas of super-powered characters in this film. Therefore, their characterizations are not that extensive but enough for us to relate to them and to keep the action engaging. (There's also the Vision, but it's much better that he remains as mysterious as he is now.)

Talking about the action, the action sequences are absolutely outstanding. We get an adequate dose of each character kicking ass and showcasing their powers and abilities. One thing I enjoyed was that the action took place in different locations all around the world and this was very nice to see that the conflict was global and just kept it fresh. Most of the time, I just gasped in awe and just was astonished by just how awesome the action was. Some of the shots were so jaw-dropping I wished I could immortalize them into posters. It brought my inner geek out. Apart from being exhilarating, it was also humorous and that's also another primary reason I loved about this film. Some movies work well with a dark and brooding atmosphere, but I loved that this one was not so gritty but instead, more fun and just more about the adrenaline- filled ride. But all this wouldn't be a fully baked cake without a brilliant script. The script, although unable to delve deep into each character's mind (wished Scarlet Witch explored more), ultimately reminds us that despite their incredible powers, the Avengers are still humans and have faults, and this makes them feel real and to be rooted for.

Rating: 9/10

Final Verdict: It can't help but feel very crowded but Whedon ultimately manages to keep all of the gargantuan content together, despite a few slipped strings, and deliver a hugely sensational and satisfying sequel to 2012's ""The Avengers"".

"Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015, Joss Whedon) While not as adept as the first Avengers this is still quite good... a bit underrated in my opinion",2 July 2021,,7
"A good worthy sequel, but without exceeding expectations",23 April 2015,"After the first Avengers film 3 years ago, we finally get to see the gang back together again! Being one of the most highly anticipated films of 2015, can Marvel deliver its magic once again with a slightly darker, serious and slightly complex plot line? (don't worry, not as dark and serious as the Dark Knight Trilogy or Man of Steel) Well, safely to say, it's still undeniably another massively entertaining and enjoyable feast for Marvel fans. There are more awesome and cooler action sequences, wonderful character moments with funny witty dialogues, spectacular visuals with more new Avenger characters filling in this time around. With writer/director Joss Whedon at helm again with all the same actors reprising their roles, the film still feels lively with the occasional team banters.

There's a lot to deliver in Avengers: Age of Ultron...aside from the main plot line, world-building, bigger and better action scenes that needs to be in the sequel, it needs to set up the beginnings of Marvel's Phase 3 plans as well. As a result, there are lots of subplots and references going around in the film for fans to take note of: Tony and Steve clashing ideologies for Captain America: Civil War, mentioning of Wakanda and the introduction of Ulysses Klaw, enemy of Black Panther and Thor's vision of Asgard for Thor: Ragnarok and Infinity War. So it's definitely not an easy task for Joss Whedon to juggle with so many characters in the same film. Thankfully, every hero does get their chance to shine. Surprisingly, Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow and Clint Barton/Hawkeye have bigger roles this time around and are more involved than before with their character arcs. The film is very clear with its theme, by showing how misguided intentions, no matter how noble they may be, could potentially lead to more death and destruction.

The action scenes are very well choreographed with superb, top notch CGI effects. Hulk is getting more screen time smashing several Ultron robots with his fists, and even Iron Man, himself too. The massive, destructive battle between the Hulkbuster Mark 44 Iron Man suit against the Hulk is definitely one of the highlights of the film. Captain America, Hulk, Thor, Iron Man, Black Widow, Hawkeye, Scarlet Witch, Quicksilver, Vision, they all have a good balance of action screen time to show their abilities against Ultron and his robotic armies (except for War Machine and Falcon, which have a slightly minor role compared with the rest). The final climactic battle of the film is certainly the most over-the-top, ""comic booky"" thing ever put on screen (not sure it's a good or bad thing).

With that being said, now comes the bad part. The film has too many new characters introduced in this sequel and not enough character development to make them memorable (despite the film's long running time) and this hurts the film a lot. The 'Enchanced' Twins' origins were simply brushed off by a few lines from the main characters and Vision's powers were not clearly explained in the film. Moreover, there's too much going on that there's simply no time for the casual audience (non-Marvel fans) to take a breather and slowly digest the new plot and character developments.

There were lots of sudden plot developments shoehorned into the story: forced romance between Banner/Hulk and Natasha/Black Widow (When did Natasha start having feelings for Banner?), the introduction of two vital team members - Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch, the birth and introduction of Vision, the increased development of Hawkeye, the introduction and development of the main villain, Ultron. Not to mention, there are other members of the gang needs to be on the spotlight as well.

The main villain, Ultron is rather disappointing. His motivations of destroying humanity aren't clear enough, his grudge against Tony feels rushed and underdeveloped, which makes him less compelling. In comparison, Scarlet Witch is a far more terrifying force compared to Ultron as the film clearly shows that she has the power to tear the whole team (Avengers) apart like they were nothing.

In short, is Avengers: Age of Ultron as good as The Avengers? Well, it's near there and it's good enough, but without exceeding expectations. It seems that the film is quite rushed and fast-paced due to the editing cuts needed to make the film shorter (the first cut is said to be roughly 3 hours). The script does feel slightly weaker than the more well-constructed first film, but the action, witty dialogue is more than enough to make up for it. With the release of The Avengers: Age of Ultron, Marvel's second Phase is coming to an end very soon (after this year's Ant-Man).

MORE CHARACTERS BUT LESS AMUSING,21 July 2022,The production and visual effects sure look amazing but the myriad of supporting characters did not help with the overall impact of the film. The storyline was solid even though it was a bit ordinary for MCU movies. The emotional leverage for the characters of Hulk ane Iron Man was an interesting addition to the story because it provided depth to the plot.,7
'Overrated' does not even get close,2 May 2015,"After watching this movie I visited IMDb to check for some photos and well - I was shocked to see a current rating of 8,2. I do not know how this could be true, I mean the same rating as masterpieces hold like ""Heat"", ""Pan's Labyrinth"" or ""Die Hard"". Either this world is about to face the apocalypse of morons or ""taste"" became something to chose in the McDonald's menu...

Nevertheless, this movie is not crap, you might watch it if you prefer a story full of plot holes big enough to hide at least a group of a hundred Hulks in them and characters as pale and static as the Terracotta Army in the famous Chinese grave. Besides, this film has SFX. And it is a hell of a thunderstorm of SFX... I stopped counting after the 10th SFX company listed in the credits. So if your age starts with a 1 and has no more than another digit to follow, you might be entertained and amused about all these effects, virtually in every single scene. But if you expect a little more from a movie, like well developed characters, a good story with a consistent plot and something to entertain your intellect, this would not become the best choice.

It's probably nice for watching it once, beer and popcorn at hand and forgetting about it the very next day again. However, if you expect a little more like described above, you will just waste your money on this film.",4
Chekov's Hammer,2 May 2024,"After nearly ten years away from consuming the MCU (a mixture of self-denial and not knowing where to start) my partner and I plunged back in with the sequel to 2012's Avengers. It's still got Whedon's giddy setpieces, the core ensemble hold together remarkably well with the exception of the undercooked romance between Widow and Hulk. They never knew what to do with ScarJo, and that this ends up being her biggest slab of screentime until the solo film is a shame. That being said, the central narrative thread is fairly strong and there are some really great moments here (Ultron's first ghoulish appearance, Hulkbuster battle). The foreshadowing holds up well and Ultron ends up looking like a solid road map for all that was to come.",7

Age of Blandtron,16 June 2019,"Avengers Age of Ultron is a mess. Not as much as the dark world. But still a mess. Finds it difficult to strike a balance between story and bad guys vs. Good guys. Acrion gets a little mind numbing. James Spader does a fine job making a good villain. And Danny Elfman does what he always does, makes great superhero music. The two highlights of this film. It's a not quite darker entry. But more of a grey entry. It's a little bleek. And very grey. The main plot is Tony Stark messes up and 2 hours of them trying to fix it. Sets up the growing tension between stark and Cap well. Get us ready for Civil War. Just enough cool stuff happens to save it. 66%",6

"Despite the amazing action packed scenes and the interesting premise, the movie ends falling by its own weight.",7 November 2021,"Avengers: Age of Ultron is the direct sequel of the great cinematic event that was 2012'2 Avengers and is, in no way, as good as its predecessor. The film can be described as a mess, an entertaining one though, only thanks to the three or four action sequences scattered throughout it. The villain had a potential to be something big, like really, really big, but ends up feeling like nothing special. And the plot relies heavily on just stopping this ""big bad"" from destroying the world with a crazy plan, and lacking of real consequences to the characters, which some of them are just in the movie because they were in its predecessor and it would feel weird not having them return. Still does for a good popcorn movie, but not a memorable experience as it should have been.",7

"Worth the Watch, but Needs More Room for Improvement",29 May 2015,"Age of Ultron is probably the most freshest movies we have seen in a while. Its awesome special effects, plot, and superheroes make this one truly worth the money. I was also impressed with how they added a wider variety of heroes to the roster. Ultron himself also was impressive, with his own fair share of humor in the mix.

That was probably why I liked the movie. It just didn't feel good about how quick the introduction all went and how the whole Ultron thing went. I didn't understand Ultron to be honest, I knew he was this evil robot, but I didn't get the whole origin of his AI type of thing came into place. Its a quicksilver shift to phase 3 and the humor and action doesn't mask any of it. I firmly believe that if this continues to happen in the movies, them I'm going to have to give them a 6 or 7 from now on.",7
Best of the best movie of the year 2015 ! Hope there will be part 3,22 April 2015,"First of all, marvel did it again a very nice job ! Thank you marvel ! This movie blow my mind. Even though there is quite a lot of talking, but the action and the special effect really amaze me ! Love the iron man fighting with the hulk, truly spectacular !

Very love the team spirit to fight off against the huge army enemy! Of course there is funny moments too ! There is no dull moment throughout the movie! Super exceed the part 1

I don't wish to say too much of this movie, anyway i gave this movie a big full10 out of 10 ! Hopefully there will be another sequel part 3 ! Oh and don't wait further, go watch inside the movie theater and it is worth the money !",10

Good but not GREAT!,23 April 2015,"Right, I may get some abuse for this as it seems people loved the film but probably more because they are fans rather than having an impartial head on.

I liked the 1st Avengers film and was expecting a lot from this one. I went to the midnight showing on the opening day hoping for great things... unfortunately, this film was not worth me staying up to watch. Don't get me wrong, I liked it but did it live up to expectations... NO.

I just felt that the storyline was too rushed, especially on how Ultron was created. Also there are instances where there was too much soul searching by the characters. The storyline was such a cliché and is an adaptation of other earlier movies (irobot) to mention one. There were no twists or turns. I felt like they were trying to do too much.

I did, however, like the good humor the characters have and the special effects. I do have to say, as Marvel goes, Guardians of the Galaxy was MUCH better.",7
Avengers: Age of Ultron SIMPLY SPECTACULAR,1 May 2015,"In order to accomplish this, six character must be portrayed as heroic. Six characters must have their characters and mythologies deepened. Six characters must have their inter-relationships advanced in some way. Naturally, all of this must be delicately structured into a screenplay that delivers a cohesive, compelling story interrupted by jaw- dropping action set-pieces.

On top of that, without being jokey or self-referential, ""Ultron"" delivers ten times the laughs of most Hollywood comedies. Whedon's dialog has always shined. ""Ultron"" is a creative peak. The quiet moments between the characters, especially a celebration that ends badly, are every bit as enjoyable as the action scenes. And that's saying a lot. Not for the dialog — but for the action scenes, that are almost always soul-deadening in today's cartoons, CGI spectaculars.

The worst thing that can happen in a sequel is a ""bigger is better"" mentality. Let's face it, the first ""Avengers"" was already big and already a sequel. Most of the films in the Marvel Universe also have a problem with the stakes. The stakes are always huge — the world or the galaxy or the universe or the whatever is always on the line. The problem with this approach is that you never buy into the idea the villain will succeed.",10
I know you're good people. I know you mean well. But you just didn't think it through.,2 May 2015,"The Following Review WILL NOT Contain Spoilers!

Three years after the highly successful and great Avengers film that Joss Whedon and other masterminds brought us, we get the long awaited sequel. This film doesn't have the charm and originality of the first film. It instead tries to be too much like the first movie, and fails for the most part. The film often drags along uselessly with aspects of the story that are either underdeveloped or taken too far over the top. The film has some great elements though, and I still do not consider this a bad film. The following is my review of Avengers: Age of Ultron.

The film was written by Joss Whedon who also helped write the first Avengers film. The film adds some new characters like Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver(characters we have all seen in the commercials and trailers by now). The rest of the team is already well established from the previous film, so knocking the character development on characters like Iron Man, Thor, and Captain America makes no sense. Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch both get rushed into the film with a back story that shows little emotion. The characters themselves fit well into the action around them nicely though. The movie is mainly well paced expect around the middle part of the film. Around this time we get left with the same tired moments of characters trying to connect with each other emotionally. I understand wanting this aspect of the story, but it drags on for a good twenty to thirty minutes for sure. Whedon is able to overall craft something somewhat interesting, but it feels too much like the first film. Some of the characters act too stupid as well over of the course of the film. Towards the end of the movie in the final battle this play out big time. Whedon tries something different, but it falls on its face because it misses other key aspects. Whedon can make excellent products, however this time he delivered something generally average.

Joss Whedon is the director as well, and he did direct the first Avengers film. The action scenes are one of the brightest areas of the film. We are introduce to his amazing talent right off the start in this sequel. Though there are lengthy slowdowns in the action later on in the film, and sometimes the action can be incoherent, however the action mostly flows nicely, and is very enjoyable. The ending of the film though feels too much like the first film, and this is another knock on Whedon. With some different characters it would have been nice to expand on the characters overall. That just doesn't happen. The acting is another bright spot for the most part. The only downside of the film in this aspect are the awful accents from Elizabeth Olsen(Scarlet Witch) and Aaron Taylor-Johnson(Quicksilver). Olsen outside of the awful accent delivers generally a great job of acting. Taylor-Johnson is as stale as ever in this film. Most know he isn't the best actor, and we see why yet again in this film. James Spader(Ultron) delivers a great performance voice acting in this film. Though his character is not exactly written great in the film. The rest of the Avengers are a joy to watch as they finally have a perfect chemistry after doing many of these films over the years. Whedon delivers mostly great action scenes that look nice even though they are CG, but misses the mark in key areas as well.

The film was scored by both Danny Elfman and Brian Tyler. Elfman came onto the production after Tyler has already done work on the film. Both of these composers have past experience in this genre of films. Tyler work on previous MCU films like Iron Man 3 and Thor: The Dark World, while Elfman has work on Batman(1989), Batman Returns, and more recently with Spider-Man 1 & 2. Their score here in generally okay, but nothing special. Both composers have amazing talent, but outside of a few pieces here and there, the score is lackluster. I thought for sure this would be one guaranteed great aspect of the film, but in my opinion it was just average.

In closing, Avengers: Age of Ultron is a mixed bag of emotions for me. I didn't hate the film, and liked a few aspects of the film. A few other aspects turned me off on this film though. The film is fun at times and fans of the superhero genre should watch this film right away, but I felt it was about at average, just above average at best. After the big success of the first Avengers film and how great that film was, I shouldn't have expected something on the same level. I really didn't, but in the end it fell even further than I thought it would. In the end I would still tell people to see this film at least once, even though I didn't love it.

5.5/10

I want to take a moment and talk about the IMAX version of this film. The film was not shot using IMAX or 3D cameras. Even though it was converted all the way around the 3D looks amazing as a great deal of the film is CG, and the IMAX adds some great depth that normal screens still don't have. The non CG 3D scenes aren't anything exciting though, and look bland on the screen. This isn't real 3D or real IMAX, but unless the tickets is extremely overpriced, I would say it is worth viewing on the larger scale IMAX screens.",6
This is an awesome movie,5 September 2018,This is a great movie. It has great acting.It also has a great story line. It is very fast past. It is one of the best movies ever. See it. It is a great movie. It also one of the best movies of all time.,10
Not as Might as before!,28 April 2015,"Slightly hamstrung as building block for future Marvel Cinematic universe, narrative problems and its into the unknown script. Age of Ultron represents a more action packed and more exciting sequences. But it hardly reaches the irresistible sense fun of its predecessor! While heroes are given equal amount of time and especially more screen time to hawk eye (Jeremy Renner), than last one. Age of Ulton does wins over thrilling editing, CGI and amazing Imax 3D. however this time music takes backseat! Honestly Alan Silvestri gave much better score to The Avengers (2012) than danny elfman this time. Joss Whedon does nice job by not losing the grip over ""not-so-good' script with amazingly cheoreocgraphed action! It's a great time at cinema watching, but still The Avengers (2012) remains the winner!",7
More (or less) of the same,11 May 2015,,8
Roller Coaster ride !,6 May 2015,"The Avengers 2,sure it's gonna be one of the top grossing films around the globe.The movie is equipped with lot of spectacular stunts and scenes just like the Iron-Man armor equipped with cool toys.

But still the movie lacked any kind of suspense or high adrenaline thrill.Actually the movie was quiet predictable. It's a movie you don't watch twice unlike Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy or Cameron's Terminator series.

Apart from all that,the movie is quiet a fun roller coaster ride,especially the stunt scenes between Iron Man (Hulk Buster) and Hulk, introduction of new character's such as Vision etc...

Finally, the movie is totally worth the money you pay for the ticket.",7
Slightly disappointing in some respects but awesome in others.,30 April 2015,"Two things you should know about me before we get started. 1st I love the avengers and 2nd Ultron is my favourite villain period.

That is why I am happy that this film is really fun and feels far more like an avengers film than the first as the first film, which I love by the way, did feel more like an iron man film with other superheroes turning up. This however starts off immediately (with one of the coolest scenes that I have seen in a very long time) telling you that this is an avengers film. The dialogue and chemistry between characters is great, the jokes work well and the action if you hadn't guessed was incredibly and some scenes sent my nerdiness into ultra. With that said however I would have liked if this film spent more time on its own story rather than setting up for future films most notably Infinity wars. Also I could quite clearly tell at some points that this film had been edited down from the original 3&1/2 hr cut to the 2&1/2 hr. Some scenes felt forced in and others felt like they could have offered more. And possibly my greatest gripe about the film is Ultron, not how he is portrayed you understand as James Spader does a stellar job, more so the amount of screen time he got and his introduction. It felt rushed and I had a feeling that important scenes relating to that character where cut out completely. Not to mention that they seemed to Nerf Ultron. It would have been awesome if he single handedly nearly defeated all the avengers (which he has done multiple times in the comics). He just felt like another Loki all talk but when he has an army at his back, but by himself he's not much of a threat, which as an Ultron fan myself disappointed me greatly. However I feel that this has to do with what I said earlier about the film being cut down, and personally I would rather see a 3&1/2hr movie with my favourite villain ever done right than a 2&1/2 one where he was done okish. One final minor annoyance is that quicksilver felt useless as a character and really didn't add anything to the film baring a couple of cool scenes and funny jokes. On the other hand the introduction of Scarlette witch was very welcome and she unlike her brother added a fair amount to the story as well as providing some pretty cool abilities. And speaking of cool the addition of Vision was awesome and done so well, Paul Battany portrayed him perfectly and was hands down one of the best parts of the film. Other parts that the film did well was the character moments especially Brice Banner (Hulk) and Clint Barton (Hawkeye). Hawkeye was really flushed out and the film did a great job of having him really hold the team made up of people with near godlike abilities together. And with Banner, they made him feel more present and relatable in this film than the first though I have to say the romance with black widow was a bit weird and forced. The story itself is more serious and the stakes felt much higher than the first. In summary, it felt rushed at points, I could tell it wasn't the final cut and I was very disappointed in the villain. But it was still an awesome time, with cool characters, incredible action scenes and good character moments. 8/10",8
Excellent for giving a headache.,25 April 2015,"Saw it today.. It gave me headache... 5/10... I knew most of the things which were going to happen.. So not much surprises... This movie was stretched out too much, could have been done in 1.5hrs... This just contributed to infinity war movies, as a stand alone movie it failed, Ultron was kinda lame in it. Seemed like Michael Bay movie with 95% explosions, 3% story and 2% hype for civil war and infinity war movies.. The Vision was nothing special at all, movie was centered around tony.. I liked the character of tony but not anymore now I want him dead or not a part of avengers... Joss Whedon will not direct any more avengers which seems cool after I saw this movie....",6

Can the Sequel Live Up to the Hype?,18 November 2018,,
Avengers : Age of Repetition,23 April 2015,"Avengers age of Ultron fails to deliver topping the original Avengers movie. On a positive note it is an entertaining movie blockbuster very similar to the original except the action and humour are not as sharp as the previous instalment. There is a darker tone to this film then the previous entry, but in some ways not dark enough.It is hard to explain but something just seems very disjointed this time around our main heroes never seem emotionally engaged or in any kind of real danger like I feel they should be, maybe this is down to Ultron being a Cgi character as opposed to Loki being human in the original, maybe the actors found it hard too interact with an army of Cgi robots all the time. After the great Winter Solider last year I had high hopes for the Avengers age of Ultron. I am glad that the Russo brothers will be taking over from Joss Whedon after this film, he made a great first Avengers film but should of had the foresight to create something different this time rather then make a sequel like so many other sequels that just fall flat, he has admitted having a nightmare while making this movie and I think it shows. However it will still be a financial success because of the brand. New characters Quicksilver and Scarlett Witch are welcome additions, but still fail to add any emotional depth to the film. Scarlett Witch is given better material to work with then Quicksilver. I am sure the future will still be bright for the Avengers, especially after Civil War next year. Overall maybe Marvel and Disney's first stumble so far in this series after the fabulous Winter Soldier and Guardians of the Galaxy last year.",7
Avengers: Age of Ultron,21 June 2021,,9
Manual special effects,1 May 2015,,7
Strong sequel,9 April 2023,"Avengers: Age of Ultron is an underrated film that, while not quite living up to the original Avengers movie, still manages to deliver plenty of humor and superhero action. The movie brings back our favorite heroes, including Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Black Widow, Hawkeye, and the Hulk, as they face off against a new foe - the artificial intelligence program known as Ultron.

One of the strongest aspects of this film is its continued focus on the relationships between the Avengers. We see a deeper exploration of the romantic relationship between Black Widow and the Hulk and get to see more of Hawkeye's personal life. These character moments add emotional weight to the action sequences and give the audience more reasons to care about what's happening on the screen.

The humor in the movie is well-done, with plenty of witty one-liners and comedic setpieces. Joss Whedon, who wrote and directed the film, has a talent for balancing humor with more dramatic moments, which helps keep the tone of the movie consistent.

However, the plot of the film is a bit convoluted, with lots of subplots and new characters introduced in a short amount of time. Additionally, Ultron, while an interesting and dynamic villain, doesn't quite measure up to Loki from the first Avengers movie in terms of character development and overall impact.

Despite these criticisms, Avengers: Age of Ultron is still an entertaining and enjoyable superhero movie. It's a fun ride that delivers on action, humor, and heart, and continues to explore the relationships between our favorite heroes. While it may not quite reach the heights of the original Avengers, it's still a worthy addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe.",8
Entertaining but felt like it had been directed by a committee,26 April 2015,"Whilst I enjoyed the film, it didn't feel as much like a Whedon film and more like he was maybe allowed a few minutes here and a few minutes there before he had to return to being on the path that was laid out for him.

The film had a very much tick box, direct by committee feel to it.

Make sure there are this many new characters, ram in some interaction even if it doesn't feel organic, ensure that we put in irrelevant scenes only to provide links for future films, don't stray from the plan.

The mid credits scene only re-enforced this and reminded you that the film you just watched was really nothing more than a filler.

There was masses going on and loads of new characters but it just felt that it was going at 100mph and didn't want to stop and smell the roses.

I can understand why Joss would want to step away from this for a bit and that maybe the slightly more easily manipulated Russo brothers could take the reins for A:IW 1 & 2.

They demonstrated that they can direct action scenes that fulfil the 'wouldn't it be cool if we...' but then when trapped in a story telling dead end just go with a hole in the ground get out of jail card.

The film was entertaining, there was plenty of cool tech on display and it was certainly worth the price of admission. However, I don't think (in my opinion) that it was better than the first Avengers or Guardians.",6
"Bigger, deeper, better!",28 December 2022,"Yes! I was underwhelmed when I saw Avengers, felt it to lack depth and felt too synthetic.

Ultron on the other hand has depth. The need for humans to be sure of their fate and their ever failing attempts to try and play with it.

Ultron is also much bigger, with big action sequences, more super heroes and Ultron as the villain is menacing.

The acting is top notch. The screenplay is consistent and doesn't dip. Had the exhilarating moments that I was looking for and found missing in avengers.

It is definitely underrated in the avengers franchise, it's fantastic and I would say better than it's predecessor and worthy launch for the last 2 of the avengers blockbusters.

Best marvel film yet!!,29 April 2015,,9
In many ways I like this better then the first,7 May 2015,"We need no introduction to the heroes them self, so the film starts of with a blast and jumps right into the action and the story, we get filled in on the details along the way, but some things a left unsaid and keeps possibilities open for further explanation or maybe spin-offs.

The story of this is better then the first, there is a better red line to follow, we also get some nice flashbacks or dreams that shows us more about the characters and their hopes, fears and dreams. It kind of have some more intimate relations and Black Widow really gets to shine here, both in vulnerability, secure/insecure emotions and feelings and her past brings up stuff as well, It is nice to see more of the characters, even though a love story doesn't really fit in with this crowd.

It is still just an action movie, but it is entertaining, filled with action and effects, a good story with some openings (what the f*ck happened in Budapest), humor and one liners as they should be.",7
"Clearly, comic books really DO lower people's intelligence",6 May 2015,"Please bear in mind that the person writing this is a BIG fan of Joss Whedon's earlier work in TV and movies. It's the fact that I really AM such a fan that made going to see ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" so upsetting.

I managed to sit through the whole film, but just barely. Instead of the ""Wow! Look at that!"" I was supposed to feel, all I felt was sadness that one of the best storytellers of our age had sunk so low. ""Ultron"" was 141 minutes of Biff! Zap! Pow! Boom! Zoom! CGI madness, punctuated with a few lines that clearly were intended to be funny but only could have been considered so by pimply-faced 14-year-olds whose standards for comic one-liners had been set by Beavis and Butthead.

In other words, I hated it. I wish Joss would wake up from his comic book-induced stupor and remember how to write characters and plots again. ""Buffy"" used to cost $1.1 million per episode. ""Firefly"" used to cost $2 million per episode. And they were great.

""Ultron"" cost over $2 million PER MINUTE of running time, and it's crap.

There is a lesson here. When Joss is working with his own ideas, it doesn't take huge amounts of money to create wonderful entertainment. When he is working with other people's comic book ideas, it doesn't matter how much money the producers throw at it -- it's comic book-mentality crap.

Stop making crap, Joss. Tell the guys at Marvel to keep their money and keep their mediocre plots and characters. Come back to making entertainment based on your own ideas.",2
Disappointed,20 May 2015,"The worst by far. Too much time wasted hanging around, could have been much shorter and snappier.

The storyline was a little boring and somewhat confusing and there was not enough enough original action.

Thor looked plain skinny though it was nice to see him in plain clothing. It was nice too to see something of the personal lives of one of the characters.

Too much emphasise, as always, on Tony Stark.

All in all, a big let down.

Maybe I would have enjoyed it better if I had not had someone kicking the back of my cinema seat all the way through?",

MARVEL'S MASTERPIECE!! *No Spoilers*,24 April 2015,"Joss Wheadon has perfectly managed to create yet another fantastic, amazing superhero movie. All the characters have depth unlike the previous Avengers movie and Ultron seriously kicks ass. There were moments when I was shocked, when I laughed till my cheeks hurt and there were also moments when I was in awe. The entire movie kept me hooked to my seat and you will easily immerse yourself in the movie. Avengers Age of Ultron has some of the best action scenes ever in the entire Marvel history. Those who are new to the superhero genre will also enjoy this movie with the same zeal as a Marvel fan-boy. Overall, the casting is perfect, the balance between the humor and the dark tone is perfect, action scenes were perfect, story development and direction is perfect... Is this a masterpiece? Hell Yeah!",8

Entertaining and a step up from the previous titles,23 April 2015,"The Avengers starts to become a trusted story with known characters.

The previous titles were exciting, but the hyper-active, over-the- top and ""excess of action that flashes on the screen so you can barely absorb"" took away from the experience. Chosen angles and film-techniques which remind of Transformers - which bloat scenes and give them more gravity while there is no content or added value...

This episode, however, strikes a perfect balance: the scene's are beautiful with much tense action and sublime graphics. And over the top sequences. But they are not what carries the movie: the graphics and action scenes are complimentary to the main story line and an expression of the motivations and personalities of the characters.

Each individual character gets enough airtime to feel sympathy or understand how s/he is thinking, feeling or operating in the moment. Which creates debt and traction, without being boring or being bland.

Additionaly, Tony Stark seems to have been matured. Which opens a window for his character to evolve further in a more paternal or protective role aside of the (nearly annoying) juvenile spectrum we've known him for.

In short: this is an Avenger movie where there has been attention for the details other action movies of the genre often fall too short. Well worth your time.",9
No Direction and Messy,11 September 2015,"I expected this movie to top the avengers and I have to say I'm disappointed. I'm a fan of Marvel and DC comics and I embrace the movies whenever I can... but this one didn't do it for me. Specially, being the next in line of the Avengers. 7/10 was little too generous of me - it was for the CGI and for scale of the movie.

I remember walking out of the theatre after Avengers... Felt satisfies, grand and grateful for all the efforts put in making the film specially, the wonderful story line which was well connected from the beginning to the end. Avengers made me and lot of us wanting more from Marvel. But Age of Ultron was somewhat the opposite of all of the above I have to say.

In Ultron, the story from the start to end was not well connected, kinda messy and felt sudden at times. Rather than letting the movie unwrap the story and its characters the script tried to forced things it wanted to tell the audience. Felt more like a check list. The character I enjoy the most was Ultron. The rest of the cast did a good job but I think the direction of the movie and the script didn't do much justice... The jokes were one the dull end too.

Overall, although you could still enjoy the movie for its actions and CGI, its nothing like the Avengers. Its messy... You can't help thinking that this time around Joss Whedon lose the grip somewhat. And I really hope the next one will live up for the standards of the Avengers.",7
Age of Ultron? More like Age of BOREDOM!,13 May 2015,"Bad sequel to the fantastic 2012 ""The Avengers"". Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) and Bruce Banner/Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) attempt to jumpstart a system to keep peace all over the Earth. Things go wrong and they create a being called Ultron (voiced by James Spader) who sets out to destroy all humans. It's up to the Avengers to stop them but he's helped by the Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olson) and Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor-Johnson).

This sequel is just terrible. The script is kind of vague in specifics about why Ultron hates humans and the Avengers so much. Also the dialogue here is TERRIBLE! No actor could put over the lines these people are given. So, understandably, almost all the acting is bad. Only Scarlett Johansson (as Black Widow), Mark Ruffalo and Jeremy Renner (as Hawkeye) give good performances. Worst of all the three new superheroes--Scarlet Witch, Quicksilver and The Vision--are very badly introduced and poorly used. Also the movie is far too long at almost 150 minutes and is more boring than exciting. Yes the special effects are flawless and there are a few very exciting and long action sequences but they can't save the movie. At the end the movie takes a disastrous turn and turns in a Transformers like movie! Boring and pointless with bad acting and dialogue. I give it a 5 for the effects and action.",5
One day the machines will rise and we won't know what hit us.,1 May 2015,"Avengers Age of Ultron opens with the Avengers team; Captain America, Hulk, Thor, Iron Man, Black Widow and Hawkeye all fighting their enemy Hydra in a country known as Sokovia. Hydra have been using a Loki's staff from Thor's home world Asgard to help aid in creating the ultimate weapon. The Avengers smash Hydra's plan and take back the staff. (This is all before the actual credits). Back in Stark's lab Tony and Bruce discover a curiosity within the staff. Tony has ideas of how it can be used and goes about reprogramming the mechanics. The plan backfires, suddenly The Avengers find themselves in a race to save not only themselves but the entire planet from being completely obliterated. Written and Directed by Joss Whedon after the success of the first film I think I wasn't the only person expecting big things from the man, it seems as though he has attempted to please everyone possible with this film, there is so many ""Easter Eggs"" throughout it's very hard not to feel overwhelmed by it all. One thing he has done very well though this time around is the screen time given to each Avenger, I can recall in the first film Hawkeye especially wasn't given much time at all and almost seemed an extra, Joss has definitely made up, including back story and an even bigger surprise when it comes to Hawkeye and who he is when not firing arrows from an endless quiver, as with Thor who has suddenly become a bit of a comedian making him appear a lot less Godlike which I personally think is a great thing. And Hulk has been totally humanised by being given a romance as well as become very emotional and not just as Bruce Banner. I loved what Joss created with the characters this time around and feel it is all definitely beneficial to the franchise and everything that will come after and has come before. My absolute favourite thing though was the introduction of a very special character from the Marvel Universe, when that moment happened on screen my heart suddenly got a lot faster and my body tingled with total and utter joy. Unfortunately though what was done with that character was woeful and so pointless, I would have personally preferred they saved the unveiling for another film or franchise completely and made it all worthwhile and exciting rather than letting the unveiling be so unfulfilling and wasted. Once again the CGI like in a lot of film recently let me down, especially the opening battle scenes, the entire thing was a CGI mess,it looked fake and unrealistic, the way the characters moved turned my entire expectation on its head very early as I was absolutely disgusted with how fake it all looked, however once the opening credits rolled through the CGI suddenly picked up again and things became a little less messy. My other little gripe would be how much was stuffed into the film, new character should be exciting and rewarding but within this film they felt flat and unengaging. Joss put so much energy into creating his heroes by humanising them but left his villains and other new characters quite lifeless, I just didn't care for them at all, sure there was the sad story of childhood but that was it, it needed more, perhaps a flash back or something, as for Ultron, again I found him completely worthless and so unnecessary his plot to destroy the world was childish it needed a lot more depth to it, we as viewers need to understand why, especially when it comes to ""the villains"" why are they the way they are and why do they want to do the evil they conceive,what makes them turn from being you and I to a super-villain? Just being told isn't enough I want more, more story, more depth, more plot to make it at least somewhat engaging and enthralling. So does the Avengers Age of Ultron meet up to the same standard of its predecessor I honestly can't say yet, believe it or not it's been a week since I saw the film and it is still playing on my mind, I find myself in conversations about the film constantly just trying to find where it sits for me. There is a lot of clever lines and hidden gems it is definitely worth seeing; although I saw it in 2D I have been told that in 3D the CGI isn't as apparent so nowhere near as nasty. It should be noted; Being a PG film it's absolutely for the entire family I just think some scenes that are a little slower where Joss humanises everyone may get a little dull for those younger in age. I have left a lot out of this review to not give away spoilers but there is so much more to see I would absolutely recommend seeing this on the big screen rather than waiting for DVD release. Besides not seeing in the cinema means you'll miss out on the biggest Egg of all during the final credits, and that's not one you want to miss!!!",7
Good,18 January 2016,"This film was good I was a fan of the marvel cinematic universe I enjoyed every movie of marvel cinematic universe except for Thor the dark world , captain America the first avenger and iron man ( they were forgettable)

Now we have age of ultron well is it good you bet it's fantastic I enjoyed it more like the 1th one.

Now the effects of this amazing brilliant movie is that this movie is incredible every fight scene in it is awesome and the new hulk buster suit it's incredible oh yeah.

Now this movie is not in the cinema anymore so I recommend you check out the film in DVD because it's worth watching keep it real.",8

"Amazingly Excellent, and better than the first.",25 April 2015,"I walked out of the cinema, happy with the fact the my high expectations of this film were met. The humour was just as brilliant as the first, and the acting was, as expected, amazingly excellent. I saw this movie as more psychological than the first, as it went into the characters backgrounds with more depth, while we're also shown how the characters had to deal with their own struggles . The only thing I thought could have been added to the movie, was the character 'Pepper', as she was mentioned a few times. Overall, I would definitely suggest that everyone sees this movie, as it provides more than what you would expect from such a big franchise.",10
Liked it more than the first one. Doesn't mean it's better though.,26 April 2015,,6
"If you liked the first one, then...",2 May 2015,,8
Lacks Emotional Drive,8 May 2015,"I was honestly disappointed by this movie. It felt like a mediocre filler-in and it utterly lacked taste and the emotional picture and innate development present in the first Iron ""Men"", where Tony was captured for so long in a cave and came back a changed man; in the first Captain America, which took us back in time to the late 1930s and early 1940s and something was lost (love) that could never again be regained due to the time parting them; and in Guardians of the Galaxy, with the death of the mother and the intrigue of who's his father.

This movie (and so it seems from the trailer of Ant Man) was emotionally devoid, though with mediocre to good jokes (the hammer lifting-thing). What I and hopefully many other fans seem to be hoping for is something deeper than hour-long suspense, empty talk of freedom, and protection of Earth - for what is there to protect if nobody feels? What is there to be screaming about if the spark is missing? We need something where the people of the Earth are no longer the innocent and helpless children waiting to be saved by the Avengers as now portrayed, but grassroots, which aid one another and the Avengers by cooperation. We need that silent shot of the ravaging nature of war and destruction; and the deafening picture of the mother sacrificing her life for her child. There's no saving everyone, and it's about time that Marvel and the Avengers learn this cruel fact of life because in turn this movie franchise will turn into a mere farce.

Sure, it's a superhero movie, but it lacks the subtlety, reality and naturalness that evoke the truly good movies (Finding Nemo is a great example).",6
Avengers Age of Ultron - 2015 Great Movie To Watch,2 May 2015,"I loved what they did with The Vision and how they did it. The Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver — aka, Pietro and Wanda Maximoff are amazing as well. Wanda's psychic powers are much more complicated and empathetic then I expected them to be. What I love about Wanda is that she physically goes through emotional trauma when she uses certain powers and we as the audience go with her on that emotional journey. Like just about everything this film, that really packs a punch.

There are good, fun moments spread all through the movie, don't get me wrong I liked plenty of stuff in it. The romance between Hulk and Black Widow was interesting, this universe has been weirdly sexless so it was nice to see some tension between the characters. But good moments don't make a good movie. What annoyed me in Age of Ultron was how it just glossed over so many things. The story is extremely thin, even for a superhero movie.",10
A nice looking popcorn mess,12 September 2015,"Greetings from Lithuania.

Can someone please explain to me what was all the buzz for ""Avengers: Age of Ultron""? This movie holds an 7,8 rating at IMDb but is barely 7/10 movie at all. This is a nice looking, turn off your brain popcorn mess - that is it - nothing more. Dialogs were written for 13-16 years old audiences - ""Watch you language""!, really? Although there are some nice comedic scenes, this movie takes itself way to much serious, but it so absurd that i didn't care what was going on, where, who, how and etc. - one sure shouldn't be thinking about movies plot when watching ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"".

Special effects were good, but this is no surprise - they have to look great, because there wouldn't be much to watch at all in here if they weren't good. Acting is OK for this stuff - they all just put the mask of ""oh I'm in the Marvel movie"" and made their way through the movie. Why did Elizabeth Olsen even tried with the fake accent? No one cared for her accent in this mess. James Spader did a good job in voicing the main villain, but watching this kinda kids movie you know villain is doomed from the moment he appears on screen - you won't win if you are a villain in a Marvel movie! Overall, if you are 14 years old and a fan boy of comics on which this mess is based on - you will like this (probably). If you are not 14 years old and aren't comic book fan - you can skip this one, it is just a messy eye candy with beer and popcorn.",7

"Enjoyable, but too much clutter",11 August 2015,"3 years after the original blockbuster, we rejoin our colorful heroes with new additions to the team roster as they group together to take down one of Tony Stark's robots that becomes self-aware and tries to destroy the world. Let's just get this out of the way, no, it's not as good as the first Avengers, there are a few too many story threads that are crow barred into the narrative solely for setting up future films. I understand it's necessary to have all this to set up Captain America: Civil War, Thor: Ragnarok and so on, but these sub plots detract from what should have just been an enjoyable, straight-forward evil robot becomes self-aware story. Having said that, James Spader is fantastic as Ultron, the action scenes are energetic and fun (The highlight is the Hulkbuster fight). A little too much going on, but it was still a very enjoyable blockbuster comic book movie.",6
really enjoyable,23 April 2015,,8
"Good, but lacking in many ways",11 May 2015,"First off, this movie is not a bad movie in any way. It is action packed and enjoyable from beginning to end. But with that being said I felt this movie was underwhelming in many ways. In phase one Marvel does a successful job of connecting all of the movies together, ending with the conclusion with The Avengers. I felt phase 2 did a good job of showing what the characters did in the events immediately following the events in New York during Avengers 1.

But this time around I personally felt like Marvel did a sub-par job of connecting the films. They also failed to mention a lot of the cliffhangers that the other movies have previously led the fans on. For example, why is Thor on Earth? Why are the chitauri still around? And how did they find Hydra, which seemed so deeply hidden in previous films. They act as though Tony Stark never destroyed is suites at the end of Iron Man 3, and they only mention Bucky Barnes one time, and it's just a brief sentence. I also wasn't a huge fan of the romance between two of the main characters, just feel that it was set up well enough, and felt like it was added just to have a love interest in the movie.

I just felt that the story was a little disconnected from previous films and the story of Ultron was completely rushed. It did have the marvel humor that fans have grown to expect, although I would argue this film focused a little more on the comedy side, rather than the dark story that could have been. The fighting sequences are awesome, and Ultron is an awesome character as well. Overall this is a good popcorn film, but Marvel has been so good lately that this movie feels a little bit like a disappointment. I was also disappointed that there wasn't a post credit scene setting up the next film, the post credit scenes have been lacking of late, which is also a disappointment to me. I give it a 7/10, which is still a good movie, but it could have been much better. Hopefully they do better in phase 3.",7
Im seeing this again,30 April 2015,,8
Good news & bad news.,5 May 2015,"The good news is that Joss Whedon's dialogue is just as witty as ever. His characters sparkle with wit and it's fun just sitting there and watching the Avenger's have a good time. Their good time is infectious. The bad news is that there is so many of them. James Spader's Ultron is charismatic and very powerful is another piece of good news, his Minions are not as much fun as Gru's from 'Despicable Me' though. And if like me you find yourself folding your hand bag strap as small as you can and then counting the loops, well think of all those poor boys in the audience who don't even have a handbag strap to fold. I was rather disappointed to tell the truth.

The direction is good, the acting is good, the action is getting very old hat by now. The 3D, well what can you say. I didn't notice anything great about it. When all you are noticing in a film is the fact that Thor's hair could really use a good shampoo and blow dry, the story isn't really holding your attention.",7
"It's definitely a mixed bag, but mostly entertaining and satisfying.",6 May 2015,"'AVENGERS: AGE OF ULTRON': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)

Sequel to the 2012 blockbuster superhero flick 'THE AVENGERS'; and the 11th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Joss Whedon returned to write and direct this installment (as he did the first) and most of the cast reprises their roles; including Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Samuel L. Jackson, Paul Bettany and Cobie Smulders. Don Cheadle, Anthony Mackie, Idris Elba, Hayley Atwell and others also reprise their parts from other Marvel films; while James Spader, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Elizabeth Olsen and Linda Cardellini join the cast. This time around the mighty superhero team must battle an artificial intelligence unit, created by Tony Stark and Bruce Banner, that's bent on revenge; against all of humanity. I found the film to be entertaining, and it's sure to satisfy most comic book fans, but it's definitely a mixed bag.

The story revolves around an A.I. named Ultron (Spader), who comes to life as part of Tony Stark's (Downey Jr.) defense program. Ultron is bent on destroying humanity, instead of protecting it, and enlists the help of two genetically altered twins (Taylor-Johnson and Olsen). He also builds an army of deadly robots, to serve as his army. It's up to the Avengers to stop Ultron and once again save the world.

The movie is all over the place; there's a lot of characters and most of them are pretty underdeveloped. We do get to learn more about Hawkeye (Renner) and Black Widow (Johansson), the two Avengers who haven't had their own movies yet, but the rest of the principal players don't have engaging story lines. Thor (Hemsworth) serves as great comic relief; but Stark's one-liners are getting very tired and poorly written. There's also some pretty badly done melodrama (throughout the movie) and an oddly placed romance between Hulk (Ruffalo) and Black Widow (What happened to Betty Ross?!). It's also never explained why Tony Stark came out of retirement and has several suits of armor again (after destroying them all in 'IRON MAN 3'). The action scenes go on for way too long (and are pretty reminiscent of 'MAN OF STEEL', or a Michael Bay 'TRANSFORMERS' film). It does have plenty of good moments too, though, and most die-hard fans will still love it; for all the geeky comic crap it does stay true to. It's just not the most well developed, or balanced, movie (as a result). The first film and some other installments, in the Marvel Universe, are better; but this film is definitely still an entertaining and mostly satisfying addition!

"Enjoyable and fun, but not really life-changing or original.",8 December 2015,"I liked this movie better than the first Avengers film. The topic of singularity makes the story more interesting than the first one. The action was very fast and well done, it kept the movie upbeat and thrilling. Yet the action still overshadows the story way too much, there isn't enough time left for any character development (but still more character development than in the first movie). After all the Marvel movies i've watched i still don't feel like I really know the characters as well as I should. Out of all the Avengers i think i enjoy Thor the most, because Chris Hemsworth looks like a God, he looks royal, best casting ever.

I thought 'Avengers: Age Of Ultron' was enjoyable and fun, but not really life-changing or original. Maybe i'm just not enough of an action fan to be in love with the Avengers movies.",6

impressive piece of (CGI) crap,30 August 2015,"a while back ago, action movies used to be simple, there's an obviously bad guy and obviously good guy who's gonna stop him from doing his evil deed. You went to watch action movies to relax your head, that's the reason they were called no-brainers. And here, I don't even know who's who, and who's what, and who's with (or against) who ... I mean, there are waaay too many characters. Also way too much action and too much talk. To sum it all - way too much information. Who (or what) is this Ultron thing? Should I ask them to pause movie in cinema so I could google it up? And if I got his plan right, his goal is to save humanity by destroying Earth? Really? Similar questions for a Paul Bettany's character. Wth is he supposed to be? And, yes I know it's adaptation of comic so I'm not gonna whine about logic (for example who's manufacturing all those mean robots, who I assume are all Ultron at the same time) but ffs ... could anyone start filming again those simple, easy understandable action movies?",1
Age of continuation,11 May 2015,"""I know you're good people. I know you mean well. But you just didn't think it through. There is only one path to peace... your extinction.""

Age of Ultron doesn't live up to the first Avengers mostly because the novelty of seeing all these superheroes together has warn off, but it is still a very entertaining film with some positive elements to take out of it. First of all, the villain voiced by James Spader is an improvement over most others we've seen in the Marvel Universe. He is actually a menace to the heroes, and although Ultron isn't as charismatic as Loki, he still represents a much more dangerous threat for them so we feel there is much more at stake. The addition of Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch also enhances the franchise. Olsen is an actress I've admired ever since her screen debut in Martha Marcy May Marlene, so it was exciting to see her play this role alongside other fantastic actors. Aaron Taylor-Johnson's Quicksilver wasn't used as well as he was in X-Men, but it was still fun to see him on screen. Quicksilver was the highlight for me in the latest X-Men franchise, but here he is simply another new character. It was much more fun to see his quick movements in slow motion instead of at such a rapid pace. The returning characters also enhance the sequel and make it entertaining. Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man is by far my favorite character in the franchise and Mark Ruffalo's Hulk always delivers some of the best comedic moments. Age of Ultron delivers plenty of fun scenes, but it also tries to take itself a bit more seriously, and that didn't work as well for me considering I found Captain America The Winter Soldier to be a slightly better and interesting serious thriller. In summary, it doesn't match the comedy of its predecessor and it doesn't stand out as a more serious film either. The run-time does begin to feel a bit heavy, but I still have to admit that I had a fun time with the movie. There is a lot going on and with the addition of the new characters some of the scenes feel rushed and the plot gets a bit convoluted.

The main problem with these Marvel movies is that they're getting more and more difficult to view as individual films. They seem to be always building up to something and I expected all the build-up in the previous films was going to lead to something important in this second Avengers movie, but what we get instead is more of a build-up to the next phase of the Marvel universe. Ultron presented a great threat to the heroes, but everything was rushed and it seems it was resolved all too easily by the end. It's still hard to resist a film with so many likable characters and charismatic leads, but I couldn't help but feel a bit disappointed with Age of Ultron when the introduction of the main villain seemed promising. Spader's voice work stood out for me in this film as one of the best performances. I was also happy to see Jeremy Renner get much more screen time with his character, Hawkeye, as well as Scarlett Johansson with Black Widow. This is probably as close to an individual film about them we'll get. Captain America and Thor however, are underused and I really didn't care too much about them here.

Marvel-ous!,25 April 2015,"Where to begin... Age of Ultron is a very good film. The movie was interesting and well acted all the way through. Some of the scenes in the film look so good and feel like they have literally crawled off the pages of the comic books the film was created from. Ultron, the evil protagonist, of the film, certainly stole the stage every time he was on. James Spader's distinctive voice also brought Ultron to life. Whilst watching the film, I kept thinking are there too many characters? But, by the end, I felt like everything fitted together so well and worked very nicely. As for my favourite scenes, I must mention the fantastic Hulk buster vs Hulk scene which was something I have wanted on the big screen since the beginning of the Marvel cinematic universe. Another scene that has to be noted is the final scene which is a truly incredible big screen event. Overall, I give this film an 8/10 because it is really a game changing film. I recommend this movie to comic fans and general movie goers alike. If you want to see an all round good film watch Avengers: Age of Ultron!",8
"Good Villain, Good Sequel, Good Movie... but not perfect.",7 May 2015,"Alright coming into this movie after reading the countless user reviews I had doubts, but I'll tell you first hand. All of those doubts were shattered six ways over. We'll start with the directing. Directing: Holy hell, does this movie look good, and better than its predecessor. If it's amazing group shots with awesome camera work, or just the dialogue scenes. After seeing the first two trailers, I thought the color tone looked really dull. It's not. The colors are bright where they need to be, and dark when they need to be. Acting: Standard Acting (which is a high standard coming from Marvel) Everyone is great in their roles. Leaves nothing to be desired. Writing: Near flawless witty dialogue, with only a few jokes that don't stick. VERY FEW. This movie can get very dark at times in terms of writing. Especially when they decide to dive into the origins. More on that later. Score: I nice subtle score, not to crazy, not to quiet. Leaves a bit to be desired. (Since this movie is primarily character driven I'll put a section for the characters) Characters: Origins Explored,and Developments Made. Hawkeyes gets the most development out of the group. Mostly because he had little to none in the first. Black widow has two different interesting story lines in this movie. 1: Her dark origin 2: her growing relationship towards Bruce. The hulk is the same as last time but still decent. Same can be said for cap. Ironman's storyline is quite similar to IronMan 3. Thor is basically his same old good self. The twins (Scarlet Witch, and Quicksilver) are really likable and surprisingly HUMAN. Ultron... okay I'll just go ahead and say it. He's the best villain since Heath Ledger's joker. He's Charismatic, funny and at the same time, Uncomfortably menacing. Props to James Spader. There is one character that I haven't mentioned but I'll let you have fun with that Verdict: By all means A Good Sequel, not perfect but good. It improves on the weaknesses,and strengthens the good parts of the original. Not to mention successfully and smoothly introducing 4 different likable characters. Although plot lines are rushed at times, and characters sometimes need more/less development I still give it a 7/10",7
Avengers: Age of Ultron was another awesome epic from Marvel Studios!,5 May 2015,"Joss Whedon and Marvel Studios have done it again! That is, they made an awesome Avengers movie full of great action, good humor, and nice dramatics concerning characterization. Whedon, previously creator of such classic TV shows like Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Angel, and Firefly, is such an expert of mixing genres that it's easy to take him for granted now but he still has some surprises in how he still puts it all together. Like the fate of one of the superhero characters, for instance. It's so awesome seeing Captain America, Iron Man, Thor, Hawkeye, The Hulk, and the Black Widow fighting side-by-side once again saving the world! Oh, and yes, Stan Lee does another of his awesome cameos saying something he's famous for this time! So on that note, I definitely recommend Avengers: Age of Ultron!",9
Mostly good movie,3 May 2015,,7
"More of the same, which is why it works.",5 May 2015,"8.5/10 – Reviewed by Matthew French

Making a sequel to a movie that was, not only the third highest grossing of all time, but an ensemble of other movies successful in their own right, is a challenge akin to piggy backing your Nepalese sherpa up Everest the week after conquering Kilimanjaro.

Thankfully director, and Galactic lord of geeks, Joss Whedon has delivered in a big way. No, it's not a perfect movie, and yes, you can absolutely pick fault with it. But, if you are looking for more of the same that you got from The Avengers: epic, sweeping action scenes and snappy, witty dialogue you will walk out of the theatre more than satisfied.

The same things that worked for Whedon's original big screen triumph are back again with some significant improvements. The action sequences are incredible. From the opening scene where our mighty heroes are storming a Hydra base to reclaim Loki's sceptre (and one of the all important infinity stones) the big bangs and bright colours are enough to trigger a thousand epileptic fits.

The dialogue is even better than what we've become used to in Marvel films. This movie is significantly funnier than most comedies I have seen in recent years. It is worth the price of admission for the party scene in Stark Tower alone. Seriously, that scene is five minutes of chuckle, after laugh, after giggle, after titter.

The good guys are great with the cast all in scintillating form. Robert Downey Jris, as usual, at his snappy charming best as Iron Man. His highlight reel is significantly more than just the much anticipated 'Hulk Buster suit' fight scene, although that is exquisite enough to ensure this movie becomes an instant classic on its own.

Chris Hemsworth is in just about career best form. Which is great if you're a hard core Thor fan boy, like me. In an unexpected turn of events the golden locked Asgardian is responsible for possibly more LOL's than any of his comedically astute team mates.

Hulk and Captain America are as entertaining as always, Hawkeye is leagues from the 'boring Avenger' he was previously known as, and the Maximoff twins (better known as Quiksilver and Scarlett Witch) are an excellent addition. Without doubt, though, the award for best newcomer goes to 'The Vision' played by the always amazing Paul Bettany. I won't go into detail regarding Vision's awesomeness but rest assured he almost steals the show.

The only let down is the under developed villain. The menacing, yet witty creation of Tony Stark comes into being so fast and with so little explanation that it's hard to comprehend his motives or purpose. The movie would perhaps be more aptly named 'Avengers: weekend of Ultron'.

Still, this is of little consequence. We all know that an Avengers movie is like an all-star Football team. We don't care who the opposition is, we care only that our team kicks some serious butt.

The Marvel cinematic universe has kicked another goal here. Odin knows how the hell I'm going to be able to wait for Avengers: Infinity War.

Lower your expectations,26 April 2015,"First of all let's break down the positives. 10/10 for visuals and sound.It looked good, great at times, sounded well as well.It the most action packed movie to this date!Seriously !And this is action done right!So,it is totally worth the watch.It was funny,the humor was clever,and it had the Marvel magic.AWESOME!

Now to the negatives ! Yeah,there are a few that will not go unnoticed.And it is better to be prepared for it before going into it.And all the flaws, which I won't be discussing since this is spoiler free,are due to the problem with the pacing.The movie jumps right into the action and there is no build up to it or anything, we are just jumping into what is going on.And from there the movie just rushes! It is fast paced,there is no slow build up or anything.The movie doesn't take it's time to show us everything.This was too much about the action,comedy and more action.Now it almost reached the line of being a bloated mess,but it backs away just in time.I think this movie is too short. And there was not enough Ultron in it.Ultron is awesome whenever he's on screen, but he ain't it for long enough.So, don't think he's going to be the core of this movie.And that part in the trailer where we saw captain's shield torn was only a dream sequence.It was not the result of the battle with Ultron. This movie needs to learn a few things from Watchmen in terms of pace. It should have been longer.It should have taken it's time to develop the plot properly.

In short, LOWER YOUR EXPECTATIONS.",7
Great after-party!,22 April 2015,"The film was an amazing follow-up to not only The Avengers but all the films in-between, and introduces several new characters so well! Definitely one of the best action/superhero movies in a while. Writer and director Joss Whedon only impresses in this sequel. My only downside is that there is only one very short mid-credits scene and no after-credits one. Like I said though, very good!

Of course I won't give even the little things away, this should be experienced with as little fore-knowledge as possible, like most films, but believe me, you will regret it if you know some of the twists in here, they're great to experience in the theatre.",8
"Boring, Mindless Action",29 March 2020,"This movie disappointed even some diehard Marvel fans. I could not even remember the character names. The action was boring, the character development was nonexistent, and the faceless CGI army was unintimidating.",
"Not bad, but not great. Underwhelming.",30 April 2015,"Thus is the issue with these kinds of movies. How do you top the last one? This movie seemed like a giant ""meh"" for me. The pacing was strange, the plot was strange, the humour was strange.. A lot of strange. There were many moments that lost me as a viewer, I found myself daydreaming. Not all cons, however. This movie isn't all that bad, really. Its a good entertaining flick that the family will love, with amazing visuals, amazing action sequences and still a decent plot. I just found it to be grossly underwhelming. Not one of Marvel's best, and comparable to Iron Man 2 & 3. It will destroy box office records at first, but I think we will see it quickly trail off. But you know, maybe I'm being too cynical. If you would have told me even 10 years ago we'd have a complete Marvel cinematic universe, including an Avengers 2 by 2015, I would have laughed in your face. So enjoy it while it lasts, regardless.",6
Don't expect too much and you won't be disappointed,22 April 2015,"Joss Whedon's writing is decent, but if something bothers me, it's the cheap jokes. They are used constantly, and they just are so cheesy and almost forced. Most of the audience loved them though, so maybe that works to some kind of audience.

The structure of the plot was very similar to the first Avengers, though that isn't a surprise. I don't think anyone is expecting a complicated, mind-blowing plot. The story is simple, it's decent. The fight scenes seemed much clearer this time, it was a lot easier to see what was happening and where, and who was involved. I don't know if it was just due to cinematography or effects, or the fact that I was watching a 2D version.

I was kind of hoping more from Ultron. I wanted a character who was actually scary, a villain you couldn't defend. Well, you probably can't really defend Ultron, except for the obvious – him being a robot. But he still seemed too likable. He was kind of too humane, almost funny. James Spader was wonderful though, and his voice alone was enough to make Ultron scary when needed.

The movie had its funny moments, exciting moments, pseudo-deep moments, and the weirdly surprising moments. But why did they need to add romance? It seemed sort of forced.

In short, Avengers Age of Ultron is decent, so don't get your expectations high. But it is worth seeing, otherwise it's hard to keep up with the world in these movies.",3
not as bad as iron man 3 but still average,1 May 2015,"SPOILERFREE Review-since this is a spoiler free review,i will make it as short as possible.this let me first start off by saying that this film is NOT dark or gritty as the trailers suggest.if you have high expectations,then you will be disappointed.this is just an average CGI Hollywood flick,thats all.the characters are not at all developed and they just act as plot devices and 1 dimensional.frankly speaking,there was just 1 or 2 jokes that were actually good.rest of them were just rushed.pacing was just awful.everything seems to be too rushed.i am not saying this was a bad film.it was just OK.nothing exciting or made me go ""WOW"" like first avengers.this is just a plain CGI fest.thats all.so lower your expectations and go.",6
3 Reasons that make it the perfect Superhero Movie!!,8 May 2015,"Being an avid comic-book & movie fan I had high expectations for this movie. Having read the reviews, I was not sure if this sequel was worth watching as I had already booked my ticket a day before. The movie started and then-BOOM!! Every moment in the movie was worth the money. I don't regret a second of the movie.

Some people don't realize that you don't get the same type of theme twice. Those who gave bad reviews were obviously hoping for the same theme and scenario as The Avengers. Joss Whedon stated that this movie would be much different from the prequel. The movie just creates the atmosphere that I wish to see in a superhero movie. 1. THE HEROES KICK SOME REAL ASS

Unlike it's prequel, Age of Ultron brings action sequences that are just awesome. True to the character's power,it allows him to upgrade as per the situation demands, which was seen in case of Hawkeye. That Bot-ass kicking action bestows pleasure to the eyes while gulping soda and grinding the popcorn.The extreme raving, outrageous,epic gripping of protection confined to the cause of serving humanity leaves you spellbound.

2. THE PERFECT ANTAGONIST

Ultron makes Loki look like a bunny. Everything starting from his intelligence to his voice makes a bad ass villain. I mean come on, he gave the Avengers a pretty hard time. He served under his will, made an entire army of Ultron-bots, stayed true to his wish of destroying humanity & was nearly indestructible. What more see can you ask?

3.THE STORY-TELLING

Right from the beginning till the end, there was a charismatic flow in the story. Whedon brings his magic to the big screen again with this sequel. None of the characters were ignored & they got a perfect screen-timing. I remained glued to my seat even in the interval. The sense of the story just doesn't let you quit, just like an awesome comic book. Respect.

THE AVENGERS:AGE OF ULTRON = Totally re-watchable (Upto a Million Times) + BEST Superhero Movie till date (Yes,better than THE DARK KNIGHT).",10
There was so much not there...,23 April 2015,,7
Not without flaw,10 May 2015,"If you're asking whether or not you should see this movie, the answer depends on a couple factors. If you're already in the thick of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), then definitely. If you're a fan of the comics but have yet to indulge in any of the cinematic presentations, sure. If you're unfamiliar with the comics or the previous movies, possibly not - mostly because the movie makes it very clear that a majority of the characters involved are well established.

AoU's three biggest flaws - in my opinion - are lack of accessibility for newbies, lack of character development (particularly for the new additions), and a clear choice of style over substance. However, there is still plenty of heart, quotes galore, great humor, and tantalizing visuals. So, if you're familiar with the MCU, this movie is definitely worth the cost of admission.

And Hulk versus Hulk Buster.",8
Very hollow and muddy,16 May 2015,,6
"Faults aside, Avengers: Age of Ultron progresses the MCU series further with its impeccable cast and a worthy foe.",26 April 2015,"Summer 2015 kicks off with the annual Marvel tentpole, now in the form of the summer's most anticipated Avengers: Age of Ultron. It has been a roaring success for Marvel as they kicked off their ""cinematic universe"" with the release of 2008's Iron Man. And ever since its release, Marvel followed it up with outstanding follow-ups (Iron Man 3), successful stand-alones (Captain America: The Winter Soldier), a space opera (Guardians of the Galaxy), small-screen extensions (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.) and, of course, a kick-ass crossover (Marvel's The Avengers) that breaks barriers in the superhero genre.

Now, it comes to this point if its follow-up can live up the standards of the original.

Plot-wise, the movie begins where The Winter Soldier left off as the Avengers raid HYDRA's secret base to retrieve Loki's scepter. As Iron Man/Tony Stark discovers an artificial intelligence concealed inside the scepter, he and Bruce Banner/Hulk extracts it, then, when left, possesses an Iron Man armor and forms into the entity known as Ultron. With Ultron programmed to achieve peace by eradicating humanity, the Avengers must put behind their differences and stop the invulnerable foe.

At this point on, this is where The Avengers plot line takes a new direction on progressing the series, for better or worse. But its mitigated flaws are salvaged by the most important element of Marvel's crossover, its cast and characters.

What made the first Avengers worked is its touch on built-up characters and have their arcs intertwine with others. Director Joss Whedon, whom I consider as the master of ""team dynamics"", still blends the best he could to make this superhero team a team. And the team cast really packs the best.

Still, the main leads Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark/Iron Man, Chris Hemwsorth as Thor, Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner/Hulk and Chris Evans as Steve Rogers/Captain America gave undeniable charm on their characters. Scarlett Johansson as Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow and Jeremy Renner as Clint Barton /Hawkeye provided more development at this stage. Add-ins Aaron Taylor-Johnson as Pietro Maximoff/Quicksilver and Elizabeth Olsen as Wanda Maximoff/Scarlet Witch were very welcome. And supporting players from previous MCU movies, including Don Cheadle as James Rhodes/War Machine and Anthony Mackie as Sam Wilson/Falcon, intersected with little but well-meshed parts.

But the best performances came from the A.I. characters. The main antagonist Ultron, played by a conniving James Spader, was a huge treat to watch. The character did not feel anything resembling a robot bad guy, just a Machiavellian victim. Another treat to watch is the new Avenger Vision, played by Paul Bettany. His character here is a calm presence to the withering superhero team, and a fine addition of cool- looking characters.

Overall, the cast were able to top the original on their team chemistry, since a lot of development must be pushed from there. And the story and script was able to mesh their arcs in a right amount of balance.

But what good the story and script provided does not always work for its execution. Aesthetic-wise, Age of Ultron had little to complain but it never tops the original's. The action pieces were a so-so. The sequences were commendable for having an edge-to-the-seat scale. The slo-mo was used to awesome effect. And the whole thing was never tiresome.

However, the aesthetics were not without its fault. The editing was slightly shoddy and abrupt. The camera-work almost landed on Michael Bay level with its frantic execution. The special effects were kind of blatant, especially on the Hulk. And the color palette was a bit dim; I kind of expected that to happen since the MCU series has to progress to a darker stage, but for a fun crossover, it needs to be brighter.

Out of all this, I can say that there is a little to complain about the sequel. It is just its existence makes it feel standard and obligatory, like we know what we are getting. For that, it rightfully falls short from what the predecessor provided and took a new direction, for the better.

Fortunately, fans and viewers alike will forgive this, for the Marvel superhero universe expands further with this movie. Throughout, there may not be that much Easter eggs, but there are sights of foreshadowing taking place in its sequences (remember the country Wakanda, or Hawkeye's near-to-death gags). And note, there is indeed an awesome post-credits scene.

With this, you can be able to guess that the forces of Marvel and Joss Whedon was able to craft another awesome superhero crossover adventure. Avengers: Age of Ultron achieved what it intended to achieve. It was an awesome follow-up to the hit predecessor, placing stakes high, molding a script and having it blended to the still exciting bunch of cast and characters, and punctuating them with breathtaking action sequences, wielded by an awesome villain.

However, it felt out of ambition that it falls to the pit of ""obligatory"" and ""overstretched"". From style and substance, there are truly faults that surfaced but it was salvaged by Whedon's buoyancy for the superhero team. As the opening blockbuster for the summer, it really boosted a lot of confidence, not just for Marvel but, for the upcoming summer.",8
Honest Review,30 April 2015,,7
"Awesome movie by Joss Whedon as expected, you must watch it, if you don't you are not an avenger! so go step out of the door and hit the theatre!",24 April 2015,,8
Movie Tries to Hard,19 May 2015,"Overall an okay flick. I wouldn't mind watching it a couple more times in the future. But already, I feel that this one will be the one everyone dreads to watch when doing a Marvel marathon.

Differences between the Avengers becomes exploited when the Avengers finally destroy Hydra's headquarters and face off these two new characters that have joined the series. I actually thought it was too bad that Hydra got exterminated so quickly, I felt that Hydra always provided a great plot for the marvel heroes. Oh well. As such, Mr. Stark designs his and the world's doom by creating what is in his mind the ultimate defense for the world. Ultron, brings this ""Terminator"" series idea back in where technology fights its own designers. So alright, we have this concept brought back up. Its not terrible, and I guess its an alright attempt to make the Ultron plot. It really should have been assumed way before watching what the plot was going to be, given the main villain was going to be a robot. With the Avengers being manipulated and harassed by these new mutant marvel characters, they must find the courage to hold hands and fight together... should I go on? Kind of lame. It frankly felt like a waste of time to be honest. The actual Ultron character was pretty cool. Perhaps the coolest character in the movie, which is too bad because I'm a Thorn, Captain America fan. But wow! What a wimpy conflict to throw at the characters. They seriously go through an Emo phase for about an hour because Scarlet casts a spell on them. And then of course, they just had to add the Hulk getting mad at something stupid and waste a bunch of other time. The film tries to be emotional and build attachment... but it tries way too hard.

I think what bothered me the most about the movie is that I see a concept within the Marvel/Avenger series to create heroes that are completely perfect. Captain America, you see how he questions the tactics in which SHIELD gets its information and to what extent it goes to securing the people. You see it pushed here a little where literally an entire city is ripped from the earth and dropped back to the planet. Well, the movie makes it positively clear that the Avengers rescued every single civilian before the whole city crumbles into nothingness, while of course at the same time trying to eliminate hundreds of thousands of Ultron copies. It really was kind of stupid. If Marvel is really afraid of showing something like that then don't show it. Don't make it look very cheesy and completely impossible. The Marvel heroes somehow get the SHIELD club back together to help people escape a city being dropped from midair.

You get an interesting ending, like most Marvel movies, including a bit more about the infinity stones. But very vague, boring, and essentially, nothing new. Its the second Avengers film, and I find it the worse second film of the franchise. They really tried to hard in virtually every area. Just watch it and you'll know what I mean. From the beginning they are trying to be really funny with their hohohohehehe attitude where they are slaying Hydra's minions without breaking a sweat. The emotions, character development, and plot was all pretty bad. It was worth it just to see Ultron being evil.",6
I think I liked it?,17 November 2020,"Age of Ultron is a bit of a weird movie for me to talk about, due to the fact that I actually don't know if I liked it or not. I do think it is a good movie though, I'm just not sure if it was my cup of tea. As in the previous Avengers movie, the main attraction of the movie is the interactions between the heroes, and I greatly enjoyed all the dialogue driven scenes. I also like that this movie focuses more on exploring different characters and give them more depth, even though I don't find the new characters all that interesting. My big issue with this movie is that it feels a little too much like a compilation of setups and explanations, whic only exist to set up future movies. Some of this has to do with the somewhat boring plot, which only somewhat touches on new elements, the slightly messy pacing, and the new themes that felt a little undeveloped. The movie is fairly well directed, albeit not spectacularly so. The villain is alright, and I like how he is a portrayal of Starks darker side, though he was a little boring. The climax is also fine, even though it is another case of the world being destroyed if the heroes fail. Overall, this movie has flaws, and I don't know if I enjoyed watching it, but it is undoubtedly a good movie, and that's what matters the most I think.",4

Not as good as first one,27 April 2015,"I was looking forward to this as I really liked the first film but for me this isn't as good unfortunately.

What made first Avengers special was that, it delivered a very good story around morals, egos, personalities with a very good sense of humour while everyone was expecting just an action movie. It was cleverly written. A bit like the Iron Man 3.

This film gives us the expected action but not the story that I would have thought. It had the potential but it wasn't explored and lost to pure action. Still a good movie but wouldn't make me watch it second or third time like I did with the first one.

I do hope marvel pays more attention to good quality script going forward that brings out the vulnerabilities of human beings, conflicts of good and bad in people whether they are superheroes or not. Action films sells but cleverly written actions would also stay around a lot longer I think.",7
Solid film! But not better that the first one.,26 April 2015,"I just got back from the theater. I have been waiting for this for so long. But I have to say that I liked the first one better. I watched the first Avengers film more than 10 times and I love it every single time. But Age of Ultron had too much going on.Don't get me wrong, the film is pretty solid still.It's not like Spider Man 3 or amazing Spider Man 2. I still give it 8/10. It was fun to watch, and totally worth the wait, but I just didn't get that ""amazed feeling"" when I left the theater earlier. It was not consistent in maintaining it high and low moments.

I loved the new additions in this film, I enjoyed watching Scarlet Witch, Vision and Quicksilver. I think Iron Man gets the spotlight once again (I am not an Iron Man fan) which for me is kind of annoying. But I have to admit, I enjoyed watching the Hulk and Hulkbuster fight. It was awesome!!! I kinda wanted to see more Thor and Captain America moments and less Black Widow, Hawkeye and Iron Man moments.

Ultron as a villain is pretty scary but I just didn't like how they killed him off. It was just a ""meh"" moment in the film.

Maybe I need to watch it again and again to get the ""high"" from this film. I don't want to say that I'm disappointed with AoU, but it 20% less than what I expected. Nonetheless, I still recommend you to watch this film, it's a good film, maybe it's just my personal taste.

My top 3 Marvel films still are:

An entertaining package of characters and ideas where lot less than the first film. also it lack the overall soul in the story.If the spectators can avoid the first avengers installment for 2 and a half hours I say the movies is little more enjoyable. But considering the stunning fights and graphic works I say it's one time watchable in many ways. The story ends with the introduction of new villain with the hope of one more installment. any way lets hope an Avengers 3 would be little more enjoyable than avengers 2.",6
Marvellous Marvel,6 May 2015,"6 May 2015 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - Avengers - The Age of Ultron. Another marvellous masterpiece from Marvel. If you're a fan of the genre I'm sure you'll love it as much as I did, if not, well I guess it's your loss. When Tony Stark convinces Bruce a banner to help him kick start an unfinished peace keeping programme called Ultron all kind a of hell is released and it's up to our favourite team of superheroes to restored order to the world. These films are some of the best kind of escapism you can imagine, it's all totally unbelievable but so terribly exciting to watch. Someone once asked me which was my favourite Avenger and I thought about that as I was watching tonight and I've come to the conclusion that's a question that should never be asked. Although the actors are looking somewhat older these days I am convinced there are another couple of Avenger films In all of them, after all Han Solo is about to return in Star Wars. I reckon this film is worth another watch, shame I missed it in 3D.",9
Been there done that!,18 May 2015,"After the entire list of user reviews, all has been said. What more can be added to the many reviews? Not much. So basically the movie is enjoyable. There is no character development, not much of a story and there are many non-threatening robot type figures to smash and kill again. They have added romance, without it being romantic, and they have added more product placement and vague hints of potential story lines for upcoming Thor and Captain America movies. The Avengers is becoming a social gathering of heroes in between their own profitable movies. I very much enjoyed reading the Avengers comics books; much more than seeing the Avengers movies. This is disappointing considering I was looking forward to the movies after reading and collecting the Marvel Universe in the 70s and 80s.

What's next? If they can develop characters, cut down on the many Avengers they have on screen and develop more inter-team battling (much like in the comics), create better villains, then, we may have something here. In the comics, many times, there were some Avengers away on assignment; therefore it made for better reading and story development. Try it next time guys! 6 of 10.",6

"The ""usual"" last decade's superhero movie with 1/4 of Billion worth of CGI",8 June 2015,"A little bit of everything in this blockbuster, with lots of Superheroes to choose and have fun with.

There are some ""great words"", some ""oneliners"", threats and forgiveness, some romance, some laughs, some...well...some of everything.

But the way I see it there are 2 reasons to watch this. 1) the progression of the story (if you care about it) and 2) the rich and literally expensive CGI. You see despite the fact that you see ""lot's of places"" in modern movies, all this was shot in a..studio.

Overall: The ""usual"" last decade's superhero movie with 1/4 of Billion worth of CGI!",
Follows in Man of Steel's footsteps,4 May 2015,"Fairly disappointed in this film. So many unanswered questions from previous Avengers films...

1. How is Thor on Earth when Loki is now ruling Asgard?

2. Why would Thanos knowingly give up an Infinity Stone in Avengers 1?

3. Didn't Tony Stark retire as Iron Man?

The first film succeeded, partially, because it didn't take itself too seriously and found the right balance. This second act seemed to go out of its way to insult itself. The scene where Hawkeye describes how ridiculous it is that he fights with a bow and arrow to Scarlett Witch is a good example of this.

What bothered me the most though might've been the decision to give Ultron a sense of humor. Ultron isn't a human psychopath like the Joker. So giving Ulton a personality didn't really make sense to me and really screwed up the tension that should've existed between the Avengers and Ultron. It seemed like the success of Guardians of the Galaxy may have added pressure to infuse more laughs into Age of Ultron than was necessary.

Bottom line: This was just an average action film that fails to distinguish itself. It falls more in line with Man of Steel, complete with excessively long and exhausting action sequences, than the upper tier comic book films such as Avengers 1, Dark Knight, Guardians, etc.",6
The Best just got Better,23 April 2015,"To give this film less than a 10 would be an insult. From the beginning to the end the movie rampages with so much action and wit you can scarcely take it all in. It's like Avengers Assemble on steroids!!! Even now I feel like I need time to process everything I just watched.. then head back in to see it again. Each character gets their moment to shine,only taken to another level.. and Ultron is wonderfully insane with a wit to match.. even beating others to the punch-line. And yes we finally see the Vision.. and he's amazing.. and yes you get to see lots of him.. he's not just tagged on 10 minutes from the end. I could write for days about this film.. but why bother...

Avengers-age of Ultron also showcased twins genetically developing, Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch are loosed upon the world. ""He's fast and she's weird"". And the Ultron is the brainchild of Stark, who envisions a global peacekeeping force powered by artificial intelligence. In movie the Black Widow and Hulk fall in love. And yet ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" is still a movie worth looking. It's smarter and better. But it's also the second of at least four movies and it plays like it.

"5 word review: Relentlessly Enjoyable, Action-packed Summer Fun",10 May 2015,"Firefely's Joss Whedon, writer/director of The Avengers (2012,) returns to the helm of Avengers: Age of Ultron and makes the Marvel Cinematic Universe franchise the highest-grossing of all time, surpassing Potter and Bond with over 8 billion US dollars worldwide. And with a cast list that is, in the words of Tony Stark, ""multiplying quicker than a Catholic rabbit,"" the franchise is going nowhere but up. Featuring a cast whose superpower is making a billion dollars and the third most viewed trailer of 2014 on YouTube, it would have to do something significant to disappoint.

Luckily, it doesn't disappoint. Whedon employs his ever-popular writing skills again to great success, and with more characters comes more exciting action, whilst the villain rises above most MCU fare. (Many will be hard- pressed to remember Tim Roth, Sam Rockwell or Christopher Eccleston as great Marvel villains.) The Whedon Banter Effect is in play in this sequel more notably, with (*breathe*) Robert Downey Jr, Chris (Evans and Hemsworth) Scarlett Johansson, Mark Ruffalo, Jeremy Renner, Don Cheadle, Cobie Smulders, Samuel L. Jackson, Paul Bettany, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Elizabeth Olsen and James Spader all playing off each other brilliantly. Each have great lines and great moments, and despite an inevitable feeling of over-stuffing, Whedon does manage to create individual moments for everyone. He is most successful with Renner's Clint Barton. Overlooked and mocked as 'that guy with a bow and arrow who hangs with the Avengers' after his previous appearance in 2012, he is utilised to much greater effect in this film, with more about him being revealed and more time devoted to him to do things. The action carries the film, making it relentlessly and consistently enjoyable as the Avengers carry out their globe-trotting mission to track down and destroy Tony Stark's project gone wrong, Ultron.

Having watched and loved the wonderfully eerie Pinocchio-inspired trailer, we were all keen to see (or hear) the fantastic James Spader, he of the velvet voice, in action. And although it may have surprised some to see the way Ultron was actually portrayed in the film, it is not, looking back, at all a bad depiction of him. Being a creation of Tony Stark, he is meant to be a twisted reflection of him, including his out-of-place humour. Having only seen the terrifying, monologuing side of him from the trailers, he may come across as a little 'goofy' in the actual film. And there are some of these such moments, making it a tad irritating not to see him monologue threateningly more. But the same rings true for all the characters, leading into the biggest criticism of 'Age of Ultron.' In the midst of awesome action sequences filled with stupendous visual effects, not one of the characters ever feels in danger, making it seem like Whedon doesn't know how to write without every character being a witty bad-ass with a one-liner constantly at hand. Around 40% of the lines are probably one-liners in this film. I love one-liners, but even I have to admit there are too many in this. Whilst we're on criticisms, the main problem with the MCU format means that every film's climax now feels unfinished and too much a setup for the next. We may see that the endings to all 600 Marvel films from now to 2018 will be left setting up for the two-part ""Infinity War"" showdown in 2018/19. Also, Andy Serkis is just not in it enough, but this may make it sound more of a criticism than it actually is - Age of Ultron is über-entertaining, and is basically the perfect summer movie (though not quite to the extent of Guardians of the Galaxy.) The best villain since Loki and countless wonderful characters (including a surprisingly great turn from 'The Vision,' a new character), plus a heartfelt conclusion, make Avengers: Age of Ultron a mindless yet enjoyable 8.0/10.",7
The Avengers: Age of Ultron is pure awesome,3 May 2015,"I remember seeing the first Avengers in theaters three years ago at a midnight screening and I was utterly impressed. That was definitely one of the best films I saw that year. Today, I hit the theaters to see The Avengers: Age of Ultron, and I was pretty ecstatic. While the first one was just a slight bit better, this one was quite entertaining. I enjoyed the characters, I enjoyed the story, and the action scenes were just awesome. Probably one of the best films I have seen this year.....so far

Our favorite superheros: Iron Man, Captain America, Hulk, Thor, Hawkeye, and Black Widow return, along with newcomers, Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch, in an epic fight to save the world. When Iron Man builds a peacekeeping program that goes terribly wrong, the avengers must fend off against the evil villain it becomes, Ultron. The action sequences were great, especially the intense battle at the end. The story was pretty good as well, thought not quite as good as the story in the first one. I do, however, love how the story takes a darker turn over from the first story. I thought I was pretty interesting. On the other hand, I was a little more entertained by Loki from the first film than Ultron in this one. I found Loki to better villain. Overall, I had a great time watching this, I was not disappointed by this. It was highly entertaining and , at times, very funny. I love how the characters throw out their hilarious one-liners here and there. This is a movie that everyone should go see!!",9
Not as good as the first but still worthwhile,8 May 2015,"Age of Ultron: Watching Marvel films, it is hard to deny it is a lot of fun. We all know the films will never win any Oscars(outside of a long shot Oscar for best visual effects). The first Avengers was the most fun many people, including myself, have ever had watching a movie. The action, story, characters were all outstanding and wildly entertaining. With this sequel, most probably found themselves expecting a worthy successor. Although the beginning starts a little shaky and the villain isn't quite advertised accurately, Avengers: Age of Ultron still delivers incredible action and fantastic visual effects to leave the audience satisfied walking out the door.

I was pretty worried at the beginning of the movie. The dialogue was poorly-written and corny taking the audience away from the action and storyline. I was just hoping it would not be like this the whole movie. Thankfully, it wasn't but more on that in a second. Ultron, the new villain, in the movie was advertised as a very serious, powerful foe. Although Ultron is without a doubt powerful, the dialogue written for him was also very one-sided, and stupid giving no depth to the character. Yes, it is a ""robot"", but he is also supposed to be a highly, artificially intelligent life form. Ultron should have been portrayed this way, but sadly they flip-flopped between and powerful and serious to stupid and unnecessary one-liners.

As I said earlier, the movie had a rocky start but found it's stride after a few scenes. The thing Age of Ultron did the best, which not many other film franchises can did, is it found a way to balance all of it's characters. They have more star power than almost any film to date, and though there was not a lot of depth to some characters, we still got a feel at each and every character that was in the film. The thing that was the best move for the franchise was really exploring Hawkeye's character and developing the beginning conflict between Iron Man and Captain America. I do not want to give away any details, but suffice to say, it was enjoyable to say the least.

The real reason most people come to see a film like this is because of the promised great action sequences. Between Hulk and ""ultra"" Iron Man battling it out in the streets, Captain America hurling a motorcycle at an assault vehicle, and Thor knocking out over a thousand robots, great action sequences was surely delivered. Each actor did a good job as well. Robert Downey Jr. added his hilarious sarcastic humor to the movie and everyone in the audience appreciated it.

Is Avengers: Age of Ultron as good as the first? No, but it is still a quality sequel and you can't go wrong with watching it. I recommend you see Avengers: Age of Ultron while it is still in theaters.

Pure entertainment!,22 April 2015,"This is an Avengers movie and a Marvel movie in every sense of those words. It's an adventure, it's pure entertainment, it's a blockbuster, it's that kind of a joyride movie that gives you a little bit of everything. Action, humour, romance and drama wrapped in stunning visual effects. It's good versus evil and it's classic Hollywood. Think Star Wars. Think Indiana Jones. It's that type of movie. And I love that type of movie. I know this will only fuel a certain debate between rivaling fans, but it's the type of movie that makes me feel like a kid again. And that's a good thing.

"Great actors, great production, lots of actions but ...",30 April 2015,"In terms of production and CGI I can say this movie is better than the first AVENGER; however in terms of story; there is not much there. The first AVENGER was all about egos colliding and it really work. In fact the best thing was Loky and the constant fighting between them When at the end decided to fight together the movie lost lots of steam. The second installment find them together so Joss Whedon had to find a way to divide them and create conflict. His excuse is the madness of over egocentric Tony Stark by creating an AI based on the scepter of the first movie. Sadly from that on the story does not hold very well. As the conflict is not so believable than the first time; he basically creates a lot of one-liners for each characters that at least keep the humor on a good level.

I admire that Whedon gives a balanced moments for everybody to shine. Exception is Captain America with a character so stiff that seems to be wanting to be in another movie. The concept of Captain America been the leader (as being America the leader of the world) is somewhat uncomfortable and not quite proved here; specially when all the big thinking and planning comes from all the others. It is a pity because Chris Evans is not a bad actor but is unable to outshine his colleagues here. Downey as ever makes you cry and laugh without even putting a lot of effort. Hemwsworth THOR is quite sympathetic and can be funny and deep when is needed. Renner is an excellent actor and he really deserves a hit. As a family man, he creates a lot of suspense by the end just with the look on his face. Ruffalo is also OK; but this time he is a little to depressive. His hint a romance with Black Widow is like a fresh air in the movie; but is she who creates the sexual tension. Scarlett is as always too good for any movie. She is the only action hero that can be feminine ever during the fights and also we a desirable woman. Taylor-Johnson is fine; but I would like his character to be bigger. Olsen is really terrifying as Scarlett Witch with almost no talking. In my opinion she was as good as Johansson even with less screen time. On the action department; again Whedon is not that good. Relying to much on CGI is not longer interesting. There are spectacular scenes on the beginning and the end that never transmit a sense of real danger. Perhaps; the fight between Iron Man and Hulk is the best and funniest action set in the whole movie. In brief; it is not a boring movie; lots of action but the best are the character interacting between them. Let's hope somebody find a way on the third Avenger to make something different because this will not hold for a third time.",7
Very disappointing,25 April 2015,"Just an awful, confused mess.

I love a lot of Whedon's work but this was so bad. Found it painful to watch.

Could well be the turning point where the public falls out of love with superhero movies.

Don't believe the hype, it's a really, really bad movie. Even though I really liked the characters going into the movie, from very early on the chemistry and charm is completely gone. Maybe I missed or had forgotten something from an earlier MCU movie but it seemed like the story line took a huge unexplained jump forward at the beginning of the movie, a poor start which descended further into overwrought, meaningless, drivel.

So many of what should be crucial scenes are entirely unconvincing, clichéd or ridiculous in a way that's too forced to even be funny.",1
Copy of the first film,26 April 2015,,7
"Not a home run like the first, this is still blockbuster filmmaking done right",22 April 2015,"I don't believe many would argue against us being a spoilt generation, a generation that expects a great deal and expects it better and faster each time. It's a mindset that encompasses most of our everyday life, whether we are waiting for our next coffee, our next parcel of goods ordered over the internet, there are countless aspects of our everyday life that we now merely take for granted, a state of being that has stemmed to most facets of our life including our movie watching tastes and expectations.

In the ever increasing world domination of the Marvel universe, comic book lovers and superhero loving cinema patrons have been treated to a plethora of big screen spectacles over the recent years, particularly within the last decade. In that time we've been witness to arguably the greatest ever molding of characters and material with the incredibly popular and rightfully well-loved The Avengers. The Avengers was everything you could want from a movie featuring men in tights, angry green beasts and an archer with a never-ending supply of arrows, and us being the generation we are wanted more, we wanted it faster, better and more blowing so how does Age of Ultron satisfy the needs of its fervent watchers?

It was always going to be an extremely tough task for Marvel and director Joss Whedon to top the first Avengers and many will ask as a first point of call if Age of Ultron is as good or better than the first and to answer that straight up you'd have to say no. A no answer is anything but bad news however as Age of Ultron still possesses the quick-fire wit, the stunning imagery and fantastic camaraderie between the films many stars that made the first such a memorable adventure. Suffice to say much of the film's original novelty value of seeing the crew of heroes assemble for the first time is now largely gone but there growing relationships and angst that comes from time spent with one another is an interesting and well developed aspect of this new tale. There's potential love, pent up anger and some great double teaming of bad guys within the crack team and with Whedon's assured direction and scripting, Age of Ultron continues to be a step above other comic book movies in virtually all aspects. With seemingly all great aspects of the first Avengers intact here again what makes Ultron a lesser affair is sadly in it titular bad guy.

Loki became the perfect foe for our first outing in the Avengers movie, with Tom Hiddleston's great performance and some great lore behind his anger, he made for a thoroughly dastardly villain and one you couldn't take your eyes whenever he was on screen. In James Spader's Ultron we have a ""big bad"" that initially looks to steal the show only to become a character that is less the sum of his parts due to murky motivation and some seriously questionable quick production times on his evil plans. Spader does a great job of both his motion capture and voice work and is what I'd imagine a fantastic incarnation of the comic book favourite but there is something severely lacking in his progression in the film that holds this 2 hour plus story back. In other minor quibbles it feels as though both Scarlett Witch and Quicksilver are underused in what feels like an arc that would've benefited from these new additions more whilst being the spoilt cinema goers we are it does feel as though our grand finale is a little lacking especially when compared to the city leveling joys of the first outings showpiece or even this films incredibly fun Hulk rampage, who by the way is an ardent of Beats by Dr. Dre, who would've thought?.

With expectations high and with pre-hype at all new boisterous levels, Age of Ultron has some mighty goals to meet and while it doesn't feel like the home run of the first it most certainly is a hugely enjoyable big budget blockbuster that's wittier than countless so called comedies and more original than many of marvels recent diminishing adventures. We all know what the cast here can deliver and there all sufficiently on song and it's with great pleasure I can say Iron Man doesn't dominate every scene as his been known to do in the past so the load of quips and funnies is shared mostly evenly between our rag tag group.

Regardless of what one was to say about Age of Ultron its going to make Marvel and its parent companies a huge stash of money and as long as Marvel keeps producing Avenger films to this quality no one will begrudge them their success even though chinks in the previously untouchable armor are starting to show. So with that, we farewell Whedon you good sir, it's over to you Russo Brothers, we'll see you in a few years!

"Unbalanced in tone, but had some good moments",3 May 2015,,6
Still Awesome,23 April 2015,"The Avengers: Age of Ultron is meant to take this Marvel Universe into a whole new level. It introduces a villain that could lead these heroes into dark situations by giving them one of their ultimate tests. The movie lives up to that tone; it's not as humorous as its predecessor, and that is definitely not a bad thing since we want this material to step up into a grittier and much challenging approach, but the real problem is its plotting. There's so much build up to juggle, starting from its own plot to the upcoming installments of this franchise. It's still fun if you can tolerate its stalling foreshadowing, but to those who seek for compelling narrative, it somehow disappoints. Still, there's so much action and large scale worth checking out in this summer blockbuster.

The movie introduces new characters and new locations, telling us that this is definitely bigger than the first movie. When it proceeds to the actual plot, there is some intrigue to what the titular main villain is capable of. And so, there is more mayhem happening on screen, but they essentially exists for the story, of course. Though, after those nearly unending amount of heavy action, the movie suddenly settles to explore what else is going on in this universe. This middle act somehow intrudes its main plot, aside of some few drama, the movie is pretty much preparing to what will happen next. It's feels long, even if it's actually not. At these moments, it doesn't feel like it's supposed to develop enough of the actual storyline. Many of the subplots in those minutes seems to belong to another set of movies that are yet to exist. Sure, we discover more information from its characters, but most of the time, it's a filler of cliffhangers.

What really troubles here is how it aims to be a setup of numerous events, like the phase 3 of Marvel Studios and the climax. The movie would have been nicer if it explores more of Ultron's abilities and not just making plans, controlling drones and preaching monologues (the film kind of only teases and mostly verbalizes that he can hijack through networks worldwide.) Or build up a different theme for the Avengers team instead of them trying to hate each other again like in the first one. But if we're not talking about its story, then the movie works magnificently in its action. To those who are in for some bigger, louder and more destructive than ever set pieces, then this sequel must be a marvelous feast. The Hulk vs. Stark's Hulkbuster Armor scene is such a glorious sequence of just seeing things getting hit and destroyed, more well constructed and thrilling than a mediocre blockbuster would do. The rest of the action is a tremendous blend of pretty spectacles, sudden suspense, sudden comedy and impressive choreography. As popcorn cinema goes, this is perfect for a superhero movie experience.

Aside of the action, nothing spices these movies up more than its actors. The cast does their thing; with Robert Downey Jr. trying to add more depth to Tony Stark than just bringing more memorable punchlines, Chris Evans stays cool as Captain America, Chris Hemsworth sticking with his charisma as Thor. There's an interesting turn between Black Widow and The Hulk, which Scarlett Johansson and Mark Ruffalo buying into their characters' chemistry. Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen are additions that can be worth rooting for, with their characters' mysterious nature and well, accents. And finally, what everyone is so stoked about is James Spader as the main villain, Ultron. Spader verbally brings more menace to the character, understanding the angst and potential threat behind this robot. There is levity exists in this character as well, and he nicely balanced it with Ultron's darkside.

The Avengers: Age of Ultron is a little too burdened by the future. As an exclusive narrative, the movie seems lacking, sure the action is too awesome to contain, but when it comes to the storytelling, it feels like it isn't going anywhere further until the climax. But even for a film that is reserved enough from showing a much complex or much adventurous plot, it's still a grand experience, thanks to its undeniably exciting action, some interesting character-work, and other clever elements. But then, we want these movies to offer beyond that standards; as in a story that could move forward way far behind the first Avengers movie. Well apparently, it does, but the effort of going through that result just doesn't seem enough. It's more innovation, then save it for later. Then again, there's nothing wrong if you still want to spend two hours seeing our favorite heroes clash together, even in a senseless way. Because blockbusters are supposed to be fun and this movie still lives up to that promise.",8

Marvel's The Avengers Age Of Ultron.,9 May 2015,"The Avengers are back in action now with a larger threat.The Avengers:Age Of Ultron is a fun movie that can be enjoyed by many but the movie feels a little bit in a hurry and so many plot accompanied with,and a creepy romance that seems forced out.But the movie still amused me till the end no matter what people said that this movie isn't good as the first movie or a good movie in general.If you're Marvel Fan the movie will still amuse you but if you're not is up to you to judge the film. Anyway the movie isn't bad nor great it is just a good film, I enjoy the film but they can do better than this.The movie is fun and action packed.I enjoy this sequel more than it's prequel""TheAvengers"".With great characters and a good but great villain in an action packed accompanied with a great humor The Avengers is a fun and enjoyable blockbuster.",8

Joss Whedon is a genius,26 April 2015,,8
Welp... It's an Avengers movie,1 June 2015,"Avengers 2: Age of Ultron is a two-and-a-half-hour light and sound show with something resembling a plot. A lot of CGI robots get beat up, with no lasting effects on anything. Black Widow and Hulk have been ordered by the screenwriter to have a relationship, and they dutifully comply. Alan Shore from Boston Legal has robot lips and says a bunch of awful one-liners. Actually, everybody says a bunch of awful one-liners. Teamwork is the only way to save the day from whatever, and even though they've all been through this before, they decide to stop working as a team, in order to keep the movie going. Iron Man and the Hulk punch each other forever in a CGI sequence that could have been over in two minutes for all the effect it has on the plot. An establishing shot of the previous shot's location happens about halfway through the movie to allow for commercial breaks, just in case cable still exists by the time this movie leaves theaters.

As a light-and-sound show, Avengers 2: Age of Ultron is acceptable. I did not feel too bored looking at the screen for two and a half hours, and sometimes, I would see something on the screen that will probably make a pretty cool toy for someone who is into that. Me, I'd spend that money watching Fury Road again instead.",6

Avengers vs Transformers,4 May 2015,"I thought this was a good movie but not a great movie compared to the first Avengers movie and Captain America: Winter Soldier. There were some typical mindless action scenes and there were some funny humor scenes like the first movie. I'm a comic book collector and I always thought Ultron would sound like the Daleks from Doctor Who TV series. Ultron sounded like Agent Smith from The Matrix. And what's the deal with Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch's ethnic accent? They're Americans not Europeans. Their father Magneto was a refugee from post WW2 Europe. That's the only thing I found annoying in the movie. Overall, it's a good movie to take your kids or your girlfriend to watch with.",7
Better than Avengers 1,19 October 2020,"I feel AAOU was a better movie than its first. Visually and story wise it out beats A1 by 69%.

The movie is about a killer robot created by the ""good"" guy who is having traumatic episodes since A1. He builds an AI who wants to be the saviour of this ugly earth by giving it a gift of destruction.

Cap: Was good. Shown he is a leader. OP is some places.

Iron man: an immature jerk he caused ultron and didn't get punished.

Hulk and widow: sissy Black widow subplot

Thor: had good fight scenes but was a side character at best.

Ultron: is nothing like the comics. He is more like a evil clown robot without make up.

Hawkeye: they could utilize this character but they wasted him instead.

Quicksilver and the witch: I thought QS was the coolest and best of the two. Sad he didn't see it coming. The Witch is alright.

Overall its a fun superhero flick. Like many mcu movies before it has plot holes and unanswered question such as Vision lifting up Thor's hammer. They never purely explained it.

from start to creating ultron felt rushed. Its basically the movie starts, Stark creates ultron and ultron arrives. I didn't like it. There was no build up.

Verdict: its just an mcu movie, but it was a fun movie nevertheless.",9

"Had it flaws, yet an exciting approach to the Marvel's 2nd phase",15 August 2015,"Joss Whedon is too talented to keep making these thin, unremarkable Marvel movies, and this is a lazy sequel that feels like more of the same compared to the first Avengers film, especially as it has all the problems found in that one and a plot that is even more poorly developed. The movie did have some edge of the seat action sequences, especially the chaos between Hulk & Iron Man yet the poor character developments of the Marvel's speedster Hovok & Scarlet Witch is a little disappointing. The addition of Paul Bettany's ""The Vision"" works flawlessly, he was a personal favorite for me. But overall Avengers Age Of Ultron is an extremely enjoyable addition to the Marvel franchise.",7

Why do artists destroy their own great creations. Avengers was a team we admired so much. The sequel is a heart-breaking disappointment,25 April 2015,,3
As Often As Fantastic As It Is Frustrating,12 May 2015,"Joss Whedon's The Avengers, released in 2012, was the epitome of why the Marvel Cinematic Universe was gathering so much success: fantastic action set pieces, robust performances from a star-filled ensemble and a light-hearted tone all of which were balanced by Whedon's palpable love for the comic book source material. Move forward to the present, and it seems there's little to halt the MCU'S success. Captain America: The Winter Solider represented a radical shift in tone from its predecessor and had fans and critics alike plastering it with praise. The real triumph of the MCU thus far however is James Gunn's gloriously fresh Guardians of the Galaxy. As such, it's saddening and astonishing just how much of Age of Ultron I found divisive.

Starting with the criticisms: I felt that Ultron as a villain was handled fairly inconsistently. His radical aim for mankind's annihilation inclined me to see his as a threat, yet his insistence on repeatedly spouting flat, mostly unfunny one liners painted him as much less frightening. This was a problem not merely restricted to Ultron: I found much of the humour in the film fell completely flat, i.e. Captain America and Tony Starks cringe-inducing 'mind your language' banter. I also found that certain specific sequences ruptured the pacing and organic feel of the film. For instance, the scene in which Thor goes into a lake and communicates with his home planet evidently is set up for Thor: Ragnarok, yet it adds little but simply more excess in a film which is already felt bloated.

I felt where this film excelled best is in its balance of character. Combining all the heroes from its predecessor, with numerous new heroes and cameos along the way, Whedon manages to maintain a balance between their different skills and imperfections. Hawkeye, often previously as the most expendable of the group, is given a surprising amount of screen time, and any questions previously raised regarding his suitability alongside Thor and the Hulk has been completely nullified. I found the on majority the new additions to The Avengers were very successful, in particular both Black Widow and Quicksilver, who not only were far more captivating than Ultron himself but also provided the seams of conflict which raged throughout the team and will undoubtedly be the dominant theme throughout the subsequent Captain America: Civil War.",6
"""Clearly you've never made an omelet!""",26 April 2015,,9
Disappointing but saved by the last act,3 May 2015,"Halfway through the movie, yes, I was disappointed. Avengers 2 falls into the common super hero movie trap of spending too much time explaining technology / fantasy (a McGuffin basically) that will never make sense. And it is frustrating and slow at times because of that. If you add to this some disappointments vs. what was promised in the trailer and some not so exciting new characters (first time for me in a marvel movie...) Avengers 2 does fail to deliver. BUT BUT a great third act and final fight scene save the movie for Marvel zombies such as myself. Truly epic, great Whedon-esque character dynamic and team ups. The movie does offer a lot to like: a fantastic James Spader as Ultron, Hawkeye! (How can Whedon make Hawkeye actually rule!)... However this is the not the best marvel movie. Will still go see it again in Paris next week. PS: Bryan Singer did Quicksilver better than Whedon....",7
"Another Marvel Film With Same Type Of Story ,But With The Greatest Action Marvel Ever Delivered",30 April 2015,"the avengers age of ultron is about ultron technology means a computer with brain , tony stark made ultron to save earth from unwanted goons coming from another world ,he wanted ultron as a protecting shield for earth but all goes wrong , banner and stark made ultron without disclosing the plan (as they knew that no one will agree to it and everyone will argue ) , but ultron technology goes wrong and according to him the earth could be saved when there will be no avengers , but what he actually wanted is to destroy whole humanity and to create another world which only have robots like him and our avengers with some new friends tries to stop him

whats cool about the movie :

great action ( best among of all marvel movies) the science and fiction was well executed in the movie (and it was truly entertaining) the dialouges were great and better this time (especially from tony stark) the film has some good humorous jokes and scenes too.

whats bad :

the same old story line ( i.e to save earth from robots ,aliens etc etc...) i don't know when the earth will become safe according to marvel

the movie was missing the great villain character like loki as in the previous movie ( the ultron was villain but as it was just a robot so it was just OK)

conclusion :yes this movie is a definite watch for all marvel fans and non marvel fans as well ,the movie is packed with great action and good dialouges and humour",9
Not As Good As the First But Still A Watchable Movie,25 November 2015,"Avengers: Age of Ultron is the 11th entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Let me get this out of the way first: The first Avengers movie in my opinion was much better than this one. Once again, Joss Whedon directs and does an excellent job. Also the cast is unbeatable with Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark/Iron Man, Chris Evans as Steve Rogers/Captain America, Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner/Hulk, Scarlett Johansen as Black Widow, Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye, and Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury. Newcomers are Aaron Taylor-Johnson as Quicksilver and Elizabeth Olsen as Scarlet Witch as well as James Spader as Ultron. The cast does a great job.

Now the story is where the problems come for me. The main plot is pretty much Tony Stark and Bruce Banner invent Ultron which was supposed to protect but then it decides to destroy. Ultron honestly didn't feel that menacing as compared to villains from other MCU films like Loki in The Avengers or the Winter Soldier in Cap. America 2. But he is hilarious. The story jumps all over the place with parties to small battles to large scale city battles. The Hulk vs Hulk-Buster sequence was probably my favorite scene of the entire movie since the final battle wasn't really impressive compared to the first Avengers. For all the other effects and action, it's been seen before in countless other action and superhero movies. Then there's this whole romance with Black Widow and Banner and it's like where on earth did that come from?? There were a few times when I felt flat out bored during this movie. Nothing of much interest happened in these scenes. However, the ending and the post credit scenes were pretty cool and make the future installments in the MCU look very promising.

Overall, I can say I had an OK time with Avengers: Age of Ultron. For me, it didn't live up to many other MCU movies like The Avengers, Iron Man, Captain America: The Winter Soldier, and Guardians of the Galaxy. From A+ to F, Avengers: Age of Ultron gets a B-.",7
"Just short of the first one, but still pretty stellar",24 April 2015,,9
"Whedon assembles a solid, if flawed, sequel",3 May 2015,"There are a lot of great things in here; scenes, character moments, lines of dialog. It's just that as a whole it doesn't flow as smoothly or with as much energy as the first one (granted that's a pretty high bar). It doesn't help that Ultron is a weak villain. His potential menace is all too often undercut by the fact that sometimes James Spader seems not to be playing Ultron, but a mechanical James Spader. My other gripe would be that the fights/action feel a bit redundant and look more cartoonish than the original. On its own merits this is nothing short of a very entertaining Summer popcorn flick. The problem is that the first one was that and so much more.",7
A for Avengers. A for Awesome!,22 April 2015,"Once upon a time the prospect of bringing The Avengers together as a movie seemed like a daunting task. Gathering the leads from four separate movie franchises plus two supporting characters and villain and doing it successfully was a potential challenge. Unfortunately for Director Joss Whedon, he made it look easy – the original Avengers was a massive success – the third highest grossing film ever which raised the expectations for sequels. Age of Ultron (AOU) arrives three years later – not just a follow up to The Avengers but also to 2014's superb Captain America: The Winter Soldier (CATWS), where the concluding events had massive repercussions in the Marvel Universe. Whilst it may not hit the fun heights of the original movie, this darker, grittier sequel raises the bar to a new level.

Following the collapse of SHIELD and criminal organisation Hydra in CATWS, The Avengers are now being funded by Tony Stark. Whilst on a mission to retrieve a Hydra weapon in Eastern Europe, a run-in with a pair of powerful twins, Wanda (Scarlett Witch) and Pietro Maximoff (Quicksilver), Stark has a vision of the world's end and the Avengers dead. Convinced the world needs more protection than the Avengers can give, Stark, along with sceptical but willing Bruce Banner, discover technology that will help re-start a dormant Artificial Intelligence world defence programme called Ultron. Before long, Ultron takes form, becomes self-aware and decides that the best way for world peace is humanity's extinction.

After Ulton's escape, The Avengers aggressively pursue him across several countries in order to thwart his plans. With the Maximoff twins working alongside Ultron, The Avengers are thrown into disarray as their own fears and pasts come back to haunt them and begin to doubt their unity as a team.

The action comes thick and fast and only slows down occasionally to provide a few back stories for both Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) who was criminally underused in the original film, and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson). The initial attack on Hydra's base is brilliantly executed as the camera follows each of the battling Avengers around a forest in one continuous action shot. We finally get to witness the Hulk well and truly off the leash as Iron Man is forced to bring in his ""Hulkbuster"" suit in order to take him down in a fantastic display of destruction. And of course there is the big action climax where director Whedon throws everything at the audience as The Avengers battle Ultron's endless army of clones.

It would be unfair to give away anymore plot details as this would ruin the twists in-store but AOU sets up the next five Marvel movies nicely in both subtle and obvious ways. The most amazing aspect of AOU is how each of the six Avengers get their own chance to shine – none of them are neglected – signs of a great writing team and director. New character Scarlett Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) is a highlight and is just one of the new characters that will play a key role in the Marvel Universe. All credit has to go to director Whedon for handling such a monumental cast and making a movie on a scale not seen before as well as being laugh out loud funny throughout. A for Avengers. A for Awesome.",9
(Sigh),8 May 2015,"I think the Marvel studio heads should realise now that comic books and film are two very different media. I don't feel like I'm watching a film franchise any more but a television series on steroids. And everything has to tie into the next couple of episodes.

And hence you get to see this bloated mess with so many sub-plots and really uneven pacing. Initially it starts off strong, cool action sequence in a snowy mountain and everything. Then Tony Stark and Bruce Banner create an artificial intelligence via Mcguffin and it becomes sentient and then genocidal. Which at this point in the MCU Tony has become such an unlikeable character. I don't understand why Hank Pym wasn't introduced earlier on in the franchise. It wouldn't balanced out Tony's character a lot more, but now he's reckless and just straight up stubborn.

Once Ultron gets loose this is where you get to see why the first film was so much better. Much of the second act in the first film had all the characters, even the antagonist Loki, in the heli- carrier, and you get to see them all interact, develop character and advance the plot. Here the second act was literally all over the place as they hopped from one set-piece to another. First you have the Iron-Man Hulkbuster throwdown in Wakanda where they level a 30 story building where it brought up uncomfortable 9/11 imagery. Then the movie just stops where all the characters reconvene in a log cabin where Hawkeye can finally get some character development so the audience can be told 'Hey! He's not that useless. We hired Oscar Nominee Jeremy Renner for a reason'. Then you have a forced romance between Banner and Romanoff which came out of left field. I'm sorry what was all that between her and Captain America in the Winter Soldier for? And what happened to Betty Ross? Then you have Thor and his water well, I dunno. The second act was disorienting to say the least.

Ultron is not a good a villain as Loki. He's an artificial intelligence who has access to nuclear launch codes, and the characters point that out but he doesn't go through with it and instead opts for a more convoluted scheme. Also at times he gets very comical. The final confrontation between the Avengers and Ultron was also messy. The previous film also had an intense chaotic final act but it was still easy to follow. This one got really difficult to follow with characters disappearing for minutes at a time and attending to stuff which really seemed minor to me at times.

As a Marvel film its nowhere near as good as the first Iron Man, the fist Avengers film or the Winter Soldier. However as a popcorn flick its still there. Hmmmmmmmmmm.",7
Most cliché film. Waste of money and time.,23 April 2015,"I am 17 years old with Film as one of my main hobbies. I have watched hundreds and hundreds of films and this film comes close to being in the top 5 hated films! No joke. I paid £8.00 to see this film and it is the biggest waste of money. The film lacked many things, one being humour. It was more full of cliché lines and it was rather a cliché film; no uniqueness to it at all, furthermore, the film seemed to drag on way too much and for no need at all, the characters didn't get a clear introduction to the film and left the audience somewhat confused. It was however not shy of action by the least. This is my first review on a film and I felt like I had to do it because the film was so bad in my opinion and would not want anyone to spend £1 on it let alone £8.",2
At least the action was good,4 May 2015,"Even though it's not as great a movie as its predecessor it is IMAX 3D... ahem... worthy. (Pun is bad and I should feel bad.) The special effects were awesome and I loved every bit of it. But I was confused by the storyline. Actually it's not so much confused by the storyline as confused by the lack thereof.

Confession time - I have never read a superhero comic book. The first time I heard of Ultron was the time I heard about this movie. When I got to know it's AI, I was like ""Supercool. It will be like Skynet."" If the AI program exists on the Internet, that means you would literally have to smash every piece of electronic on this planet to get rid of it. So I was expecting a really complex plot line.

So here is the actual story of Avengers: Age of Ultron -

Avengers: Age of Ultron,30 April 2015,"When Tony Stark tries to jumpstart a dormant peacekeeping program, things go awry and it is up to the Avengers to stop the villainous Ultron from enacting his terrible plans.

Marvel's Avengers Assemble hit theaters in 2012 and it was an instant success. Joss Whedon had delivered everything we wanted: charm, action and heart. The film is ranking now in the three highest grossing film of all time after Titanic and Avatar. Kevin Feige and his associates have built a cinematic empire quite unprecedented in Hollywood history, a genuine solar system. In fact, since the first Avengers movie we've seen Iron Man, Captain America, Thor on their own; now we have the chance to see them interact once more and how their have changed, how their world have changed through those films which is something very unique to Marvel in movie business. Age of Ultron is picking up where last year's Captain America: The Winter Soldier left off. The film actually dives right into the action as the team has already been assembled, we get straight to the things that matter and skip the hour long ""assembling"" part of the first movie. It helps that characters wear these roles as comfortably as second skin. The film benefits also from this much more global scale, compared to its predecessor. We needed new location, as the majority of superhero movies are set in New-York, it became a little cliché and repetitive to see another tall skyline with a fight happening on top. Age of Ultron provides just that. Our heroes visit Europe, Asia and Africa as Ultron goes global in attempt to wipe out mankind. The opening sequence is an incredible piece of action filmmaking, staged as a single shot that shows all Whedon's brilliance.

These characters are the most important thing. This film allows us to a deeper understanding of the characters and to emotionally connect with them in ways we never did before. There are material for humour and conflict as they pair up some characters in unexpected ways. Furthermore Humanity is found in each hero in more intimate and building-characters moment that had distinguished the first Iron Man and Captain America. We knew very little about Black Widow's back story, we heard some interesting hints at her past in The Avengers though. This is a character who's back story would translate very well onto the big screen due to her espionage narrative, plus she's a spy and spy have secrets. She also becomes the ""Hulk whisperer"". The intuitive tenderness with which she deals with the troubled and introspective Dr. Bruce Banner, played greatly again by Mark Ruffalo, is turning into a sweet love affair which gives the tender core of the movie and the most moving scenes. Clint Barton/Hawkeye checks in after spending most of the first movie as a mind controlled puppet. This film defines him as a person and as an Avenger as well, he's not only a cool guy with a bow and arrow. Distance from his usual family drama allows Hemsworth's Thor to shine a little more than last time. Steve Rogers/Captain America is once again a solid reminder of wartime values. While Stark's self doubt journey he took in Iron Man 3 is still evident and his obsession to create a perfect piece to protect the earth is still alive. Robert Downey Jr. is pure gold as Tony Stark and his differences with Captain America provides most of the comic relief, as well as the serious differences in their philosophy is where the real depth can be found.

Why All This Hate I'm Seeing? Age of Ultron was GREAT!,21 May 2015,,9
Good but not EPIC,1 May 2015,"I believe if another 20 minutes was spent on story and character development, the movie would hit the mark, but it felt incomplete.

Without giving away the details, the story of Ultron's creation and endgame felt rushed, into him being nothing more than a computer virus. Also with the addition of the 'new avengers', their development for all but one was very poor, especially at the end and you ask yourself ""well who's that guy"".

Then there were things that were thrown in and not followed up on, like ""the lullaby"", and one members feeling of 'lesser worth'. If you are going to throw stuff in, why introduce it and not follow up on it?

This will undoubtedly be a hit, and its certainly worth the full price of admission, but with all the hype I expected something crisper.",6
Assemble Once More,3 May 2015,"I loved the first avengers film for its colorful characters, great visuals and superb writing, and I loved this film for the very same reason, the new characters introduced such as Quicksilver, Scarlet Witch and Vision were all well written. All of the actors from the previous film reprized their roles and once again did an amazing job, the acting is some of the best I've seen in a comic book film this side of The Dark Knight. The cinematography was once again well done, the fighting scenes were of large scale and an impressive amount of detail was put into them. Ultron was a great villain, and while he wasn't as great as Loki, James Spadar played him very well. But Robert Downy Junior was my favorite, as he always is, Tony Stark will always be my favorite Avenger, I am very excited for Avengers 3 now, while Marvel Phase 1 movies are in my opinion, better than the phase 2 movies, it still closed in a bang with this incredible film.

Joss Whedon falls short to recreate 2012's magic,4 May 2015,"Well i had no idea before, that i would be writing this for my most anticipated and favorite movie of this Summer and will be giving 8/10 after watching movie, as first time i was so confident even before watching movie that content wise it will be novel and superb like 1st part and will get 10/10.

But i was surprised this time that movie from beginning missed that spark which we seen in last avengers movie even in captain America: winter soldier. I was waiting and waiting and watching clock that now this movie will pick up the space and that spark but till interval i couldn't find that magic.

Film lacks humor and consistency in screenplay in first half though this time movie has a lot of adventure and you will love to see all superheroes together almost all time. Film climax is long and definitely way better and powerful than the first part.

Now talking about some new characters. Vision is superb inclusion in MCU, twins really showed perfect screen presence and power pack performances but this time scene stealer was undoubtedly Hawkeye and i am very happy with the growth of his character as i am a big fan of him. I loved to see how they showed him as an underdog and his dialogues, family part and interaction with other superheroes all were awesome.

For ultron, i read somewhere that he is the best villain of MCU and on par with dark knight's joker. It was really a shitty comment because even Loky was way better than ultron. I missed the aggression and strong dialogues in Ultron's character.

Well overall at the end if you are crazy Marvel fan like me, you gonna like this movie for the reasons i wrote before. Go for it . You will love it.",8

And then ""run and hide..."". And finally, Black Widow says ""Nothing lasts forever"". And then Captain says ""except for TROUBLE TROUBLE"". 2. Cool characters like the twins. But weird that they kept on saying ""enhanced"" instead of ""mutant"". The bad. 1. WHY?! did Black Widow like Hulk? Since when?! I thought she and Hawkeye were a thing! And suddenly Hawkeye is out of the picture with a family? And I can't believe Black Widow would be so vulnerable about her feelings, or care that she can't have children. She's tough, it's such a 180. 2. No Loki. The villain Ultron was lame and not a threat. He's just a machine. 3. Less funny from Iron Man, who seems like a douche. Overall, I feel that only Captain America and Thor acted as expected. It's OK but too long, too action.",7

Waste of Nick Fury, Waste of Hawkeye and his Family Came out of nowhere. Only technology and real locations along with character of Vision were 3 things to watch, everything else was ruined because of hurry and decision of making the movie shorter it should be of 3.15 hrs .then their could be some thing to proud. It Was Clear that director only want to reach to last 20 minutes of final epic fight which was great but almost ruined by all the trailers and TV-spots. so only for those 20-25 mins director dragged first half very harshly without giving any thrill except 1st 10 mins which were also spoiled by trailers. Hulk vs Hulkbuster was another thing that director must wanted to show so he did but everyone saw that in trailers..... I am Biggg Fan of Marvel movies but This movie is not upto its name. only blame is to director. His Hurry And Adding some big two or three things to make 2.22 hrs movie Failed. That's why he is no longer On Director's Chair. Captain America The Winter Soldier And Ironman:3 Were Much better Executed On screen......

One of the more weaker mcu films,8 September 2020,It is a good film but compared to the other mcu movies. It is one of the weaker ones. The story is average and the screenplay is pretty slow at points. The direction of the film is good. The CGI and visual effects are great. The performances of the entire cast are also good. If you want to watch it go ahead otherwise just skip it.,7
Age of Awesome,23 April 2015,"The expectations were high. There were no doubts about that. It was about how different they were going to make this from the first one. Especially considering the standards that the previous Captain America and Thor movies had set. Joss Whedon has delivered and how. This is probably the most intense movie of the Avengers series. There are lot of characters and subtle subplots that you can relate to the comic book. They have made it in such a way that comic book fans are not disappointed as some of them were when they were trying to compare the first avengers with the comic series.

Without wasting too much time, The Avengers Age of Ultron gets straight to the point when they try to portray where the movie is leading to. Non comic book fans are introduced to new comic characters like Quicksilver and the Witch. However it is the role of Ultron, as a negative character which brings in a lot to the movie. Unlike the first part, this movie has a more intense antagonist in Ultron and James Spader with his immaculate voice makes sure of that. Also it is advisable to watch Captain America The Winter Soldier to relate to this movie more quickly. The action sequences are very intense, in fact more than half of the movie is filled with action and there is some space for wry humour as well. The Avengers was an unconventional superhero movie at that time by bringing in humour and sarcasm elements with the superhero genre. Age of Ultron is more old school with a lot of hero- villain-revenge-anger confrontations.

This time, there is more significance given to the 'science bros' chemistry between RDJ and Mark Ruffalo and it seems cool. Chris Hemsworth and Chris Evans quite easily continue to do their part. Scarlett Johansson is more sexy as Natasha Romanoff this time and Jeremy Renner has a meatier role. Elizabeth Olsen excels in some intensive scenes and Aaron Taylor Johnson does a good Russian accent. But Paul Bettany as Jarvis and a cold faced Vision is the standout.

Unlike the first part this movie needs more brains and get ready for an intensive Avenger ride.",9

"""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" is yet to be one of the best blockbusters of 2015!",22 April 2015,"One of the strengths of its' predecessor, ""The Avengers"", is how the makers managed to blend characters and action together, giving either excitement and emotional satisfaction. This time around, it is more ambitious than ever. So, does it work? Yes, it does.

Telling the plot would only spoil the experience. When I first watched the trailer, I knew nothing about it. All I know is there is a talking robot and mass destruction. Going in unprepared was totally the right choice that I made.

All I'm going to say is this; A:AOU is going to be one of the best movies in 2015. From the exciting opening to the thrilling finale, this bad boy will leave you breathless. Talking about breathless, the action was spectacular. It is on par with the first one.

The star-studded casts are amazing, as always. What I admire most is the screenplay. It makes the characters more... human. They are relatable than ever. The movie has some psychological depth that was not really fleshed out before.

Joss Whedon is really ""hit or miss"" and he missed it here badly. He's more of an Aaron Spelling than anything.

I guess if you want to say McDonalds makes great food because so many people eat it everyday, Joss Whedon is your guy.

The only character that seems remotely interesting is Tony Stark played by the brilliant Martin Downey Jr, if it wasn't for him the film franchise would simply not exist.

The movie is just a bunch of CGI that apparently is trying to break the record for how many machine fight scenes you can cram into a ""film""",3
Average Avengers,11 January 2016,"I've been quite happily ploughing through Marvel's 'shared cinematic universe.' I've never read a single Marvel comic, so I can't claim to say how faithful each movie is to its source material, but I just enjoy them anyway for what they are – good, popcorn-munching, special effects-fests. The original Avengers film was, in my opinion, about as perfect as it could be – it was the coming together of all the individual superheroes and it did it really well, giving each of them appropriate screen time. Therefore, what I'm trying to say is that I couldn't wait for 'part II.' Now I've watched it, I just feel a bit hollow. I didn't hate it, but it didn't leave half as much of a mark on me as the original. Again, the Earth's finest superheroes come together to fend off a new evil that's threatening to destroy the planet. In the first outing, the villain was Thor's nasty brother, Loki, played brilliantly by Tom Hiddleston. Soon after part II was announced we were informed that James Spader would be voicing the new baddie – the titular 'Ultron.' Now, James Spader is a great actor and more than capable of nailing the role as a comic book villain. However, he's only there in voice. His metal, robot character is completely computer-generated and I just didn't find him threatening enough (in the same way I didn't find 'General Grievous in Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith).

And that was pretty much my main gripe. The Avengers themselves were still pretty cool. There was banter between the central characters and – again – Robert Downey Jr was excellent as Iron Man. Plus there was a pretty awesome fight scene about half way through between two of the characters. So it wasn't all bad. In fact, it wasn't bad at all – just muted. It all felt a bit bland and simply going through the numbers of being an epic blockbuster.

All in all, it's an okay outing. I'm sure kids all over the world will love it and buy all the toys in the sequel's range. For me, the two Avengers films could be summed up by the fact that I could barely look away during the first one, but this one I found my mind wandering and tempted to check my mobile phone enough time.",7

"Almost completely soulless flash, bang, wallop",18 May 2015,"(53%) Could the original live up to all that build up in all those many, many films? Well it got close, but not quite as it was near impossible. So how does its sequel fair? Well instead of Thor having something to do with the world nearly ending this time it's old iron balls, but apart from that this is more or less a sliver of super simple plot stretched out for well over two hours. Because the story is so narrow and the length is so long this feels the need to stuff as much comic book based claptrap as possible meaning much will go over most people's head with things just sort of happing without any real logic. Oddly though this doesn't feel like a comic book of the screen, much more a video game with tons and tons of CG based action interrupted only by character interactions that feel more like cut scenes than actual parts of an actual movie. Much of what happens takes place in many different locations throughout the world, but there's so little sense of the vast distances between them that they may as well be in the very next room (or studio). Though with that said the good cast do attempt to bring something out, but there's so little substance that it's a losing battle (both Thor and captain America in particular do very little indeed besides fight robots). In terms of very basic entertainment this does the job, but in terms of anything deep, interesting, or memorable there's next to nothing to see here meaning the inevitable next entry really needs to get its act together otherwise the series has no future.",6

"Deep, dark, and a little horrifying.",3 May 2015,"Too many cooks? Not when Joss Whedon's concerned. Age of Ultron follows Assemble tidally, keeping Marvel's phase 2 films in tip top condition. Ultron has the comic edge, but now with added ambivalence and cloudiness. Think Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire compared to its predecessors. It's dark, convoluted and sometimes frightening. Not for the very young or the faint hearted. The Avengers work together effortlessly, whether its making dinner, friendly repartee or kicking ass. The hot-headed Bruce Banner (Ruffalo) and the seductive Black Widow's (Johansson) romance ignites, the Cap (Evans) and Tony Stark (Downey. Jr) clash often. Thor's (Hemsworth) hammer has just as much flare as he does and we see a side to Hawkeye (Renner) we've never seen before. Stark and Banner's AI product Ultron (voiced by the incredible James Spader) brings out the best and the worst in the Avengers. They unite to kill the unkillable, but sibling 'mutants' Quicksilver (Taylor Johnson) and Scarlet Witch (Olsen) stand in their way. Age of Ultron doesn't just develop important characters, it casts new ones, keeps the story interesting (albeit a little confusing) and manages to tease us with what's to come. Well done Joss Whedon, well done.

So much potential painfully untapped,29 May 2015,"This could and should have been the greatest of the marvel films released to date. The right ingredients, cast and characters combined with a director in theory who should understand the mythology behind the characters. It teased in the trailers a great villain to come along in quite a while. Menacing, creepy, intelligent and most of all Ruthless in its quest to destroy humanity. What we ended up with is a petulant child like robot who didn't really know what he wanted. Ultron was a wasted character and James spader was a wasted actor in this movie, as glorified a cameo as you can get. Notice I haven't talked about the plot or any of the other characters so far. I will get to that. I can't say I've followed the avengers comics too closely but I do get the general gist of this character in the few that I have read.

For me his weakness, the character direction ultimately led this film to fall flat for me. The film seem to concentrate too much on expanding the marvel universe with big name drops and visual signs at the behest of the story that was unfolding and the actual villain! It felt like he was nothing but a stepping stone for another character.

The other focused on character was Hawkeye, for some reason. There is one scene I will spoil but you'll understand why, it does not effect or have anything to do with the progress in story . They took this mysterious, albeit useless avenger/assassin and humanised a human character to the point of complete and utter weakness. He has a wife and children! How can he be so irresponsible and go out and fight super villains that could instantly kill him. Combine the standing around of the entire cast a bit of a time waste. Had whedon decided to trim the film he could have easily cut this scene out entirely and no one would have noticed. The whole thing was just out of place and one of the weaknesses that whedon has in his story telling.

The film is watchable, a retread as all superhero films are - mad Villain, Armageddon, save the day. It introduces us to the vision with a subtle change of origins. Even the birth of ultron was a origin change. It's not that it was done wrong, the whole thing was rushed and that's another issue with this film, everything is rushed to try and cram as much as possible into it. Maybe marvel is scared that the bubble has burst? People are tired of these films and this genre? No marvel we are not, so far you've done well, this being the first phase 2 film I hope isn't a sign of things to come.",6
An exhilarating experience showing off how far Marvel has come,28 April 2015,,8
Good but not great,26 April 2015,"I've seen the movie twice now, once in a near empty theater (first viewing) and once in a packed theater (second viewing). It was definitely a more enjoyable experience with a crowd to create some atmosphere.

This movie is good but not great. I definitely enjoyed the first Avengers movie and Guardians of the Galaxy more. The movie felt a bit flat because plot-wise it was very similar to the first movie - the evil villain messes with the team's minds to break up the team, but the Avengers inevitably regroup and save the day. Furthermore, Loki was a more interesting villain than Ultron.

While the sequel produced a few giggles, it lacks the laugh-out-loud moments of the first (except for one cracker from Hawkeye). There is also a within team romance that seems to have come out of nowhere and with little explanation as to why. Hawkeye gets by far the most character development of any of the Avengers, which made me think he was going to die at some point (no spoilers - I'm not saying he does or doesn't).

Unlike in Avengers 1, Hulk is notably absent from many of the major action sequences which I felt let the movie down, as Hulk was responsible for some of the best moments of the first movie.

In summary, it is a good popcorn movie, but unfortunately not as great as its predecessor.",7
Omg just watched it but ...,26 April 2015,,1
Worst superhero movie so far,22 August 2015,"I'm a big fan of the Avengers, Captain America, and Iron Man movie franchises, but everything about this particular movie sucked.

When the movie started immediately in ""action mode"" I had a suspicion that plot and character development were going to be thrown out of the window. When character after bland character gets introduced and then completely ignored (with some poor acting to boot, especially from the Olsen sister) my suspicions were confirmed.

I love James Spader but I don't think he was the right choice as the voice of Ultron. I'm not sure if it's his delivery or the poorly scripted and flat dialogue. What we're left with is a cookie cutter and powerless ""I'll get you next time!"" Gargamel caricature.

The only kind of character development I saw attempted was with Black Widow, but not as a person, instead as a romance. Ridiculous. Throughout the movies Black Widow has been treated as mere T&A in a body suit so trying to pour on a quick sob story in the context that now she wants love - it left an extremely bad taste in my mouth.

All in all extremely disappointing. Even more disappointing a lot of people ate it up with a spoon and seem to think this kind of movie is a 7! How!",
"A step down from ""Marvel's The Avengers""",1 May 2015,"A little disappointed with Avengers: Age of Ultron. I just saw it and my first impressions were that it was a step down from the first movie. ""Marvel's The Avengers"" movie had a good balance of story, action and character. And if we can compare other movies by Marvel, then ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" takes the cake. But, I digress.

This movie is a let down in a few ways for me. I'll try not to spoil anything, but I will say the first, and most of the second act were not quite as enjoyable as the third act. In the words of reviewer Gary Wolcott, it was ""High tech, high voltage action followed by long stretches of boring dialogue before more high tech, high voltage action."" The first act felt unwarranted and lazy. The third act was more fulfilling, but still very formulaic (as was the rest of the movie). The Avengers (SPOILER ALERT) go on yet another quest to save the world, as we have seen in one too many films before.

Joss Whedon has proved himself with things like ""Buffy"" and ""Marvel's The Avengers"", but unfortunately this film lacked the creative spark that it so desperately needed to set it apart from being just another sequel.

We can hope for a satisfying comeback in the following two-part films, but as with 4 part trilogies we know that part one is going to be excruciatingly lacking in any progress. The action is saved for part two, but that's a conversation for another day.",6

Avengers: Age Of Ultron does not disappoint,9 May 2015,"Avengers: Age Of Ultron is the best Marvel movie to date. While its run time is 2:12, it does not feel that long at all, in fact it felt like I was only in the theater for a fraction of the time. Right from the beginning we are treated to what Marvel does best, action sequences. The beginning of Ultron showcases each Avenger and each of their unique abilities in a way no one will forget. The movie is filled with humor, and you shouldn't leave the theater without having at least chuckled once or twice. The lulls in the movie are at a maximum only 10 to 15 minutes long each, then it sends you right back into the action. The whole movie keeps you on the edge of your seat and there is no shortage of good old Avengers fighting. The end is a bit similar to the end of the first Avengers in the sense that they are all fighting faceless enemies, but it doesn't hurt the movie at all. My only complaints about the movie would be the lack of screen time for both The Hulk and Ultron. The Hulk is one of my personal favorites, and while he is in one of the best scenes of the movie, it doesn't make up for the fact that he only has a maximum on 15 minutes screen time. Ultron, while he has more than 15 minutes, doesn't get enough time on screen to fully explain why hes doing what hes doing. While he briefly describes what his plan is and his motives, you are still left with only a very vague description. Ultron is such a cool villain you are left craving more of him, but sadly what we get is what we get. Over all i would give Avengers: Age of Ultron an 8/10. It is a great watch and one of the best movies of 2015 so far.",10

Poor engineer job,24 August 2015,"The thing most glaringly shown here is this, there is nothing real surrounding the making of such a film, it's not centered in commitment to anything; so the whole thing is size that commands attention and does nothing better with that attention than scatter it with slapdash noise.

It's one cg environment after another erupting around familiar faces in costume. It's kiddie stuff in the most simple sense; kids don't care how their playing amounts to a world, that's something that happens (or doesn't) as they make bumping noises.

Nothing here matters so when we get snark lest we take it too serious, that begs the question. What could we take serious here? People are shot with lasers and walk it off, a whole district is torn down as Iron Man and the Hulk duke it out but that's just the video game background. This was a main issue the Nolans pored over in their Bat work, how to create a world where choices have gravity.

The whole is bloodless (in the other sense), has no reality of any kind, no sense of world. It all crunches together every few minutes in heaps of plastic image, everything fake-looking. Faces, jokes, are crammed in but that's just more debris scattered about. Even the main dilemma in the story, about do we try to make everything safe or do we lose ourselves in the process is the exact same mechanical cog bandied around from one Marvel film to the other.

The Expendables is a nadir in worldbuilding these days as far as I'm concerned, this is close behind.",
Avengers: Tantrum of Ultron,5 May 2015,"When I first saw the trailer of this movie, I could not stop saying ""There are no strings on me."" I was so pumped that Whedon was back and the Avengers will take away the box office yet again. The trailer set us up for an amazing and chilling villain, a darker tone, a more serious threat, and the promise of darker things to come. However the end result was very disappointing.

There are some great moments the this movie gave. Whedon's script has some very deep and gripping dialog. The Hulkbuster fight was by far one of the greatest scenes in any of the MCU movies to date. There is some great foreshadowing to the films to come. Hawkeye gets some deserved characterization. We get to know more about Black Widow's past. Scarlet Witch is amazing, and Vision was jaw dropping. I also feel that Chris Evans truly shines as Captain America in this film more than any other, and it is great to see how much Iron Man has evolved.

However, when the credits are rolling you will most likely agree that the first one was much better. The original cut of this film was supposedly over 3 hours, and with the poor editing with this movie it clearly shows. While Whedon can juggle many characters into one film, it did not have the same effect as this one. The Thor side story seemed added in. Andy Serkis' part left us excited for his return in the Black Panther movie, but had little to nothing to do with the rest of the plot. The death of the character in this film was not with someone we cared for too much. The love story was forced and unnecessary. Nick Fury did not have to be there. This movie sets us up for Civil War, but does not have a tragic incident that would spark such an event. There were also too many jokes, this movie should have had a much darker tone, but it got Disneyfied and had clever quips that were not as funny as the ones in the first film. This film should have taken itself more seriously. And lastly my biggest issue with this film.

The MCU is not perfect the biggest issue they have is the villain. True they do have Loki, the Winter Soldier, Red Skull, Obadiah Stane, and the promise of Thanos. James Spader was a perfect choice for the voice of Ultron. The trailers led us to believe that this is the cold heartless villain that would tear the Avengers apart. But Ultron was severely underdeveloped and not menacing or chill- inducing at all. He had unexpected jokes, which does not belong to a cold, calculating, ruthless robot hell bent on saving the world by destroying, what he believes to be its greatest threat, humanity. James Spader was meant to play a villain that could rival that of Darth Vader and Hannibal Lecter, but he came off as childish and acted like a combination of Loki and Tony Stark.

While I don't think it is a terrible movie, it just could have been better. I hope that Marvel will give us the original 3 hour cut, and that could change my mind. But in the end, if we were to rank the MCU films this one would probably be on the lower half.",6
Age of Avengers (Spoilers),22 April 2015,,8
Consensus: A billion-dollar sequel that needs to scale itself down to reality.,9 May 2015,"Avengers: Age of Ultron is the Marvel Studio's movie equivalent to Hulk. It is big, fierce and green (translates to a lot of money), yet it is devoid of any real emotional component. The stakes are definitely higher as our favorite band of superheroes team up once again to take down another noteworthy adversary: Ultron. Unlike previous enemies in the MCU, the mischievous robotic creature voiced by James Spader, was created by error from the tasteful mind of Tony Stark. Ultron's inception was triggered by Dr. Banner's and Mr.Stark's dream of upholding world peace- well not exactly. Their ambitions were misplaced; when they decided to pursue the route of artificial intelligence and integrate it in Stark's already existent peacekeeping program (controlled by Jarvis). When things take a turn for the worse, Ultron misbehaves and chooses to go out on a bender to destroy mankind rather than protect it.

Now that we have established the premise, let me start my review. Comic-books are a strong source material considering we have the technological advances in filmmaking today- to reproduce our favorite characters with pinpoint accuracy. However, CGI or computer generated images, should be complementary to these Marvel films and should not dominate every facet of them. In Captain America: The Winter Solider, we discovered the promising new face of the MCU and the capabilities of Kevin Feige and his team to deliver great pieces of cinema- while using the everlasting IP (intellectual property) from Marvel comics. The movie was grounded in reality and the CGI did not overshadow the spy and political undertones present in the film. Fast- forward to the release of the Avengers sequel- expectations were high, the crowd wanted the same dark tone the trailers promised and expected Marvel to continue on the great path forged in Captain America: The Winter Soldier.

The Avengers are starting a dangerous precedent for upcoming blockbusters. Let me clarify what I mean- there will be a point in the near future where only a handful of directors or creative geniuses will be able to take these comic-book franchises further (by creating unique films). You can't just keep on increasing the stakes (CGI, scale, plot, enemies you get the picture) and expect people to pay to see the movie. Let's assume Captain America 2 was not directed by - the Ruso brothers. What would that signify for the MCU? Specifically, what would happen to the future blockbusters at Marvel Studios? People generally think that one director (or in this case a pair of directors) is not able to change Marvel's strong fan-base and that die-hard geeks will continue to surge into the theaters at every MCU film release. I strongly feel that at this stage - you need visionaries to take comic-book characters and revolutionize them. Otherwise, you will be left with films like Age of Ultron- a fun popcorn flick with a substantial lack of ingenuity.

Studios expect a return on investment just weeks after a blockbuster like Age of Ultron opens. This can put an extreme amount of pressure to succeed on the director- in this case, Joss Whedon. There is no magic formula to gross $1Billion Dollars at the box-office, however there are ways to increase your odds. One way is to hire a competent and shrewd individual such as Christopher Nolan- who will take a source material, re-imagine it and deliver a chef-d'oeuvre in the process. Nolan applied real world dilemmas we face in the 21st century (crime, corruption, identity-crises) and integrated them seamlessly into the script. That's how you get a Dark Knight. Marvel Studios definitely does a great job at trying to hire actors and directors that are more-than-qualified to be in the MCU- however their approach is becoming too mainstream.

Let me elaborate, they are recruiting guys like Joss Whedon- who despite knowing the comics well and having had directing credits in the past- is not a GENIUS VISIONARY. You need artists that are willing to take risks and create their own universe, not just the Marvel Universe- their personal vision for the film. For example: James Gunn tried doing just that with Guardians of the Galaxy and it turned out to become a sleeper-hit in 2014. Bottom-line, the films in the MCU need to be personal and cannot be controlled frame-by-frame by studio execs who have no artistic integrity and definitely do not have the talent necessary to release masterpieces.

In conclusion, Age of Ultron falls in the category of films that are not particularly memorable, and that's all that should be said about it. This is a bad indicator for Marvel- who wants to take this franchise into new dimensions (literally and figuratively). The lesson here: hire an average filmmaker and you get a mediocre product.",6

"Fight fight fight, talk talk talk. The Avengers Show. 65%",7 May 2015,"Not so much bigger and better than it's predecessor (which I scored 77.5% at this site) than bigger and worser. Presumably this movie is superhero action fanboy porn. If it succeeds on that level, it was more of a letdown for me. The first movie was quite funny and I remember enjoying it...even if I now don't remember much (or anything) of it.

So, here's why I think this movie isn't that good...personally, I can't imagine wanting to watch this movie again, even if it was passable entertainment. Perhaps - one day - I could return to watch the first Avengers movie but not this one: the entire movie is one frenetic fight scene after another and whilst being action-packed, it just didn't engage me at all. A sign of a good movie of this sort would be having characters that you feel for and revel in their heroics...you want to - ideally - be exhilarated and overjoyed by their derring-do. You want to cheer them. Literally. There's just no euphoria watching the action unfold. That just didn't happen for me. If the next movie in this series is similarly ""bigger and better"", I probably won't watch it. Already feel that it would take something special for me to continue watching this series (I never watched the second Thor movie, nor have I even seen one Captain America movie). Also, it seems that this movie features some characters from a TV series based on this universe...so...I had no idea who some of those people were. I n that way, perhaps, the movie presupposes too much knowledge (or interest) in some characters.

There are some vaguely interesting themes in this movie but it just doesn't feel like a good story. It feels more like a Readers Digest version of a story...as told by someone with ADD. That's the critical flaw of this movie...not a great story...just a lot of fighting, some talking and then some more fighting. And the fighting - whilst spectacular - isn't particular impressive as far as aesthetics go, or drama. Instead of good drama, you just get more bodies on the screen...fighting.

A positive of the movie is the incidental humour. It's not exactly quotably funny, but it's funny in a ""you had to be there"" kind of way.

A negative of the movie is the sometimes indecipherable dialogue from the main cast. Even though one character has an excuse of not having English as a first language (the female mind reader character...whatever she was called) , I was amused to think that she said to the villain of this piece (Ultron, towards the end of the movie): ""Do you know how to fart?"". Some later contextual vision gives me a better idea of what she said...but not much.

In this movie, stuff happens...that's all a bit silly. This would actually be a good movie to score purely on a ""pass""/""fail"" basis. It's a pass. That's all.

In some ways, this franchise is like the Iron Man franchise...starts off well, then peters out. I do think that I've seen all three (?) Iron Man movies though. Not sure if I'll stick with that one either.

Just by the by, I noticed in the end credits listings for Film Victoria and Australia, I think. Not sure why.",6
Great Sequel! Lives up to the Hype!,5 May 2015,"I have no clue why this movie is getting negative reviews! I don't know if comic nerds are slamming it because they feel like it wasn't following the comics or what, but I really enjoyed Age of Ultron. In fact, I believe it is as good or even slightly better than the first Avengers movie. Great action, special affects, and loved the introduction of the new characters the Scarlet witch and Quicksilver. Heck there is even a little romance in the movie along with the comedy. This is definitely the first block buster of the summer! I also will point out that it is one of those movies that you don't want to end because it is just so much fun to watch!!!",9

Cheap Snack,3 May 2015,"Here we are really near to the ""Phase 3"" of Marvel movies that leads to Infinity War in 2018 and 2019

I have to say that i really love the first Avenger movie because not only it's fun but it's also fill with amazing characters.

With that said though Avengers 2 is not like that , actually it's worse than the first Avengers.

Why ? because almost everything in this sequel is just exactly the same , the plot , the conflict or the characters , yes it's still fun popcorn movie to watch with great action scene BUT right now we are in the ""Avengers 2"" we should have more than just great action scene or mediocre characters or super cliché conflict.

and The worst part of the movie itself is it Villain ""Ultron"" he is just terrible trying so hard to be this super bad guy but not only he's super cliché but the movie just hype him to be this bad-ass character too much when what we saw now is that he's just another bad guy that just complain about everything and doing nothing , he could possibly be okay in stand-alone movie like Iron Man 4 but not in the Avengers , This is not even count the fact that Ultron in comic is actually really really powerful character while in the movie he fells boring and lackluster.

Overall Avengers: Age of Ultron fells mediocre at best everything is just exactly the same and sometimes even worse than the first Avengers or even Captain American: Winter Soldier a lot of thing fells like Marvel just keeping good stuff out of us too much for this ""Infinity War"" movies than will hit us in 2018 that is like 3 years from now and if this happen again and again i will probably be bored before this Infinity War movie happen.",6

Underrated movie. Great setup for the story.,24 March 2021,"In my opinion this movie as a standalone is very average, but it is setting up the story for Civil War, Black Panther, Ragnarok and the Endgame movies. Its full of easter eggs and your typical Marvel humor. As a fan of the MCU you will love it but you have to watch all MCU movies to fully understand the grand sceme.",9
"""Cap, I have to blow up the city!""",1 October 2015,"The Avengers bicker with each other while trying to battle Ultron, an artificial intelligence in a robot shell created by Tony Stark and Bruce Banner. Given the astronomical success of the first film, it was almost a certainty this sequel would pale by comparison. I did enjoy this one but I must admit it doesn't hold a candle to The Avengers, Winter Soldier, or any of the first solo movies that I liked so much. The main thing the first Avengers had going for it was the spectacle of these characters teaming up on screen for the first time. It was a delight for longtime fans and for those following the movies to see such a wonderful payoff. This doesn't have that going for it. It's the same set of characters, with a few new additions I actually liked more than some of the previous characters. James Spader provides the voice for Ultron and does a magnificent job of being both menacing and funny. Aaron Taylor-Johnson and lovely Elizabeth Olsen are very good as Pietro and Wanda Maximoff (aka Quicksilver and the Scarlet Witch), although their costumes are unimaginative. Paul Bettany, who has been providing the voice for Tony Stark's A.I. companion Jarvis in the previous movies, is upgraded to his own character here -- The Vision, who steals the movie as soon as he shows up.

As with the first Avengers, the character stuff is what makes this work. There's especially good material for Mark Ruffalo, Scarlett Johansson, and Jeremy Renner. With this cast and how well they mesh together, there's a ceiling on how bad this could possibly be and this, thankfully, doesn't approach bad at any time. Whedon's script, while still having some good lines and scenes, was a little unbalanced and doesn't have quite the punch he is capable of. The action set pieces aren't the most impressive I've ever seen (even within the Marvel films) but they are mostly entertaining and the final battle against Ultron and his robot army has some moments of greatness. One thing did bug me due to how frequently it happened -- how were the people who don't have superhuman strength punching and kicking metal that's stronger than steel without being hurt? A bit of nerdy hole-poking, perhaps, but it didn't make sense.

My experience watching this several months ago (and now rewatching it for the first time since) is very different from my experience with The Avengers. With the prior film, I was influenced by the massive hype and expectations to the point that it hurt my enjoyment of the movie the first go-round. I have since come to appreciate it much more and really just love it for the sheer fun that it is. This movie I found myself liking a lot upon first viewing but my second viewing found my opinion dropping quite a bit as I noticed a lot more of what was wrong with it. Look, it's an enjoyable movie but not as clever or fun as it should have been. Not the stinker some are making it out to be but definitely a bit of a disappointment.",6

Digital and sound effect extravaganza...,26 April 2015,"Do you remember the time you were child and you ate something good so much, that your stomach became sick? Can you still remember the time you got an idea which was too hard to execute? What about a time you promised to start exercise and finished it way before you started it? And do you remember that morning after when you had the worst hang over and you promised never again to drink that last beer and find yourself from pub with pint of lager next day? All those promises and movie Avengers, Age of Ultron combines the same thing. If you are not totally devoted you simply can't fulfil everything you promised to yourself. Avengers, Age of Ultron is like the promise you made. It is so stupid, that if you are not a total fan of series it is totally too much. At the same time it is so enjoyable to watch that you just can't stop watching it. There are simply too many characters that it is impossible to concentrate to tell a valid story. If you can enjoy two hours of effect rumble or if you are a total fan of Marvel comic book books you definitely can enjoy this movie. Avengers, Age of Ultron is just a turbo loaded action flick, nothing more or nothing less. I'm sure it will get it audience who are willing to pay the price of a movie ticket. As long as people do this you will get what you want. But one day, I am sure, some studio will fall from sky and hard, when people won't find these digital effect rumble any more satisfied enough. If you can enjoy enough of great digital effects without a decent story, you will find this very satisfying. If you need even a little use for your brain it is smart to avoid this movie.",6
good,26 March 2020,"Generally speaking, it didn't reach the first experience that I wanted to make people feel right away. Both funny and flaming are not enough, which should be the weak law of the sequel movie. The appearance of many characters is dazzling, but they are still distinct. Jarvis and Vison are amazingly fit, and there are not many twins. The emotional drama of widow and Hulk is the softest moment. The existence of Ultron is slightly lower. Not fierce enough, the captain swears Thor Thor hammer joke throughout.",8

An action film lacking a story,18 May 2015,"With Joss Whedon at the helm, and a slew of big box office draws playing virtually every character, this had the making of the movie of the century. But like the Pacquiao-Mayweather fight that took place on the same night this film premiered, it was anything but. The mythology in this film was poorly explained and detracted from enjoying the movie. The characters did not arc and some of them seemed to acquire new powers or develop new back stories when the plot suited. The film demanded you suspend your disbelief but did not even do the audience the service of putting together a plausible plot line. Even the mega-evil villain of the film was really just a misguided automaton that probably could have seen the error of his ways with a long, frank discussion about his intended course of action. Though the fight sequences were fun and unique, there were too many characters to follow. Without a reason to care about the characters, the audience cannot be expected to care for the outcome, in which case, the film will disappoint.",4
No real story plot here,19 October 2015,"I was disappointed with Avengers: Age of Ultron. There is no real story here. The trailers pretty much reveal all you need to know. Stark does something wrong, the AI Ultron comes to life, and he fights the Avengers. He fights them here, there, everywhere. He enlists help too. Ho hum. The fighting went on and on and on. There is an attempted plot line with Natasha and Banner, and a plot line with Hawkeye, and a small one with Thor, but really, nothing here to get excited about.

I guess the word is - boring. Despite all the fighting, this film is just boring. You keep waiting for something to happen. when something does happen at the end, I don't know, I wasn't worried. This is Hollywood after all - they have a franchise to keep going. So do you ever think the Avengers will lose? That knowledge alone makes all this fighting moot because you know who will win.

The actors I think are starting to get either bored themselves, or jumping ship. No Gweneth Paltrow, no Happy Hogan. Hawkeye has a message too. Seems like Chris Evans is starting to get too old for his youthful Cap. And we thought we'd seen the end of Iron Man, yet here he was again.

At the end in Credits, you learn, oh, here's that guy, so the future portends yet another Avengers movie. Please give this one a plot with a real story where you don't know what is going to happen. That would possibly re-energize the actors and the customers because this one just was average at best.",6

The Age of Super Heroes vs. Super Villains,24 April 2015,"Seems like the plan is set. First decide on a crazy villain. He wants to conquer earth/universe or destroy everything. Then design heroes to fight them. If there is only one or two heroes keep things simple- say 10 henchmen and a simple device of destruction and finally save the save world. If there are a handful of heroes, then throw in a zillion henchmen, up the ante with technical mumbo-jumbo, and if possible kill a character along the way (appealing to emotions apparently), and save the world anyway. Oh. Write in some dialogues on the issue of right vs. wrong. And with many characters around the focus is not anymore about what is right or what is wrong but rather who is right and who is wrong.

In India, the audience might watch avengers and say ""Full Paisa Vasool""(recovered my money) but the movie makers are saying ""Fool!! Paisa Vasool"". I am just plain angry that all these high budget movies offer nothing that wants us to revisit movies. All they offer is a one time watch spectacle.

And that is where I keep falling for the bait every time. Marvel is spectacular at spectacles! They openly declare that they are serving us junk food and they make the junk so delicious that we are willing to forgive them for not making it one bit healthy. And that is where Marvel has so far got it right. They understand that mixing junk with healthy stuff neither gets the taste right nor the health. And I watch marvel films for my dose of no holds barred junk. And Age of ultron is finger licking good!!

Would definitely recommend a one time watch.",6
EVERYONE CREATES THINGS THAT THEY DREAD,21 November 2018,,9
Did they forget to edit the film?,24 April 2015,"Thankfully we have Daredevil to be grateful for already, which softens the blow that is Avengers: Age of Ultron.

There were some nice moments in the film I could appreciate but these elements are spoiler filled. The CGI was dreadful in the first act. I had my hands covering my face in shock at how bad it looked (and I watched this in '2-D'). The one liners were cringe-worthy and they just kept on coming.

The bad reviews were generally justified. This film is a mess. By no means another Iron Man 3. There wasn't so much an issue with the story they wanted to tell, rather the way it was told. If you weren't up for it Joss Whedon, I'd have respected you more to pull out instead of making this average at best blockbuster flick.

2014 was an amazing year for Marvel, with James Gunn and the Russo Brothers bringing refreshing new elements to the franchise. Let's hope they can pick up where they left for Phase 3.",6
A true super hero team,5 November 2018,Review: I really enjoyed this movie because it shows you the giant egos within the avengers and what team work actually takes to balance it all out. The direction is really good. The screenplay is really good. The casting is incredible and so is the acting. The acting is incredible no one actor really stands out which is really good from a ensemble perspective. It is really cool to add to the ensemble by adding the voice of James Spader. All in all I would give this five out of a possible five stars.,10
Not as entertaining as The Avengers,26 April 2015,"Plus Points : The big star cast of Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr), Captain America (Chris Evans), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson),The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) are the biggest attractions for the film and they have done their part. A nice new romantic thread involving The Hulk and Black Widow delivers some of the best moments in the film. There are lots of action sequences and tons of robots flying around in the movie. Fans of these sequences will be thrilled. The Iron Man vs Hulk battle has been shot well.

Minus Points : The movie has no soul. There is no riveting screenplay to back up the action. In Avengers part 1, the action had a great subplot and the pace was fantastic. In this edition of the Avenger, that is missing. The main thread of Ultron going rogue is very old and predictable. In fact,The strategy employed by Ultron for earth's destruction is not very effective in terms of shock value. The length of the movie becomes painfully obvious after a point and there is nothing much to hold your attention. Even the climax fight is not 'Avengers' worthy.

and in technical aspects - Special Effects team did a very nice job and the graphics work in the movie is top notch. You can't make out any artificial shots even if you try hard. 3D effects are just about OK. Background music complements the scenes well. Joss Whedon's direction is a bit of a hit and miss. Some scenes are nice but the overall movie lacks the soul of the original. Avengers Part one was almost a masterpiece when it comes to packaging a superhero film. This is not the case here.

My verdict:- avengers : Age of Ultron is a decent film but it is not a worthy sequel to 'The Avengers'. It is not as entertaining and that is the biggest flaw of this film. There are action scenes that will satisfy hardcore fans. Watch it with very low expectations.",7
"Fell a Bit Short of My Expectations, but It's a Decent Sequel",27 March 2016,"I am an unabashed fan of THE AVENGERS. I understand it has its flaws, particularly in the pacing, but I paid my money for a geek spectacle and that's exactly what was delivered. I count it as one of the best comic book movies, up there with THE DARK KNIGHT. Now that we've gotten a sequel, I expected more. I held AGE OF ULTRON to a higher standard. We've already had the big action bonanza but watching Iron Man, Captain America, and the rest of the crew together on the big screen has been done and it's not enough to carry my interest this time around. The promotional materials made it out to be the darker, edgier sequel with repercussions to the heroes' actions and, though it might be clichéd, an EMPIRE STRIKES BACK vibe. Well, it came close but fell short. I still enjoyed AGE OF ULTRON but I walked out of the theater with a resigned shrug, muttering ""It was all right."" As the film opens, the Avengers are well established and in the midst of an assault on a Hydra base in the country of Slokovia. We're introduced to ""the twins"", Hydra's genetically-enhanced ace up its sleeve: Pietro (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and Wanda (Elizabeth Olsen) Maximoff. Or, as comic fans know them, Quicksilver and the Scarlet Witch. Following their success in Slokovia and the reacquisition of Loki's scepter, Tony Stark gets the wild idea to incorporate the scepter's alien ""programming"" into his proposed artificial intelligence program, Ultron, in hopes of creating an automated Earth defense. It works too well, and Ultron becomes sentient with plans of protecting the Earth in the most efficient means possible: eradicating its pesky human infestation.

Once again, the Avengers biggest opponent is pacing. At nearly 2.5 hours, this is a big movie, packed to the brim with action and plot. The main issue I see is that since half of the characters aren't getting standalone movies (Black Widow, Hawkeye, and the Hulk) we're trying to cram their personal story elements into a movie that should be focused on the whole ""sentient robot intent on destroy human life"" bit. Whereas the first movie ground to a halt following the assault on the Hellicarrier so the characters could mourn their loss and regroup for the final climactic battle, AGE OF ULTRON does the same with a stint at a ""safe house"" where we show the human side to being part of a hero team. Interesting concept to be explored in a superhero film, but probably not the best time right now. You want to give a romantic subplot to Bruce Banner and Natasha Romanoff? Fine. Do it in a Hulk and/or Black Widow movie. Iron Man, Captain America, and Thor each have their own film series to get the minutiae out of the way so that, when we get the band back together for a big show, we can incorporate elements of their individual struggles without stopping the main story thread to build on them further. When you've got this amount of bigger than life characters (and cast) sharing the screen, we need to be economical in how we spend that 2.5 hours. I mean, AGE OF ULTRON feels like it's equally part Hawkeye/Jeremy Renner apology for turning him into a mind-controlled zombie in the first film. We're treated to extra backstory for the character and he gets some extra time in the spotlight for action and zingers.

I'm also a little tired of the big action spectacle finale. It was awesome in THE AVENGERS because it was our first time seeing all these major characters fighting side-by-side on the big screen. So sure, whatever, give me a half hour final battle with the Avengers wiping out an invasion of faceless alien enemies. In the sequel, I expect a little more creativity. And what did we get? A half hour final battle with the Avengers wiping out an invasion of faceless robot enemies. Look, I love watching the Avengers crush the villain and their faceless CG army as much as the next fan but I wouldn't mind changing things up a bit. These guys are more than fists. Let's get a problem for the Avengers that isn't easily resolved by smashing wave after wave of baddies. I absolutely loved the first half of this movie, where the Avengers are faced with an enemy they aren't prepared to encounter. Not Ultron (as much as I loved the character) but the Scarlet Witch. She gets into their heads and uses their fears and concerns against them, attacking them on an emotional level and sending them to whimper in the corner. Or, if you're the Hulk, rampaging through an unsuspecting downtown metropolis. Wanda/Scarlet Witch was an awesome addition to the character roster for the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Olsen does a phenomenal job giving her a physicality to her ""spell-casting"" and an innocence to counter her brother's angry freedom-fighter persona. I'm not 100% sold on her eastern European accent yet, but it's not distracting. Johnson's Quicksilver doesn't steal the spotlight as Evan Peters did in Fox's DAYS OF FUTURE PAST but he does a fine job with minimal material. Really, I think Quicksilver is only here because they wanted to bring in Scarlet Witch and figured it was a package deal. Another excellent addition is the Vision, who's involvement in the film is pretty important to the plot so I won't go into the how's and why's but I will say I was most excited to see him brought to the franchise. Very, very cool to bring in the Vision.

AGE OF ULTRON isn't a bad movie but it doesn't rise above and beyond THE AVENGERS as I hoped it would. It's got some excellent material in there and some obvious fan service to get us cheering. It loses steam once we hit the safe house but you can tell they were trying to go bigger this time around. They still just working out the kinks.",7
lets be honest...,1 May 2015,"i have read some reviews - i understand kids and people that blindly like everything with Marvel written on it rate it as ""Amazing 10/10 best movie ever""...

but honestly those who like movies and comics, lets respect ourselves a little and admit that WE DO NOT WANT THE THIRD AVENGERS MOVIE TO BE LIKE THIS - predictive formula-type ""movie""(?) where everything is clear after you see the trailer.

OK special effects are great but do we really need this? would you rather prefer interesting, involving story which makes you think and discuss with friends afterwards even without these many special effects or you want a bunch of explosions where you just brainlesly sit and become more and more dumb after a series of interchanging cheesy jokes? I hope this movie will become a wake up call for those who made it.

If this movie will be treated as a ""standard of perfection"" to other movies as according to many comments here, then it will be very sad.",4

ULTRON!,13 March 2023,"Avengers: Age of Ultron, directed by Joss Whedon, is an action-packed superhero film that brings together Earth's mightiest heroes as they face off against a new threat, an AI named Ultron, who seeks to destroy humanity.

The film's ensemble cast, including Robert Downey Jr. As Iron Man, Chris Evans as Captain America, and Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow, deliver strong performances and have excellent chemistry. James Spader's portrayal of the villainous Ultron is also a standout, adding depth and complexity to the character.

The film's cinematography and special effects are impressive, with thrilling action sequences and stunning visuals that bring the superheroes' powers to life. The film's use of practical effects and motion capture also adds to its immersive quality.

The film's plot, while at times convoluted, is well-paced and engaging, with themes of responsibility and teamwork that give the film emotional weight. The film's humor and banter between the characters add a sense of fun and charm, making it a crowd-pleaser for audiences of all ages.

However, some may criticize the film for its lack of focus and overstuffed plot, as well as its treatment of its female characters, who can feel sidelined and underdeveloped.

Overall, Avengers: Age of Ultron is a thrilling and entertaining superhero film that delivers on its promises of epic action and fun banter between its characters. While it may not be perfect, it's a must-see for fans of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and a testament to the genre's popularity.",8
A fun ride..,3 May 2015,,6
Good but.....ehhhh.. still has flaws- End of superhero age?,29 May 2015,"Note I still gave this a 8/10. Why it doesn't live up to the hype it still a fun movie. This is not a bad film as it has a lot of strong moments in it, but there is still work to be done.

Joss Whedon is a god among men and knows characters well, but that doesn't translate when you have as many as this does and it is not a series. And that is just the issue here Whedon. If this was a TV show it be the best show ever, but it isn't so writing it like one makes it feel so cramped.

The story in this not to different from the first Avengers movie. It is still simplistic. Ultron wants to blow up the world, the Avengers try to stop him. That's all the audience ever really knows about this story. Same as how The Avengers wanted to fight Loki and defeat him.

As I said Joss Whedon needs to go back to TV. The character development was so packed in with this film. It is like you were trapped in a box you couldn't get out of. And while some moments were great between the characters not all of them were as fleshed out. The romance was stale and random, and didn't feel authentic. It just became a plot device

That being said the character development is were the movie shines. I came out this movie liking every Avenger. Thor, Black Widow, Hulk, Captian America, Iron Man, Hawkeye, Scarlet Witch,and Quicksilver all were developed to the point were you could love each and every one of them. Compare that to the last Avenger movie were Iron Man and the Hulk took all the glory and came out being the only ones we cared about.

Sadly we all have to look at the box office and reception this movie got and as a nerd realize this may be the end of another superhero age or the beginning of it. Marvel has failed the non comic book readers and made them feel alienated. It has a cinematic universe idea which at first was brilliant has instead begun to fall and that hurts. I want people to love comic book movies and I would love it even more if these comic book movies could help people wanna go out a read a comic book, but this seems like a movement to a dark age. If Marvel doesn't change, ad if Kevin Feige doesn't make a decision to find a balance between the lightheartedness and the darker scenes we will see a day when the comic book era would have to be rebooted again.",8
An Explosive Sequel To A Seemingly Unbeatable Cultural Phenomenon,4 May 2015,"The superhero movie has become a cultural juggernaut blown way out of proportion. Since ""Iron Man"" debuted in 2008, our days, months, and years have thrived off of an anticipatory thirst for the latest action-packed face-off. In the space of seven years, we've been consumed by eleven different ""Avengers"" blockbusters, some introductions, some sequels, some forgettable, all fun. For such silly movies, they have been blessed to have been directed by some of Hollywood's most brilliant minds (Joss Whedon, Kenneth Branagh, Shane Black, Jon Favreau), in the process piecing together an array of junk foods that inexplicably taste healthy. It's a wonder that a feeling of repetition is not the first thing on everyone's mind – how many times can clever supers defeat a seemingly unbeatable foe? – but then again, it's a wonder that the majority of superhero movies, ones of the last decade, that is, have been so, so, so ... pardon my generality, good. Blast ""Iron Man 2"" for its flatness, insult ""Thor: The Dark World"" for its monotonous action (I did neither, by the way); fact is, there has not been a straight-up dud in this apparently never ending franchise.

""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" is further evidence of a billion-dollar machine that won't be breaking down any time soon. Surely, nothing will top its world-stopping predecessor or 2014's impeccably enthralling ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"", but the infectious high that comes along with our favorite superheroes getting together for a quasi-madcap hoedown is unlike any other. Take for instance, a scene in which the heroes are chilling over drinks at Tony Stark's (Robert Downey Jr.) maximalist pad, all attempting to lift Thor's (Chris Hemsworth) hammer with bloated confidence. It's a moment of comedic delight that melts our faces off. It's too much. We've learned to love these characters over the years, and by now, they're the fictional BFFs we never knew we'd have. The creators of these films, especially Whedon, have crafted a near perfect balance between witty repartee and mind-blowing action sequences (sound effect and all).

""AOU"", though, takes a turn hardly felt by these epics. It makes the characters – I can't believe I'm writing this cringe-worthy line – more *** human *** than ever. It gives Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) a wife (Linda Cardellinli) and kids. Delves into Black Widow's (Scarlett Johansson) psychologically scarring childhood. Taps into Captain America (Chris Evans) and Thor's longing for a past when things weren't so vastly deterred by city/state/country/world destroying masterminds. And, not to mention, ""AOU"" spends much of its length showing them defeated, distraught over the titular villain's nearly indestructible prowess. As usual, we know that our favorite good guys will eventually win the fight against our new favorite bad guy (apologies to villainous staple Loki) – but ""AOU"" works so well because its figures aren't going through the motions like they normally do. They're more insecure and tired than ever. They'll be back for more adventures, but remaining their energetic young selves might start to become an unavoidable obstacle course of willingness.

This time around, The Avengers are back to take down an extremely personal baddie. Personal because he's the result of Tony Stark's attempt to bring artificial intelligence to life. Personal because this A.I., also known as Ultron (voiced by a slippery James Spader), was programmed to protect humanity but believes that salvation comes in the form of extinction and rebirth. Long story short, Ultron, with silky braininess to back himself up, wants to destroy the world. He views destruction as a scientific phenomenon that needs to occur for the sake of evolution, explaining his plans like a level-headed chemist instead of a robot that, robot voiced, must ... destroy ... human ... race. He manipulates a pair of Russian twins with fantastical powers as his sidekicks, the lightning fast Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor- Johnson) and the telekinetically charged Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen). In comparison to the mighty Ultron, Loki and his posse seem like featherweights; Ultron's strategically strong actions, paired with Quicksilver's ability to literally beat enemies to the punch and Scarlet Witch's talent to influence the minds of her opponents, nearly knocks The Avengers down, both physically and mentally.

The best thing about ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" is that it doesn't much feel like a sequel, rather a continuation of the series of films we've all, admittedly, watched more than once. There's no need to explain motives, the current situation, or, really, any background information – the film knows that we're aware of what's at stake, and so it goes right into the meat, skipping slimming appetizers altogether. It begins with a bombastic action sequence and never slows down. There are more moments of reflection and quiet than ever, making ""AOU"" the most thoughtful ""Avengers"" movie yet, but even then, power radiates from its writing, acting, and directing. It's more than professionally executed action; it's quality entertainment. These characters could easily be in a drama where there are no Shakespearian villains to defeat, and they would remain interesting. By tapping into what really makes them tick, ""AOU"" is, by far, the most personal two-and-a-half hours in any of these characters' on-screen lives.

But don't expect things to slow down. The climax, which sees a city lifted up hundreds of feet into the air by Ultron, is hugely exciting, and the brawls, work and play, are bigger and better. If ""AOU"" was released years ago, it might have read as being ridiculously refreshing. Nearly a decade later, it's just another spectacular addition to a culturally significant series.

Joss should really go back to TV,3 May 2015,,7
"Boring, No story only Non sense action",9 May 2015,"If you want to watch a movie with no plot, a huge set of actors who all get to say one line each, one by one and just non sense action, then this movie is for you.

I am a big fan of comic book movies. I love movies like Iron Man or Winter Soldier. I was looking forward to this movie for a long time. However, this movie just had no plot at all. I am glad I saw this for free, complete waste of time though. I really hope Marvell focus on building a plot and try to create a story.

I also don't understand why they keep adding more characters. Now they have too many characters with too little focus. If this is the future of avengers, then I guess I need to stop watching these.",1
"Riotously entertaining, but Marvel need to change their formula",8 May 2015,"With the Marvel Cinematic Universe growing increasingly larger every year, returning director Joss Whedon was faced with an even more monumental task than he did in 2012 with The Avengers, the movie that finally brought together the superhero collection of huge personalities united by one goal, but each wanting to go about it in their own way. Each standalone film has developed key supporting players necessary to the character whose name is on the poster, and with The Avengers' climax allowing its Earthlings to gaze into a wormhole and last year's Guardians of the Galaxy unleashing aliens a-plenty, Marvel's world has truly become a universe.

The last time a director returned for a Marvel sequel, we ended up with Jon Favreau's Iron Man 2 (2010), a messy let-down of a film that lacked invention, to the point that it felt like the guy behind the camera had lost all interest by the end. In a way, Age of Ultron suffers from some of the same problems. Like all Marvel films, it pits it's leads against a 'new threat', climaxing with a battle in the air that features lots of punches, blasts and quips. But for all it's narrative familiarity, Whedon still finds new ways for his heroes to batter their opponents, keeping the jokes fresh and genuinely witty, and ensuring the ragtag, flawed bunch are always eager to be at each other throats (quite literally - I think every character is grabbed by the throat at some point).

Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is still suffering from nightmares and flashbacks of his journey through the wormhole and seeing the threats lurking amongst the stars. He and the Avengers, now led by Captain America (Chris Evans), attack the Hydra outpost of Baron von Strucker (Thomas Kretschmann), the monocled Nazy glimpsed at the end of Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014) in possession of Loki's scepter. Von Strucker's defences are useless when faced by the Avengers, but that is until he unleashes the twins Pietro (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen); the former possessing super-speed, and the latter able to enter people's mind and unleashing their darkest fear. When Wanda screws with Stark, he sees his friends dead, powerless to stop it. She is like the ultimate bum acid trip.

After retrieving the scepter, Stark and Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) discover an artificial intelligence hidden inside, and use it to kick-start the Ultron program, an independent-thinking army of robots designed to protect Earth from any threats, allowing the Avengers to retire in the process. But Ultron (wonderfully voiced by James Spader), having consumed huge amounts of data through the internet within seconds of being activate, concludes that the only way to save the planet is to eliminate the one's responsible for slowly destroying it - humanity. Upon discovering what Stark has created, Captain America and Thor (Chris Hemsworth) are furious. And so are the public, who are terrified with the amount of carnage taking place around them as Ultron journeys to Africa in search of vibranium, the near-invincible metal that will allow him to create the ultimate body.

On top of the character's already mentioned, the Avengers also consist of Scarlett Johansson and Jeremy Renner. Add to the mix the returning Don Cheadle, Anthony Mackie, Samuel L. Jackson, Cobie Smulders, Hayley Atwell, Stellan Skarsgard, Idris Elba and Paul Bettany - who appears in the flesh for the first time as the Vision - as well as newcomers Linda Cardellini and Andy Serkis, and you have one hell of a hefty line- up. Whedon has juggled large ensemble's before with the tragically cancelled Firefly and it's follow-up movie Serenity (2005), as well as the first Avengers, but he has a noticeably weaker grip on his cast this time around. It jumps from one action scene to another, slightly smothering the quieter scenes in between, failing to allow them to breathe and flow.

The one exception involves a welcome retreat for the Avengers, who choose to lay-low at Hawkeye's (Renner) humble abode after causing more chaos with Ultron. Clearly feeling guilty at the shoddy deal Hawkeye got last time around, who spent most of the movie controlled by Loki, Whedon has finally made him interesting. He acknowledges his inferiority when compared an unstoppable green monster and the God of Thunder, and even comments on the lunacy of fighting off an army of killer robots with a bow and arrow. His warm relationship with his wife (Cardellini) and his children, as well as his various personal face-off's with Pietro, provide a human connection in the midst of a 90 year-old super soldier and a millionaire playboy genius.

With Marvel's Phase Three almost upon us (once Ant-Man is finally released later this year), Age of Ultron was always in danger of being little more than a stepping-stone to what's to come. Yet although it certainly hints at upcoming characters (the fictional country of Wakanda, home of the Black Panther, is mentioned) and future events (Thor is troubled by his Wanda-induced apocalyptic visions, which are to take place in Thor: Ragnarok (due 2017)), it also moves the story forward and evolves its characters. Marvel certainly needs to change its formula though (the paranoid thriller twist on The Winter Soldier was a stroke of genius); the smash-heavy climaxes have become tired. Ultron is also not really the threat he was set-up to be, but he's utterly electric when on screen, Spader providing a biting wit to his growls. It is far for perfect, and inferior to its predecessor, but riotously entertaining throughout.",6
Avengers: Age of Ultron,24 August 2021,"Excellent movie I really enjoyed watching, the movie was less than the level of the first part but it is still an amazing movie, the villain of the movie was excellent, the quicksilver character was not up to the standards,",8
Avengers Age of Ultron: My Thoughts,1 May 2015,"I want to start this review by saying that if you liked The Avengers, or just Marvel films in general, then I highly doubt you're going to dislike this film. It's not a departure, a change from the norm, or anything of that nature. Having said that, there are distinctions between Age of Ultron and its predecessor that make this a slightly different viewing experience.

In The Avengers there were never any introductions. We were thrust into the plot of the film almost immediately. This is because The Avengers was a sort of culmination-sequel of films that had already been made. We'd already seen Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, Bruce Banner, Black Widow, Hawkeye, and Nick Fury from their respective franchises. We'd even met the main villain (Loki) before, which left no burden of introductions upon Joss Whedon's shoulders.

This form of freedom allowed the Avengers to get straight to the point and clip along very fluidly and efficiently. The result was one of the best comic book movies of all time. This time around, however, there were introductions. We saw four new main characters in Age of Ultron, all of which we'd never seen before (save for a cameo appearance by the Maximoff twins in Winter Soldier).

Unlike The Avengers, that began without a prologue and without delay, there's a fairly lengthy prologue in Age of Ultron. It is here that the plot is set up, and three of the new characters are introduced. There's a fairly lengthy scene in this portion of the film that drags noticeably. It's a much slower-paced intro to the one we experienced back in 2012.

Again, in the film's second act, we encounter another slow-paced, longer than necessary scene that leaves the viewer hanging. It is these interruptions in the plot that both ruin the fluidity that we saw in The Avengers, and contributes to Age of Ultron's 141 minute run time. Instead of the tasty nugget we savored in The Avengers, we now have something far more chewy, which isn't necessarily a bad thing.

The upside of this is that the plot is far more developed and more intricate than the first film. There are a lot more twists and turns and a lot more questions asked and answered. This is the thing I really like about Age of Ultron; I was far more intrigued and absorbed by the plot than I was in the original.

But plot isn't everything; there are also character interactions and character arcs that need to be weighed in. In The Avengers I felt like the character interactions were perfect. It was far more entertaining and interesting to see the Avengers fight and engage in banter with each other, than it was to see the arbitrary 'Avengers vs Chitauri' battle sequences (don't get me wrong, I loved the last battle scene).

Here in Age of Ultron, however, it's mostly just the Avengers vs Ultron. There's a grand total of two scenes where the Avengers fight amongst each other, and it's very toned down and civil compared to its predecessor. There's still no shortage of one-liners and comical dialogue, however. Less than The Avengers, but still plentiful as ever.

The acting was solid, even from Aaron Taylor-Johnson. I have to say, I was worried about him, given his history in film, but even he was decent in this. Elizabeth Olsen was awesome as Scarlet Witch. That's all I'll say about that.

And then we have Ultron. James Spader was obviously the perfect choice for the role, but honestly he played it much differently than I thought he would. Ultron is about as nutty as can be. He's not the coherent mastermind we're used to seeing, but rather a raving, muttering lunatic with an incredibly twisted ideology. That said, he's probably my favorite Marvel villain to date.

Of course, with all Marvel films, it all comes down to the final battle sequence. Age of Ultron winds down in epic fashion. In comparison to the final battle in The Avengers, I have to say I liked this one a bit more. Not because it was epic, but rather because the imminence of Earth's demise was much more prominent. The Chitauri just didn't feel like a match for the Avengers, but Ultron's master plan seems quite insurmountable and quite threatening in comparison.

Overall, I left my theater satisfied. I didn't expect Age of Ultron to exceed its predecessors, and it didn't. But, nonetheless, it was a worthy sequel and one that I enjoyed immensely. It had just enough humor and just enough darkness to balance out in the end, and I would see it twice just for the thrill.",7
Avengers: Age of Ultron - 9.2/10,23 March 2024,"1. Overall Plot - 10/10 This is really the only movie that we see the Avengers all together for the entire movie. I love how they are the cause of Ultron. He is a very cool villain. And the introduction of Quick Silver and Scarlett Witch is very cool. It is full of action packed exciting scenes, and great plot points.

2. Entertainment / Engagement - 10/10 This movie is very entertaining. Watching all the Avengers interact as a team for the whole movie was fun to watch.

3. Emotion / Investment in Story - 4/10 There isn't anything emotional in this. They try very hard to push some Natasha and Bruce emotions together, but it comes out as very cringey. You do gain some attachment which causes some emotions.

4. Theme and Depth of Story - 8/10 The theme of this one is trust and teamwork. When they don't tell each other everything they kind of fall apart. And they have to learn to trust each other to defeat the threat.

5. Characters - 10/10 Ultron is very cool. He is a great villain. And Tony creating him is very cool. The introduction of Vision is cool too. And they handled it very well. The Maximoff twins are cool. They couldn't do it super accurate to the comics due to rights at the time, but they did a great job with it nonetheless.

6. Acting / Writing - 9/10 All the actors were great. No complaints. Ultron's voice actor was great for him. And I love Aaron-Taylor Johnson as Quicksilver. He did so good, and I wish we got more of him. What is keeping this from being a ten is Mark Ruffalo and Scarlett Johansson. They are both just very cheesy and not very good in this.

7. Cinematography - 10/10 This movie is noticeably beautiful. It has lots of cool shots that are filmed amazingly.

8. Score - 10/10 The Avengers music is awesome.

9. Editing / Pace - 10/10 Good editing and pacing.

10. VFX/Practical Effects - 8/10 Pretty good for the most part. There was a few parts, mostly at the beginning, that the the CGI looked kind of cheesy.

Average Score: 8.9/10

My Overall Rating and Final Thoughts: 9.2/10 I love seeing all the Avengers working together as a pre established team. It is very entertaining to watch them interact with each other.",9
"Fun, fast, and imaginative, but not heart-pounding.",1 May 2015,"Well, First let me state that I am not a comic fan boy, but Iam a huge Whedon fan. I went into this with high expectations, and the action, scope, visuals, sound, and writing (maybe one too many one-liners) fulfilled all expectations. I was bummed by three things that are the caused of my below excellent rating. The performances aren't knocked out of the park, and are kind of distant. No one really struggled to act. I think the actor giving the best performance was Spader and his character is all CGI. Probably think with Guardains being so praised last year, this movie was edited to work on that pace, which works great for James Gunn. But I welcome more development with Whedon written characters and sets. so when these people stand in a room, its not filled rhetoric, there ought to be great ideas and explanations. Thirdly (not a spoiler because these appearances were listed in credits) there were so many secondary characters from other films that appear but are hardly used that I just go, stop it already. But ya know. Whedon and along with Nolan, Wright, and Tarantino seem tapped into not just what movies are today but where they are going.

And its hard to see the trailer for Ant-Man before it and not be bummed that Edgar Wright left the project",6

Run-of-the-mill superhero movie - a disappointing and unworthy sequel to The Avengers (2012),2 June 2015,"In my opinion, The Avengers (2012) was one of the best movies ever. If you disagree with me, you are an idiot.

I watched The Avengers (2012) while on a plane and deeply regretted not watching it in a cinema instead, because it was so focking awesome. After landing, I got a digital copy of it (through entirely legal means of course) and watched it about 10 times within a two- week span. I ALSO proceeded to watch ALL the previous MCU movies, none of which came close to being as awesome as The Avengers, although some (such as the very first Iron Man) were very damn good.

I vowed that I would pay to watch ALL sequels to The Avengers in a proper cinema. I also forecast that the series of Avengers movies would be the best/greatest/awesomest trilogy (or quadrilogy) of all time.

So imagine my disappointment when, three years later (i.e. today), I had to sit through 2+ hours of an utterly pedestrian superhero movie. I felt like crying when, after random things blew up and rocks flew around and they went to ""The New Avengers Facility"", I realized the movie was coming to an end.

Because you deeply value my opinion, here are my rankings for the 11 MCU movies released so far (as of May/June 2015):

#1 Avengers 1 A++ One of the best movies ever #2 Iron Man A+ #3 Captain America 2 A #4 Guardians of the Galaxy A #5 Iron Man 2 A (unlike most, I actually liked this) #6 Thor 2 A-

#7-#10 B+ (Run-of-the-mill, predictable superhero movies) The Incredible Hulk Thor 1 Captain America 1 Avengers 2

#11 Iron Man 3 B- Total Scheiβe (compared to most of the other MCU movies). I hated this particularly bad.",7
A beast of a movie,12 July 2021,This movie was my favourite although people prefer infinity war or the first one i liked this more because they were in their prime they were all a big great team even though that was in the first one the first like 45 mins were boring and infinity war was a great movie but I just didn't like it.,9
A mostly fun mess.,5 September 2015,"Formulaic or not, it's undeniable what cultural impact The Avengers has had on the youngest generation of movie goers. Kids who were born in the Summer of '12 now claim the Avengers to be their favourite thing (source: my girlfriend's 3 year old nephew and his Hulk impersonations). I almost envy them for having such a planned web of movies to be nostalgic about in their teens. The closest thing I have is the long but more contained Harry Potter franchise, though I do pity their parents wallets when it comes to the eventual bulky boxsets. As the Marvel Cinematic Universe gets more and more crowded, so do their movies. Avengers: Age of Ultron has little room to breathe and is more-or-less a big stitched-together mess. A fun mess for the most part, but one that emits a consistent buzz of CGI, action sequences and fan service to the point where it's far too easy to become numb to the stakes as it goes along.

I really enjoyed the first Avengers, by about a million times more than any other Marvel movie, but I think the novelty of the group hit its limit there. The most efficient part of Age of Ultron is Robert Downey Jr's sharp witted one-liners, the best his humour's been yet, and one that will almost definitely go over the heads of the film's young fans. I knew the Iron Man series hinged on his charisma, but this film is hanging firmly by that rope now. I don't know what they're going to do when he signs off. Meanwhile, Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver are very poor additions to the clan and while I get the ideas behind Ultron, I could never get behind him to take him or his tried-and-tested plan seriously. If Whedon struggles to get enthused about this one, I don't see how I can be either. Easily beats Winter Soldier though. It's like a broken stained glass art with some shards I liked, some shards missing and some shards unpolished.

Synthetic fast moving film for hyperactive console kids,3 September 2015,"Unwatchable. Looks like a no-content pop video, but it lasts for 130 minutes... No atmosphere. No music. No character development. i would REALLY prefer to watch the care-bears from 1990 for excitement.

i counted 27 different cameras edited into in 7 seconds in a small section in the middle where i decided to count the focal time spent on scenes.

The average scene in this movie is probably about 0.6 second long, with a small few scenes lasting more than 5 seconds, and about 100000 scenes that last 0.1 seconds long.

It was abominable from a human standpoint. how much information do people exchange when they are interacting for 1 second at a time and then cutting to console-game animations.

The special effects were not amazing at all. I have only contempt for this cinematic style. Clearly you have to have been playing sonic the hedgehog and watching super-fast cartoons since the age of 2 years old, ALL DAY, to have a concentration that disrupted so that you can make sense of this movie.

I am sorry that i trusted IMDb reviews on this. I could write a these on how bad it is and how similar no scenery, no acting, no scenes, no music, frenzy, frenetic, zoom-around, no focal time, shaking, zooming, nauseating camera work with bad special effects, are wasting good Hollywood budgets and resources.

I would say that i twitched, recoiled, was perplexed.",2
Avengers: Age Of Ultron.,23 November 2015,"I read a couple of negative reviews of this film. It's not bad, it's not bad at all. I'm not even a fan of comic books and comic book heroes but these ""Avenger"" films, I think, are good. Although this film is a little flawed in it's over the toppness it's still a good film. There's plenty of action without a lot of in between dry dialog. We can think Tony Sparks (Robert Downey Jr.) and Ultron (James Spader) for that. Their witty remarks and jokes did add some good humor to this film. If you liked ""The Avengers"" you'll like this one as well. You won't be disappointed. Hopefully they're planning on making a third installment of this film. With the same director and writers going in the same direction as this one it will be a good one as well.",7

Acton packed Marvel sequel: uneven but punchy,3 May 2015,"Another shot for what has become the most successful franchise series of all time. The dollars are rolling in for the Marvel universe, and so time to milk another in this series.

The first Avengers was great, but this one does not have the comfort of the first which was introducing characters to write the story. Instead this adds more characters and it doesn't half become bloated. The story isn't a million miles from the standard super hero comic book, so no need to elaborate on that.

Anyhow, the action from the get go is full on and only a few lulls to fill in emotional storyline to make us empathise with our heroes.

Special effects are great and so forth,and acting is great as the actors have more than filled in the shoes of their characters.

The problem is that this is not bringing anything new to the table. If anything it's standard stuff, and so despite the heavy and long fight scenes, I was losing attention and interest. Seen it all before and done better elsewhere, and the villain was little interesting and should been fleshed out more.

With so many characters and cameos to fit in, it gets baggy and can't focus or develop. The Black Widow and Hulk relationship really wasn't working either when the only time in minutes that could be devoted to it could be counted in single digits.

Maybe this was missing someone of the quality of Loki/Tom Hiddlestone, who really stole the show in the Thor films and first Avengers film.

It's a fine Saturday night cinema blockbuster but after some great graphic novel adaptions of late, this is a disappointment for me. Not bad but not one I'll likely return to.",6
Underrated banger,22 January 2022,"This movie isn't nearly as bad as people make it out to be. The action is really nice and the villain is something different. Some of the scenes and characters are already iconic and legen.. wait for it.. dary. Ultron feels really human, even though he clearly isn't. I really liked the addition of Wanda and Pietro in this. They were really understandable and interesting. Vision was also added in this. This movie is stuffed with all kinds of stuff, but I feel like all of it was good.",8
"Good action movie for new audiences, not for the Marvel Fanboy..",7 May 2015,"I was very conflicted with my opinion of this movie. The plot was well done, the existing stellar Avengers cast with addition top James Spader providing the perfect voice for Ultron performed nicely as to be expected, the CGI was phenomenal, the movie was packed with good action/ fight scenes, and I didn't find myself losing interest once during a film exceeding 2 hours.

The above states my reason for the 7/10 rating, the below are is my critique to Joss and Marvel in defence to all the Fanboys whom have been saying ""Make mine Marvel"" for generations.

As a fan of the Marvel comic book, witch may only be a portion of the audience of these Big screen films, but witch is the core fan base who's support has kept Marvel in Business since for over 50 years which there would be no Avengers or Marvel franchises period without it really bugs me when writers and directors feel the need to change major parts of the Marvel universes such as character origins. If film creators want full creative control they should stick to original content films. I really wish Marvel would keep stricter control and consistency on this stuff. A few examples, Ultron was created by Ant-man not Iron Man. Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver have powers because they are the Mutant children of Magneto not because of some experimentation with a mystical gem by some Hydra mad scientist.. Which is inconsistent with the real Quicksilver we were recently introduced to in X-Men: DOFP. Quicksilver a loved character of Avengers and X-Men title fans for generations was killed off in his debut appearance on the Avengers team...

Also, with so many characters there wasn't time for character development outside of Hawk-eye and slightly with Black Widow. They started a love interest between Bruce Banner and Black Widow but didn't have enough time to properly do anything with. We got introduced to 3 well casts interesting characters in the twins and I'll get to Vision but didn't see enough from them or any development other then going from the villain to hero side with the flip of a switch, and if they had to make the mistake of killing Quicksilver why didn't we see more of his sister coping with it in the final aftermath scenes. We just didn't get to know a thing about vision outside him being a cyborg that flies and can hold Thor's Hammer. Why even pop in falcon for a 1 second appearance at the end.. Also I don't mind some humour and 1 liners in the heat of battle which is the Marvel way but this movie was overloaded with it especially coming from the supposedly cold evil robot main villain, Ultron should of been darker.",7
Fantastic Superhero Movie and a Great Follow-up!,16 January 2023,"As someone who has been a fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe since its inception, I was eagerly awaiting the release of Avengers: Age of Ultron. I can confidently say that it exceeded all of my expectations. From the opening action sequence to the thrilling finale, I was on the edge of my seat the entire time.

One of the things that stood out to me the most was the strong performances from the entire cast. Robert Downey Jr. Once again perfectly embodies the quick-witted & charismatic Tony Stark, while Chris Evans brings the right mix of leadership & vulnerability to Captain America. Mark Ruffalo, who I was particularly excited to see as the Hulk, was a standout, giving the character a depth & emotional range that I never thought possible.

Ultron, the film's antagonist, was also a standout. The portrayal of the AI by James Spader was both terrifying & intriguing. And, without spoilers, the climactic fight between the Avengers and Ultron was one of the most spectacular & epic action moments I hve ever seen in a superhero movie. I also have to commend the film's writers, who did a wonderful work of tying all of the many plots and characters together in a way that felt coherent & gratifying. The film's themes of sacrifice and family were particularly poignant and added a level of emotinal weight to the action.

To conclude, Avengers: Age of Ultron is a brilliant addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe that should not be missed. This is one of my favorite superhero movies I have seen so far.",8
A fairly decent sequel.,2 May 2015,"For any comic book/super hero movie lover it's somewhat like another DARK KNIGHT RISES(!)...there were rush & too many things going around but you're still going to love it as it packed with your favorite characters, plenty of awesome, eye catching action sequences and good dose of humor. Considering superbly well balanced storyline & characters of its predecessor ""THE AVENGERS (2012)"" which is one of the best superhero films ever made, AGE OF ULTRON is a fairly decent sequel, IMO. I think the super siblings, Ultron and even to some extent the ""surprise"" addition to the team 'The Vision' needed some more time to develop finely or may be it'd be better if they gradually introduced & developed this characters through some earlier other Marvel films like Loki for The Avengers (2012)...the audience already more or less knew about him through THOR (2011) and easily get cope with his motivations & schemes. And not only Loki, there weren't actually any new or fresh characters in 2012 Avengers Assembles who needed some time & space in character development area but this time there were one too many of them. Moreover, the plot was way simpler & more entertaining in first outing of the Avengers. Anyway, overall it won't be fair to say I'm disappointed with AOU but yeah...definitely could have been better.",7
Disney attempts a 'Power Rangers' ripoff...,7 May 2015,"thought I would give Avengers: Age of Ultron a try, the cast didn't seem too bad so how bad can it be? This movie just has no saving grace. A terrible plot filled with a cast who seemed to be trying to act their way out of a wet paper bag. It tries its hardest to make the audience laugh with the same repeated jokes and punch lines that just aren't funny.

Bad ad-libs aside, the aesthetic of the movie is just annoying. It looks like something out of a Pixar nightmare gone wrong.

In short its a movie filled with a decent cast who just didn't seem like they knew what to do with that they were being given. VERY bad facial hair on both males and females, and even worse quips.

Save yourself the trouble and just skip over this ""movie"".",1

I hope it will be decent, because you know how it is with those ratings nowadays Fear not~! Dr tgchan is here to examine this baby thoroughly~!

2 minutes – starts with high explosive action, right off the bat and unfortunately looks like a cartoon

19 minutes – it's surprisingly interesting, nice and pleasant to watch

42 minutes – the dialogues are very well written, acting is good and the film doesn't bore you at all

57 minutes – it's funny when needed, the action is great and CGI effects are really good. I am pleasantly surprised

1h 22minutes – I don't know what they have changed later on (after the opening scene), but it definitely doesn't look like a cartoon; top notch special effects

1h 48minutes – camera angles are amazing, one-liners makes you smile, action looks very very good to say the least, and you really have no reason not to like the film. Saving the world again. This would be my only complain, bu hey it is a super hero movie, so what did you expect?

It was really a decent film, I knew what to expect and I wasn't disappointed with it. Make sure you watch a short scene after the end credits.

Cool movie,19 January 2022,"A very interesting and exciting movie! I love fiction, it turned out to be a very interesting plot. I advise everyone to look. All the characters played their roles very well, it is clear that every hero knows his job, as well as the director. Marvel go ahead! I'm your fan!",10
Familiar...But Still Fun (For Now),10 May 2015,"There are a number of negative stances that one could take against The Avengers: Age of Ultron. You could argue that the film is repetitive and derivative, given that the Marvel factory has been reliably pumping out both tonally and visually similar films for the last half-decade. Any uniqueness that director Joss Whedon brought to the first Avengers installment feels comfortingly familiar rather than fresh and exciting. In particular, the action sequences have a been there, done that vibe to them. Rather than fighting endless waves of anonymous aliens, the Avengers now battle against endless waves of anonymous robots. Eventually there becomes a point of diminishing returns on seeing the heroes smash apart their opponents over and over again.

You could argue that the film feels overstuffed, even more so than its predecessor. In addition to servicing the six returning Avengers, the film also introduces the Maximoff twins (Quickslilver and Scarlet Witch, although never referred to by those aliases), as well as the villainous Ultron. That makes nine characters that have at least a minimal story arc, which could easily the film a bit too thin. In addition, time is also given to the numerous cameos from within the ever-expanding Marvel universe. The more characters and plot points that are touched upon, the more difficult it becomes to muster the energy to care.

Or you could argue that Age of Ultron isn't even really a film at all. Instead, it's merely a $300 million advertisement for future Marvel cinematic efforts. Anyone who pays attention to the endless superhero movie news cycle knows that the entire franchise is building towards the two-part Avengers 3. You could be forgiven in the lead-up to Age of Ultron for considering the film to be somewhat of an afterthought, and simply a prelude to the screen shattering Infinity War storyline that those two films will explore. Even within Age of Ultron it is made clear, through a muddled Thor storyline, that the real threat for the Avengers is yet to come. Understandably, Marvel likes having a five-year plan to ensure that riches continue to flow in. But the focus on the future has been to the detriment of the here and now.

All of the criticisms that are outlined above are hard to ignore. However, Age of Ultron manages to somewhat overcome them, and provide an enjoyable cinematic experience. Despite bringing nothing new to the table, the film still provides the fun that people loved about the first Avengers film. The climactic battle sequence does wear out its welcome eventually, but it is still exciting to see the heroes doing what they do best. The film's many characters are as much an advantage as a disadvantage. By this point everyone knows which Avengers they care about and which they don't. You're bored by the Hulk and Black Widow's blossoming romance? Well, don't worry the film only has time to develop the relationship over a few scenes. You don't care about Hawkeye's back-story and motivation? Well just wait a couple of minutes and we'll get back to the witty banter between Iron Man and Captain America. By having developed most of these characters previously, Age of Ultron can get away with divvying up the screen time almost equally, and not focusing on any character in particular.

The real strength of Age of Ultron, besides its world-class visual effects, is its characters. The reason this film works at all is because almost every actor performs with enough charisma to take over the screen, even when saddled with underwhelming material. Scarlett Johansson has never been particularly challenged by the part of Black Widow, but she makes the character more than simply the token female hero. Chris Evans takes a blander than bland character in Captain America and somehow makes him interesting. Robert Downey Jr. seems to inhabit the Iron Man character too well, to the point where it feels as if he's performing in his sleep. Even with limited screen time Aaron Taylor Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen are able to convincingly bring Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch to life. There are no weak links among the core cast, which helps to cover up many of the film's issues.

For people who love, like, or merely tolerate the Avengers saga, Age of Ultron provides more of the same. Fun character moments are interspersed with exciting action sequences. The trademark Whedon banter is present in full force, and makes many scenes zip along at a quick pace. But the Marvel formula is being stretched to its breaking point, and that is more apparent than ever in this newest film. With Age of Ultron familiarity still brings enjoyment, but unless a shake up is made soon that same familiarity will soon lead to disinterest.",7
"Plot meh, Avengers yay!",3 December 2021,"The plot along with the motivation of this movie's enemy were nothing new. Fearing danger, some guy starts building new weapons, this time our own Tony Stark (partly influenced by psychic powers). Out comes artificial intelligence who is confused by humanity.

He is confronted with the usual AI paradox. If his job is to protect humanity, and humanity does so much damage to itself via the never-ending wars, climate catastrophes, corruption, etc., the only correct move should be to eliminate humanity, right?

That's our foe's motivation to bring upon humanity's extinction.

Our avengers are confused and confronted by the biggest fears due to psychic manipulations of an enhanced woman. As in the first Avengers movie, their disparate views bring them into a fight with each other which ultimately of course resolves itself.

More action with the infinity stones is revealed and displayed. We've seen one infinity stone in action which is now attached to a guy who seems like an ally. He's a cool guy and can even lift Thor's hammer. He's strong but I've expected stronger with the infinity stones being the mightiest energy on the universe.

The plot was confusing, though. Nowhere was it explained why Tony Stark has his suits again. Didn't he dispose of them in Iron Man 3? What's up with Banner? Doesn't he have a sort of girlfriend at home? Why his affections with Natasha? Wasn't there something going on between Natasha and Captain America in the last Captain America movie? What's up with the enhanced twins? Their backstory wasn't touched upon a lot.

A lot of weird plot-adjustments. But it is still an Avengers movie, we still see the reunion of our favourite superheroes and they still rock.",8

"Are you a fan of well characters? If so, then DON'T SEE THIS",1 May 2015,"*Spoiler Free*

I just watched Age of Ulrton and I'm still in shock. It was complete trash! I have never been so tempted to start yelling in the movie theatre. Even the guy next to me was sighing in exasperation at the trash packed 2 hours and 21 minutes we suffered through.

It was the equivalent of a very OOC (Out of Character), poorly written and unedited fanfic that I wasn't able to backspace out of.

I am so profoundly disappointed and filled with rage.

I think what makes it even worse is that I recently watched Netflix's Daredevil, which had such rich characters, and then I watched Age of Ulrton and there was no mistaking or excusing the poorly written characters. The movie was bad, but against the memory of Daredevil it was even more of a let down. We had 13 hours of a brilliant story and characters with Daredevil and Age of Ultron couldn't even manage 2 hours and 21 minutes without completing screwing it up. There are brilliant Marvel works out there, but Age of Ultron is not one of them, not even close.

Lesson learned, I will not be watching any other movies that Joss Whedon writes alone. The first Avengers was fantastic, but that was also written with Zak Penn, not just Joss Whedon, so that explains it all I suppose. I grew up watching Buffy (and I still adore Firefly) so of course I wanted to love this movie, but the writing was horrible and I couldn't even slightly like this.

Age of Ulron is the ""Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift"" of the Avengers verse. Let's just pretend this movie didn't happen. We can move past this. The next 2 Avengers movies and ""Captain America: Civil War"" will be written by the some wonderful people that wrote ""Captain American: The Winter Soldier"". Skip this one. Please do not waste your time or money, you will be disappointed.",1

A popcorn movie which makes you care.,12 November 2021,"You already know what this is, it's a well made and fun action adventure super hero movie.

Likeable characters who we have gotten to know over the course of multiple movies and incredible special effects. As usual with the MCU movies there's a staggering amount of detail in everything, you could watch this movie 5 times and still notice things you've never seen before. The cast is excellent with Downey Jr, Chris Evans and Mark Ruffalo being highlights, there's a lot of characters in this movie but none of them feel like they were there for the sake of it. Every team member has something important to do.

The action scenes are huge and chaotic but it's always clear what is happening and it looks great. Compare this to a similar big budget summer action movie like Michael Bay's Transformers which throws so much stuff on screen it gets confusing as to what the hell is even supposed to be happening.

There's some nice character building as well, the scenes where the team hide out at Hawkeye's house with his family were especially well done. It makes you think how Hawkeye (being a normal person) must feel fighting along side people like Thor and Captain America who are pretty much godlike.

Going back and re-watching the older MCU movies, it's cool to see things which might seem inconsequential at the time pay off in the sequels. The team behind these movies really planned things out excellently.",8
Not amazing action and poor script fortunately aren't enough to turn this into a bad movie,14 November 2015,"The action scenes may be cool, but they can feel like senseless eye candy that makes little to no sense. It does not help that the story is inconsistent. It's about 40-60% action throughout the course of the film, but it's not great. Just when you expect action to happen, some of the silliest things happen. Even Fast and Furious movies have less senseless action.

The script is bad. Most jokes fall completely flat and even feel bad that they shouldn't be on there. Seriously, I almost wished the characters were silent, especially during the action scenes.

The only reason I found this movie worth watching is that the whole movie was at least bearable with some enjoyable moments. Nevertheless, the best action scene was in the beginning.

And since I really like the Diary of a Wimpy Kid books, I'm glad there was a scene with the kids reading those books. But was it necessary for me to watch 2 hours just to see the product placement for only a few seconds? I'm going to overlook the DoaWK reference in the scoring as if it doesn't matter by any means.

"Enjoyable Spectacle But Messy, Step Down",7 May 2015,,6
Brilliant action but I preferred the first Avengers movie. 7/10,21 September 2015,"Review: I'm really in two minds about this films because I liked epic action scenes and banter between the characters but none of them have really moved on from the first movie. I did prefer the action in the first Avengers and the introduction of the Hulk was brilliant but he was hardly in this movie. Anyway, the movies is about the Avengers taking on the evil Ultron who says that he wants to save the world but he really wants to destroy it. I think that's about it really! There's loads of technical jargon throughout the movie, which really went over my head but there are some other great elements like the introduction of 3 new characters, Quicksilver, Scarlet Witch and Vision. The attention to detail was spot on and I was on the edge of my seat throughout the whole movie but I still preferred the first film, mainly because of the shock factor. The fight between the Hulk and Ironman was one of the greatest scenes in the film and I enjoyed the scene when everyone was trying to pick up Thors mallet but I think my expectations were a bit too high. Anyway, it's definitely one to watch but I won't rate it as highly as the first movie! Enjoyable!

Round-Up: This franchise has definitely become the biggest of all time by taking the 4th and 6th place in the worldwide gross chart. Robert Downey Jr. also became the highest paid actor in 2014 with a massive $75million with Dwayne Johnson coming second with $52million. At 50 years old, Robert Downey Jr. has really turned his life around after being addicted to drugs and getting a lot of negative press. His career started in 1970 in a small movie called Pound and he hasn't turned back since. He was nominated for an Oscar in 1993 for his fantastic role as Chaplin but he lost out to Al Pacino in Scent of a Woman. He also was nominated for an Oscar for the best Supporting role in the extremely funny Tropic Thunder in 2009 which he also lost to the late Heath Ledger for his interpretation as the Joker in the Dark Knight.  I've always loved his acting and his unique screen charisma and he was still able to pull out great performances while he was under the influence. With another Sherlock Holmes movie in the pipeline along with Captain America: Civil War and Pinocchio, I'm glad to see that he has turned his life around to become one of the biggest stars in the world. With that aside, this movie was directed by Joss Whedon who wrote the original Toy Story, Alien Resurrection, Titan A.E., Atlantis, Serenity and both Avengers movies. He also directed the Avengers movies along with Serenity and he has definitely changed cinema with his fantastic action scenes and detailed story lines. 

Budget: $250million Worldwide Gross: $1.4billion

A Major Disappointment,8 May 2019,,3
just a little off...,5 May 2015,"That's really the easiest and best way to put it. This is certainly not the worst MCU film, but it is far from the best and not the avengers sequel most were hoping for. First off, so much care and attention has gone into releasing this films in an intricate timeline, yet plays as just a sequel to avengers caring very little for the various stand alone films and the TV show. Between avengers 1 & 2, iron man, thor, & cap USA have had there own movies and 40+ episodes of AOS, yet very little is mentioned about these things. We don't see how chummy Cap and widow have become, or a mention of starks PTSD. Better example: for 10 + episodes AOS have been building up InHumans and Baron Strucker ""testing"" certain people (the twins) yet you don't use this incredible already developed back story to further both this film, AOS, or the future InHuman movie. Despite the fact that you've already tied this movie into the last 2 eps of AOS s2.

It comes as no surprise to now hear of Whedon's displeasure with studio notes and interference. Whether you live or hate the movie, it is clear that this just doesn't feel like Whedon, it feels like someone telling Whedon to make a Whedon film. 2 of Whedon's trademarks are his dialogue and jokes, both of which are clunky in this film. Jokes you can tell Whedon wouldn't think are funny are somehow in the movie. The most obvious examples are the Thor pool scene and Hawkeyes home, which should have been omitted and extended respectfully. Behind the scenes a combination of (whedon) being burnt out and studio notes have obviously made this film suffer unnecessarily.

But the biggest problem of all is Ultron himself. Always Whedon's Achilles heel has been his inability to build formidable and believable villains, but Ultron is possibly his worst attempt, which is a shame considering how dangerous and formidable he was in the books and should've been on film. No time is devoted to developing him at all, it's literally, he's born and then there's hundreds of him, seemingly out of nowhere, with maybe 30 seconds devoted to building his army. For God's sake he's the smartest most sophisticated A I ever conceived (save for Jarvis) and his evil plan involves a meteor and not something nuclear connected to a mainframe? That's nonsensical. In avengers 1 we get an alien army complete with giant metal worms led by Loki that took all 6 avengers to stop. Here we get an army of ultron, from nowhere, when let's be honest, vision and scarlet witch could have easily defeated all the ultron robots by themselves. In addition not enough time is spent on the twins either, made even worse by their AOS tie in that should've been.

All that said, I still found this movie entertaining and rewatchable (I've watched twice before writing this), but as a popcorn flick, which sucks sense the MCU, for the most part is more than just good popcorn flicks. But to be fair it would be hard for any film to live up to not only the hype, but the incredibly high bar set by previous MCU installments. To the studio... wise up, you've already interconnected these installments very intricately use it. To Whedon... go home, rest and count your $$, you've earned it but it has clearly taken its toll.

"disappointing, though enjoyable, mess",3 May 2015,"Meh. That is my initial reaction from just seeing this film. Wasn't the worst movie I have seen, but definitely not one of the better ones. And this is from someone who LOVES superhero movies and Marvel comics. It is hard to explain just what is wrong with this film, but it just seemed ""off"". The acting didn't see sincere, as if everybody was just phoning it in. The jokes seemed flat. The action scenes were confusing, exhausting and ultimately boring. The villain was weak. Too many subplots. The romantic plot seemed to come from nowhere. In short, the very things that worked so well in the first film worked so poorly in this film. Also, they seemed to ignore Iron Man 3? There was no true end credit gag either. There was a semi-post credit scene (shortly after a few credits) but it was not surprising and even that felt like ""been there. done that.""

I have heard the Wheadon had to cut 30 minutes of the movie to keep it to its existing already long 2.5 hour version. Perhaps that extended cut on Blu-ray might yield a very different experience.

This version just left me tired and disappointed.

I would wait until this is on Blu-ray. No real reason to see it in a theater. There were no crowd-pleasing scenes.

The Vidiot Reviews....,16 September 2015,"Avengers: Age of Ultron

The best way to defeat a machine that has gone rogue is to tell it that its three-year warranty has expired.

Unfortunately, the android in this action movie is too smart to self-destruct.

Brought to life by Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) with data Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) downloaded from an infinity gem, Ultron (James Spader) vows to destroy humanity.

To do that Ultron requires a multitude of replicates, which could prove difficult as the other Avengers (Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner) have assembled with three new members (Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Elizabeth Olsen, Paul Bettany) to impede him.

More convoluted than its predecessor, this initial sequel stumbles out of the gate with questionable relationships, a so-so villain and a climax that echoes the original.

Fortunately, the aforementioned won't affect the overall enjoyment for less pedantic fans.

Besides, if the Avengers don't destroy them, the robots will take all our jobs.

Perfect,27 January 2022,These ranking always surprise me it was the best avenger movie. But the ranking for 2018 and 2019 ones are higher. I like this one because It happened on earth And it used less imaginary characters like talking rabbit .,9
The fine line between spectacle and spectacular,28 April 2015,"In my opinion, ""too much"" is never a problem if it is handled right. Everything can be on the line and happen at once, as long as it is presented by someone who can craft a story. With the Avengers-franchise, it has to be big, it has to be everything, but this also increases the difficulty of presentation. For, if done wrong, this movie could have easily become a transformers movie. The (cast and) crew deserves kudos for managing to make it bigger without losing their heads, and without losing the audience. The movie manages to present, update and focus on each of the many characters the Marvel Cinematic Universe as accumulated so far, in addition to managing to introduce new ones.

The major exception to this is maybe the Vision-characters. I am not familiar with this character in the comics, but I had a hard time understanding how powerful this character is, and just what he can do. At one point he seems like a Dr. Manhattan-esque guy, but at other points it's just another avenger-like hero. This will probably be more clear in the later movies, but that's not good enough.

Another problem this movie had was that ultron's army was as boring as any other stormtrooper-like characters from other movies like this. While the avengers did work together like a team, it seemed like many of them were at points reduced to fly-swatters. Maybe it's hard to avoid, but it's not really that fun to watch. The movie also had some good one-on-one fights (that were way more interesting).

Something I missed in this movie, but I guess will be more important onwards (with the next Captain America-movie in particular) is the relationship between the world society and the avengers. It was only briefly touched upon, but I guess a movie can't do everything.

As many others, I much preferred the first avengers-movie, because of a more interesting villain, and more memorable moments. This movie was also funny, though. Thor in particular. And the Hulk.

This is another one of those movies that you can't really miss if you are following the franchise, and you probably won't pursue if you haven't followed it. It's good, not great, and it doesn't disappoint, but at the same time it does not exceed my expectations.",7
"Good, but....",7 September 2015,,7
Are movies so formulaic now that audiences can't hope to expect anything more than this in a blockbuster?,30 April 2015,"To give credit where it's due, Whedon again does a great job making believable the interactions of a very disparate group of characters. Just the idea that a thawed-out WW2-Uber-patriot, a Norse god, and strangely likable arrogant-genius who wears a metallic-supersuit could occupy the same film universe seems ridiculous on paper (Let's hope Snyder can do as well with Amazons and Mermen in Justice League.) The actors do a good job inhabiting their characters, and Whedon succeeds in creating character arcs with the amount of time available. The long arc that takes the Scarlet Witch from an ally of Ultron to a foe feels natural. Secondary characters typically fail to connect with audiences, but her scene with Hawkeye and her brother's sacrifice makes her contribution to Ultron's downfall more than filler. The film also does not feel overstuffed with characters, though it's pushing the limit.

Whedon attempts to bring more depth to AoU, but AoU's attempt to walk that line undermines its ability to repeat the original's feel- good ending. At the same time, AoU doesn't successfully bring added gravitas to the franchise, like The Empire Strikes Back did after the original Star Wars. Some of the action is exciting, but the film doesn't feel as light and fresh, partly because it's too similar to its predecessor. Again, the Avengers fight a hoard of generic enemies, this time on multiple occasions, and so, it starts to feel like it's repeating the first film's battle of Manhattan again and again.

In the end, AoU is held back by a number of flaws--those deriving from its plot's formulaic nature, its villain's motives, and the level of the film's stakes. AoU lacks strong tension because it never feels that heroes' lives are threatened. Once again, the most exciting fight occurs between two Avenger team members. (At least this time, Whedon doesn't intercut this fight with scenes of other heroes fixing an engine.) However, when it comes to their main adversary, it's mostly the Avengers engaging a hoard of generic robots they outmatch. Some might argue a death or serious injury might undermine the fun. Well, in Star Wars, Luke's entire squad is wiped out, and that film is the embodiment of escapist fun. Furthermore, these are comic-book characters. Superheroes never really die. How about this--Tony is grievously wounded and needs cybernetics just to move, right at the very time he wants to leave his technology behind. An injury like that would raise the stakes plus lead to inner conflict later, right? Without any sense of threat, some of AoU's action scenes start to feel like video-games.

Ultron is an interesting villain, and as a character, he works. However, as a being of advanced-AI, he's also pretty stupid, and that brings us to the deeper problems with AoU--its plot. What does Ultron do just after being created? This brilliant tactician attacks the Avengers without ever assessing their weaknesses. After gaining consciousness, an intelligent Ultron would've remained out of notice as long as possible as he secretly built himself and his robot buddies into an indestructible army. Why didn't he do this? Probably because Disney cynically felt audiences have the attention span of gnats, and since there had been dialogue for 10 minutes, we needed another fight. What's next in Ultron's plan? He wants to steal some really strong metal. Is this really the best move? Uh, no, or lobsters would be the apex predator in the ocean, and armadillos on land, but of course, Ultron really doesn't go to Wakanda for this purpose. He does so to set up the soon-to-be-released Black Panther movie. Then there's Ultron's world destruction plan, which is preposterous and unrealistic. If Ultron could make a device that can turn a city into a gigantic meteor, then he could presumably upgrade himself without having to steal tech from all over the world.

Most significantly, Ultron's motives make little sense. He wants to rid the world of people to achieve peace, right? Well, peace means groups of individuals getting along without conflict. Exterminating life on earth won't bring peace because there won't be any individuals left. Later, he apparently concedes some people might survive--and they'll start anew--but why would these people be any more peace-loving? Food-shortages and a-total-economic-collapse don't typically bring out the best in people. Then what if Ultron's plan works too well, and it wipes out everything on the planet including himself and his robo-friends? Will we have achieved peace because the lifeless rocks that remain won't fight each other? Spader's delivery gives Ultron's nonsense dialogue some menace, but Ultron's plan and how he attempts to achieve it make no sense. Even without deep analysis, these problems with the plot are pretty apparent. It just feels off.

The deepest failings of AoU do not lie with its villain, however. In part, that's because Ultron isn't the film's villain. That honor instead belongs to Tony Stark. From Frankenstein to Jurassic-Park, the arrogant guy who unleashes a ""monster"" onto humanity is the REAL villain, and that individual pays for his hubris. Besides some momentarily disgruntled Avengers, the film does little to recognize Tony for what he is. In fact, after creating a threat that nearly destroys the planet, he later repeats the act with no knowledge that it will turn out any better. Some will say, ""Wait for Captain- America- 3."" No, we shouldn't wait because our heroes shouldn't. They're not idiots; they can see what's going on and should recognize that Tony should never be allowed near any device more complicated than a toaster. His actions are that much of a threat. Furthermore, an arrogant Tony struggling with the issue that he's the real problem and serious conflicts with the other Avengers about his decisions would be ways to bring the film some much needed dramatic heft.

Ultimately, AoU is a missed opportunity to further the franchise.",3
Trailer almost as misleading as Iron Man 3's (Spoilers),12 June 2015,"I wanted to score this film higher but although I do love spectacle, it just felt way too mindlessly Michael Bay-esque and the scale of explosions and destruction served no purpose.

I felt that almost every other problem I had with the film could have been addressed by simply splitting the thing up into two parts like they are planning to do with Infinity War. I mean, when I think about the missed marketing opportunity (Avengers 2 split into 2 parts, followed by Avengers 3 split into 3 parts-how brilliant would that have been?) it really just compounds the problem and makes Marvel seem all the more foolish for it.

Had this solution been utilized, there would have been so much more room for essential things like new characters' backstories, and development for old and new characters, especially main villain Ultron. The sinister ""There are no strings on me"" from the trailer that sent chills up my spine came to naught as Ultron became essentially a dark mirror of Tony Stark with way too little behind his motivation to do anything he did (like most of Iron Man's villains so far), let alone to despise and resent his creator the way he seems to. Also, more gradual evolutions in his plans to ultimately concoct and carry out what became his final scheme would have been better too.

The twins suffered the same problem of lack of exposure and development. Vision too, but I could forgive that if only because the character was intended to be something of an enigma, but for the former two to actually join forces with Ultron, I would have expected much more backstory, perhaps a flashback rather than simply being told what happened to make them vengeful against Stark and company.

Trying to cram everything, including the excessive one-liners, into a single film was, regrettably, a disaster. If what I hear about there being a 4-hour cut of the film, that would probably have fixed just about every problem I addressed. This was a serious problem with a simple solution that they had years to decide to release in two parts and just dropped the ball.

For what it's worth, it was entertaining enough, definitely set up a lot of future intrigue, and the interactions of the team together, now that their familiarity has increased, were very pleasing and the increased team dynamic as far as combat is concerned was more than a little satisfying but the ride was just too fast to enjoy everything properly and be given everything on our wish list. With the ever-expanding nature of the MCU, dropping us into what felt more like an 'in media res' scenario that never bothered to go back and explain how point A led to point B was a foolhardy decision, creating an even greater sense of overly accelerated pacing and unanswered questions.

Don't expect this one to deliver what the first one did. A bloated, runaway mess may not have been what they were going for but they ought to have known that this recipe would have inevitably ended up as one.",6
Is Bigger Better?,13 July 2021,"The second Avengers had the weight of expectation on it. It was following the really enjoyable first film, coming on the back of Captain America: The Winter Soldier and Guardians of the Galaxy, and had to set up the future films. It had a lot of balls to juggle and it did stumble at times.

Age of Ultron was an incredibly busy film and for better and for worst it was the Marvel version of a Transformers. It was filled with characters and storylines. There was a lot of action that will please fans of the superhero genre, like the fight between Iron Man and the Hulk, and the opening and closing battles. But there were issues because so much going on that some characters were pushed to the side. James Spader was a disappointment as Ultron because his character just kept making jokes throughout the film. It took anyway any menace he had.",8
"Another year, another Marvel film, another Avengers movie.",3 October 2015,"This was... entertaining at least, but Age of Ultron features some of the Hollywood toxins that plague several big budget productions today, from pointless comedic quips that add nothing to the story or characters, overuse of CGI that isn't the prettiest thing to look at, and a story so overloaded that it feels empty compared to what came before.

Age of Ultron wasn't Guardians of the Galaxy, certainly wasn't Marvel's Daredevil (the Netflix TV show), and didn't have nearly the same level of excitement as Captain America: The Winter Soldier let-alone the clear James-Bond- esque direction that movie went for. Ultron is its own thing even if that 'own thing' is from self-derived clichés of the genre Marvel has helped make as industry staples.

I do love the superhero genre in film, but Age of Ultron has all the clichés we've come to expect from it and doesn't take nearly as many risks as the first Iron Man film did. There was just no danger, nothing that stood out from what we've already seen in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

Entertaining, but not substantial as a standalone film for the uninitiated. I'd recommend going onto Netflix and watching Marvel's Daredevil.",7
"It's no game changer, but it's worth your attention.",27 May 2015,"I can't love Age of Ultron like I loved the first film. Some of the appeal of seeing our heroes together for the first time has left. The jump cut action is a bit unsatisfactory this time around. The narrative has lost its streamlined perfection and yet feels incomplete. This film is filled with misfires in characterization, tone, action, and storytelling. And yet while a flawed film, it is worth a ticket price. Age of Ultron still has plenty to offer. It gives us several new characters like Ultron and Scarlet Witch that add new life to the cinematic universe, and Josh Whedon continues to avoid overwhelming the audience with his massive assemble. In the end, this is a fun, big action film with plenty of likable characters and moments. However, it also suffers heavily from unevenness of the execution. As such the sequel failed to outdo the much slicker original film.",8
"Good action, but thats it",28 April 2015,"I had mediocre expectations of the movie and I was more looking forward to see the hulk buster armour than anything. The CGI and action were satisfying and of course all over the place.This movie is definitely not worth the 3D but is worth watching in the cinemas.

There is some back story for Black Widow, but she still ends up being more of eye candy and her character doesn't add any substance whatsoever.

My partner who loved the previous movie slept halfway through this one, though she was there only to see Chris Helmsworth, but he couldn't even save the movie!!",6

Good But Not Quite As Good As the Original,1 May 2016,"Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015)

*** (out of 4)

Tony (Robert Downey, Jr.) and Bruce (Mark Ruffalo) are nearing completion of Ultron in hopes of bringing world peace but something goes wrong and soon what seems like an unstoppable force has the Avengers on the brink of ending.

AVENGERS: AGE OF ULTRON wasn't nearly as good as the first film in the series but there's still plenty to enjoy here as director Joss Whedon manages to keep the action scenes full of energy and there are enough bits of comedy to make the film enjoyable to watch. With that said, I'd be lying if I said the story itself was anything overly special and at times the extended running time seems to be going on for too long.

There's still enough great action here to make the film worth sitting through. This includes the non-stop action scenes all of which seem to get bigger and better than the previous one. The ending is something I won't spoil but it contains quite a bit of imagination and it really comes to life. As I've said before, it's really amazing how far CGI has come over the past decade. Whereas at one time you could always tell what's fake that's not the case any more. The CGI flawlessly blends in with the live action to where it blends perfectly together.

Another major plus for the film is that the casting is simply perfect. By this point in the series you know that Downey is just flawless as Tony Stark/Iron Man but the rounding cast is also terrific. Chris Hemsworth, Ruffalo, Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Samuel L. Jackson, Don Cheadle and Elizabeth Olsen are all very good and certainly help bring these characters to life.",
Fun but inferior to Avengers Assemble,6 July 2020,"In what is becoming a typical Marvel movie we have plenty of drama, humour and bombastic action, but as entertaining as it is it is not as good as the first film. It's like a hyperactive child who ate too many sweets...excitable and unfocused. Still, Ultron was quite cool...",7
The worst Avengers movie,15 October 2019,,8
"Incredible action, and more depth.",8 June 2019,"I didn't like 'The Avengers' but nevertheless decided to give 'Age of Ultron' the benefit of the doubt and watch it. I'm glad I did.

I must be honest, after the opening - which made the film look more like a video game than a live action movie - I had little hope of enjoying it. Thankfully the film vastly improved after the opening scene. Some of the visuals were overdone, but for most part the visuals were spectacular. The slow motion photography with stuff happening all over the screen was incredible. Hollywood's inclination to destroy as much as possible in these movies never cease, do they, but I admit it really was actually fun in this movie.

This was the most I've enjoyed the Tony Stark character since 2008's 'Iron Man'. In fact, I enjoyed ALL the characters so much more than in 'The Avengers'. They had more flesh to them (uhm, figuratively speaking, off course). The plot and characters had more depth, and I enjoyed the chemistry between Black Widow and Hulk. It was subtle and sincere.

'Age of Ultron' was wonderful entertainment from beginning to end. The attack on the city during the finale was sensational!! This honestly was a lot of fun!",7
Terrible,17 May 2015,"Where to start? The story is undeveloped. It's full of attempts at developing the characters but turns into a whine-fest. The CGI is so over the top that the action is often hard to follow. The one-liners are so predictable that you can see the punchline coming long before its given. I regret paying to see this - first time I've felt that way since I was 12. There were a few moments of suspense, but even those had predictable outcomes. I enjoyed the Captain America films, and had hoped this would live up to those. However, it seemed like having numerous heroes spread the focus of the movie so far that it just becomes a muddled mess. In turn, too many heroes led to too many villains, with very character development beyond the antagonist and no explanation of other villains abilities or weaknesses.",1
Not wonderful,28 March 2020,"From the beginning of the movie, when a group of loser - controlled robots were fighting with the students, to the end of the film or a group of robots were playing, the only change was that loser was replaced by Auchuang. The same boring fight, the same slow motion and the end of the slow motion replay, so that the film did not even have a climax!",6
Entertainment And More,18 July 2021,"With Joss Whedon as writer and director, this penultimate film of the MCU's phase two starts with an advantage. He has written a complex story about the evil forces that fill the Hydra void. Strucker has been grooming the Maximoff twins, Wanda (Elizabeth Olsen) and Pietro (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) for unknown mayhem.

But the real peril of this episode comes from a benign source. Tony Stark, working with Bruce Banner, inadvertently unleashes a new entity, Ultron, meant to be a global watchdog.

The job of mopping up now becomes an attempt to put a genie back in the bottle for the Avengers. The story involves changes in loyalties and the creation of another new being. Some Avenger backstories are fleshed out. There are hints of romance.

Whedon gives us grand spectacles and battles conducted at such speeds that slo-mo is employed for appreciation by viewers. There is an Alamo-like showdown.

Like other MCU films, ""Age of Ultron"" engages in philosophizing. Steve Rogers says, ""Every time somebody tries to end a war before it starts, innocent people die. Every time."" That message is the heart of the film. Behind all the high tech visual wizardry lies that message as it pertains to A. I. It's a message that elevates the film to more than entertainment.",8
Oh boy!,17 May 2015,"I saw this Thursday night before May 1st in a jam packed IMAX theater with some of my friends and it was honestly one of the best movie theater going experiences I've ever had! That being said, the film itself has essentially the same overall plot as the first film but what we got was pretty cool. The action was very, very well done and the cinematography is up there with The Dark Knight films and Man of Steel (those having the best film work out of the superhero films, imo). The script was amazing and the dialogue was perfect, encompassing who these characters are at heart.

Where this film faults is its very thin narrative and pacing. The nearly two and a half hour film flies by without notice and there is literally never a boring moment BUT there are many subplots that aren't fully developed (which will more than likely be solved in the bluray extended release).

Overall, while extremely enjoyable, the film suffers from the same exact problems the first film had. You know exactly how it will end and the narrative really just isn't that interesting.

That opening tracking shot though...the ticket is worth the price just for that scene alone! 7.5/10",7
"Great critiques, one weak spot",7 April 2020,"The second movie of the Avengers presents action with a lot of social/political critique. New heroes are shown and some open spots are left. All of this to create a well-constructed cinematography based on the great acting, special effects, direction and screenplay writing. Different from the major of Marvel's movies, Avengers: Age of Ultron are constantly forcing the viewer to think about social/political questions centered on technology and union of people. This is a great advanced made by the production, because it compensates the all-action in the first Avengers and starts a new era for Marvel. You will realize a lot of open spots on the plot, they are not screenplay's failure, they are proposital leaks to new advances in the Marvel's universe that will be resumed in posterior movies. The only weak point on the work is the new hero. He is used as a key-point to the development and conclusion of the story, but he hasn't a great construction as character and break the rhythm of the plot, besides his adding to the reflections about society and humanity during the movie. Therefore, if he was substituted to explore more one of the heroes and the new piece of Marvel's universe, the movie will be 10/10.",9
A painful Avengers movie,17 March 2022,"The more you rewatch this movie, the worst it gets. The directional choices made by Joss Whedon are bad, and I'm happy that this was the last marvel movie he directed. We finally get some screen time from Hawkeye, and we learn more about him. He is probably the best character in the movie. The interactions of the superheroes is still good, but we don't get much good out of this movie. Age of Ultron isn't great, but it does set the storyline for the future of the MCU, and for that I can appreciate.",6

James Spader is menacing,1 August 2020,"SYNOPSIS: While trying to protect the Earth from outside threats, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) creates ""Ultron"" (James Spader) as ultimate knowledge and a body of armor around the Earth. What Stark didn't know, was that he was creating something with the intentions of destroying everything.

REVIEW: This film might be the most underrated film in the entire MCU. By this, I don't mean people think it's the worst film, but they don't rate it as high as I believe it deserves. It's not a perfect film (Russian accents were... let's not talk about it), but it adds so much to the MCU story. It gives you a huge look into the importance of Hawkeye and shows the audience what's at stake for him versus everyone else. That he really is the only one with something to lose and he doesn't have a super power. Then you get even, mire conflict between Tony Stark and Steve Rodgers (Chris Evans) conveying how different theirs opinions are on the current (current as in the timeframe of the MCU at the time I'd release) ""world ending"" situation. Although the Russian Accents were... not spectacular, you get a dive into the origin of Scarlett Witch and Quicksilver and why they feel hatred towards Stark, however, not to the world as a whole. The pathos is easy to sympathize with.

I'm so glad this was the conclusion to the Russian accent, I also wish they didn't expand on this weird love story between Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo). I think the Russo's did pick up on the strange relationship there and decided to defuse it relatively quickly. I do understand why those two character would have an attraction, I mean Scarlett Johansson... but on a serious note they do have similar situations and so it makes sense, but there was never any real build up to it. I feel there wouldn't have been enough time to delve deep into that.

Lastly, James Flippin' Spader is something else. His voice fits the character of Ultron so well. The inflections in his voice really bring a depth to the character. It gives you the feeling that this character is evil before they even do a terrible act. That's impressive. I do feel Ultron is a very underrated villain in the spectacle of MCU villains and should be treated with more respect.

This is a film I always enjoy coming back to and I feel people should give more of a chance and see it for what it is. Even if you're not a fan of Hawkeye and his relevance to the Avengers... 7.7/10.",7
Avengers Returns : An Excellent Sequel...,17 August 2021,"Perfect sequel of the first avengers movie. The mighty Avengers returned with new mission. This time the enemy didn't come from space. Tony and Bruce created them by mistaken and this time there will be more challenges for our heroes. Some new heroes will join the team also. And the action is superb. All actors are good, specially Robert Downey jr. I'm just waiting to watch them together again.",10
Slowly peters out,5 August 2020,"This film starts off with good build up and dramatic stakes but it slowly peters out due to a bland villain. The initial assault on the castle, the mysterious new superpowered people, the secret plot, the fight between Hulk and Iron Man, the creation of Vision - these are all great elements that propelled the plot along. However, Ultron himself is just too boring despite the charisma of his voice actor, and his robot army is expendable metal. This made the excitement just fade.",6
Another stupid comic book cash grab,1 May 2015,"I saw this movie and was appalled. By it's awfulness. It had an overly simple, idiotic plot. The character development was bad. James Spader was one of the most annoying villains of all time. His character is generic and follows the same patten as the last Avengers movie villain; acts like a normal person, but is really tough. My brain hates me for watching this movie, which I didn't want to go see, by the way. This is one of the stupidest movies I've seen this year. The visuals were clearly only there for a 3D movie. The dialog wasn't unique or great in any way. And the romantic chemistry between two characters came out of nowhere and was totally rushed. This movie is the definition of overrated. It's the film equivalent of a guy standing at the corner and asking everyone for their money even though he clearly is rich. Hollywood needs to quit making these superhero movies.",1

When this first came out, I simply enjoyed it a lot. It was funny, cool, and an absolute joy ride. It's definitely not the best avengers film like Endgame, or Infinity War, or even The first Avengers movie. It's just weak compared to all three.

The worst avengers movie but far from even a bad action film.,28 June 2020,,7
Extremely entertaining film,12 March 2022,"Tony Stark and Bruce Banner are in the process of building what is essentially a world wide security out fit to defend the world. But during this process a new threat is created in the form of Ultron.

This movie is very entertaining, it's great to see all of these classic characters in one film as well as all of the accompanying action scenes. The action in this film is handled extremely well and allows for every character to have their own stand out action moment.

The cast is all great as usual but we also have a couple of new additions. Elizabeth Olsen is great as Wanda Maximoff and I like her character a lot. Aaron Taylor Johnson as Pietro Maximoff was also great and actually really funny. The stand out for me though is James Spader voicing Ultron. Ultron is a really cool villain and surprisingly funny. He has this sarcastic personality to him and it's highly entertaining.

Now that being said I did have issues with all three of the new cast members. The Maximoff siblings have a few plot lines that never really get fulfilled and makes their characters introduction feel incomplete. Ultron was a very rushed villain and although the character himself was fun, they needed to have some extra origin scenes for him so we can feel more emotionally invested.

The other issue I have is there are a few moments in this film that are unneeded and if they were removed it might have helped with the development of the new characters.

All in all this movie is great. All of the characters are great and have good on screen chemistry. The action is highly and the film has quite a few comedic moments. That being said it did feel rushed at times and didn't allow the audience to become as invested as they could have been.

8/10.",8
Worth watching for MCU continuity,27 September 2021,"Tony Stark and Bruce Banner create an artificial intelligence program to defend Earth from an extra terrestrial threat.

For me this is the weakest Avengers outing and one of the least memorable MCU movies. However I think it is worth watching for continuity and the enjoyment of later movies in the franchise.

The story has some important elements to the larger MCU narrative, such as character origins, introductions, and setting up stories in later films. As an individual plot I don't think it's particularly compelling. The general pattern is long, talky, exposition dumps laden with technobabble, that are broken up by cartoon-like, CGI action sequences.

The concept of Ultron explores some great underlying themes about humanity and technology. It also works for the development of certain characters, but for me it is not a hugely credible movie antagonist. There is only so much I can watch superheroes smashing machines to pieces with relative ease and stay interested.

My favourite moments of action spectacle involve the Avengers saving people. I think superhero movies often focus so much on confrontation between heroes and villains they forget that it can be just as exciting to watch powers being used to save lives. There are some nice examples of this here.

I think the visuals are great from the perspective of the art design, but there is so much hyperkinetic fighting, jumping, chasing, flying, and cool moves crammed into the action sequences I find it distracting and feel a bit numb to it all

This review comes on my second watch of 'Age of Ultron' and it says a lot when the only scene I actually remember from the first time (considering there is so much effort put into its spectacle) is the party game involving Thor's hammer.

I enjoyed some of the character moments, particularly the ones that lay foundations for future conflict within the Avengers. Stark has plenty of development, likewise Clint Barton, and the 'work romance' between Banner and Natasha Romanoff plays out quite well. There are also good characters introduced like Wanda Maximoff, Vision, and Ulysses Klaue.

Unfortunately the dialogue for me is not as well written as other Avengers movies, but to be fair the actors do their best to make it as entertaining as possible. Scarlett Johansson, Mark Ruffalo, and (briefly) Paul Bettany are the standout performers for me.",6
Weaker moments- but thankfully not a weak film,28 June 2021,"It may not match the quality of the first film- but Avengers Age of Ultron packs enough dazzling action and entertaining superhero schlock for any fan to enjoy. I'll start with the flaws of the film, and really they tend to be quite repetitive. The beginning of this film is structured horribly. I get that they want the audience to find them in the middle of the action, but it's just so unbalanced to the rest of the film and forced just enough for it to be annoying. Joss Whedon's script itself isn't anything superb, a menacing villain yes, but his reason and logic go out the window about half way through the film completely- and it doesn't quite seem as realistic anymore. There are also just some lines of dialogue that seemed forced, and truly don't need to be there, although I appreciate Whedon trying to appeal to the audience (at least somewhat). That all being said, I enjoyed the h*** out of this film. It's incredibly entertaining to watch, and though we have had moments of disagreements between these characters before, it's so interesting to see their dark sides shed light on like this- and very largely that is due to Elizabeth Olsen's character Wanda Maximoff. Not only does she add a larger psychological element to the film, but she is also the only character we see truly grow over her time on screen, and I truly do love the way they entered her into the MCU- her being one of my favorite characters. The action scenes in the film are done incredibly well, and I enjoyed the cinematography very much. It may not be perfect, but it's a fun blockbuster with some excellent moments of depth- and maybe that's all it needs to be.

The Avengers Age of Who???,3 May 2015,"I'll be quick on this review. it's funny how people on here give this movie 8 out of 10 stars or say it's the best super hero movie they have seen.The Avengers movie came out in 2012. This movie came out in 2015.This is the Same Exact Formula and Sequences from the First Avenger movie!! A bad guy appears or comes to Earth,he wants to destroy Earth, The Avengers find out about him, the Avengers fight him and lose the first fight,they then regroup and fight not just the bad guy but a bunch of faceless henchmen and they win, Hooray!! And then while you are eating your popcorn near brain dead , The Hulk fights one of the Avengers- Not the bad guy---and tears up something .It really shows people will pay to see anything and there are no more writers or story creators in Hollywood.I can't believe Captain America the Winter Soldier was better than this .",3
Comparisons between 1 and 2,31 May 2015,"The Avengers films are always interesting, the first one being the epitome of the Superhero genre. It was and still is perfect, and interesting to compare the Marvel films entirely (not matter which studio) to the darker DC Universe of Batman (Nolan) and the Superman reboots. Probably only Superman 1 and 2 compare to the Marvel films for mind bending fun.

The various Marvel sub-genres, Thor, Ironman, Captain America, are all expertly produced and mounted entertainment, solid and well crafted.

But Ultron is, well, different. Watched it last night and after the 1st viewing in Imax 3D - essential - I was struck by the length of the film and the mindless fighting scenes. The lovely Safe House sequence dead center is a rest from the chaos surrounding the fights with Ultron and just about everybody else.

Film editing is an art, not a science, but I could have cut perhaps 20 minutes out easily by trimming down the endless battle sequences. After a while, SOMEBODY has to get hurt and the Avengers get hurt soooooo rarely. Natasha is human through and through - never a scratch. Tony Stark out of armor is just a human too. Never really hurt. And yet the chaos begs incredulity. Cutting it back would make it more believable.

And yes, it is still a boatload of fun.",7

Over-hated,11 May 2024,"Hadn't seen this since it was in cinemas. I know a lot of people seem to really hate it, and maybe some of those people took some time to turn on it, but I still like it quite a lot.

I like a lot of the contentious creative decisions it makes. I like its attempts to get a little darker and more psychological, and the way the main characters are at each other's throats just as much as - or maybe more than - they work together. Sequences like the party early on and then the hulkbuster scene are top-tier, and Ultron's a fun villain. And, in hindsight, I like the way this hints at a bunch of phase 3 movies.

I had a dream once where I was watching Age of Ultron alone in a living room, and people constantly kept coming into the room, walking behind me and laughing at the fact I was enjoying it. Maybe admitting I still like it in 2024 will make people laugh at me now, but whatever- I still like it in 2024 (that being said, I will agree with the general consensus that it's the weakest of the four Avengers movies so far, though).",8

Great action scenes and spectacular special effects with a strong cast of characters,12 October 2018,"Great action scenes and spectacular special effects with a strong cast of characters and actors who manage to show both the superhero and human sides to their characters. The plot is typically extravagant, but fits in nicely to the greater plot arc, and the comedic one liners are used well. Although different enough, it does become quite samey, especially when compared to the Avengers' previous outing.",8
Disappointed,4 May 2015,"I was neither lucky nor unlucky to watch this movie. I am not going to spoil anything for anyone, so I will just sum up the movie for you. Although, the movie had a lot of action, destruction and science-fiction in it but it seemed kind of dull to me.

I was so excited for this one but it did not live up to my expectations. There are way too many flaws in it. This is nothing compared to the original. The plot is quite uninspiring. I don't know much about comic story but on the screen the plot is weak.

There are one-liners after every two minutes of the movie, which I would rather criticize than praise because they had a world to save. Also, there is no character development and Ultron guy is the worst villain I have ever seen in any Marvel movie and is so boring.

I did not expect from Marvel to mess up with such a big movie especially the script. It may become the highest grossing movie of the year or second or third highest but the fans would be disappointed.

The only reason I am rating it six stars is that CGI effects were impressive plus Hawkeye, Quicksilver and his twin sister Scarlett Witch were great. I would recommend everyone to wait for the DVD rather than go to cinema and get disappointed on big screen, unless you don't care about money. Thank you! :)",6
Gets better with every viewing.,14 September 2021,"When this first came out, I was non-plussed. I thought it was okay.

Joss Whedon was in the middle of being 'cancelled' by the progressive mob, (many of whom were so adamant about their bandwagon distaste for the man that they retroactively denied ever having liked Buffy the Vampire Slayer or Firefly, despite probably having cosplayed as characters from those properties at some point. Progressives are not exactly the epitome of rationality.)

In any case, the film didn't deliver whatever magic the earlier MCU movies had delivered, and audiences felt it.

However, upon later re-watches, I have found that my appreciation for the film continues to rise. It might actually be one of my favorite entries into the Marvel suite at this point.

Perhaps this is due to the fact that all the major characters were later developed in subsequent films, so that going back to see them in Age of Ultron allows a more profound connection to the individuals in the large ensemble cast.

For instance.., the Vision was first introduced in Age of Ultron, but went on to play a pivotal role in Infinity War and feature in Wandavision, where the character was allowed much more range and the actor did a bang-up job in provoking emotional sympathies. Going back to see him in Age of Ultron was no longer a case of, ""Who is this purple guy and why do I care?"" but rather now a, ""Ohhhh. And see how Wanda reacts to him? Ooooh.""

And that's just one of the characters. The viewer has the same advantage of foreknowledge now with all the characters, so that watching Age of Ultron today becomes a very different and more layered experience than it did when it first hit theaters.

I'm upping my star score on this film from an 8 to a 9 as a result.

I can't think of any other film franchise where I've noticed this effect.

Very interesting!",9
Seems Remake of X Men: Future Past days,11 May 2015,"Every scene was similar to X-men future past days. I felt it like just an enhanced way of that movie.

Like every superhero movies, One super villain comes to the picture and then He start to destroy the whole world and super heroes try to save world. All things are just similar. Nothing is new. Everything is just repeated, Nothing else.

Suggest, if you don't have any other good movie to watch then you can go for it.

What to watch: Fight between Hulk And Iron-Man. What to not watch: This movie.",6
It too childish too my liking,22 April 2015,"Maybe it's just me, but this movie it just another super clichéd explosion fiesta movie like every Marvel movies. Like the Avengers, or Thor, or Captain America, this movies is just CGI effect after CGI effect without any story in it. You'll baffled at so many plot holes (if there is a plot in the first place) this movie has.

If you are a teenager with love of explosion, this movie is for you. But if you are looking for good story, characterization, plot, emotion in a movie, then pass it. It's not worth your time.

You won't miss anything.

Believe me.

A very fun film that doesn't deserve the hate,13 July 2015,"Now let it be said that I didn't find the first movie to be the most excellent thing ever but I quite enjoyed it none the less. This film has a better array of villains for sure, having an A.I gone rogue and two cool new super villains that I found a lot more entertaining than Loki and the whatever army. The characters don't have to be introduced this time and get time to develop and go through new challenges. THe movie explores Black Widow's traumatic past, Hulk's dangerousness, Hawkeyes family life and many others. The action is a bit shaky but I quite enjoyed it and the settings are very interesting. I won't spoil them but it was a fun ride overall. THe story pacing is a bit odd and the main villain's big plan doesn't make a whole lot of sense but that's the kind of stuff I can forgive in a comic book movie. Ultimately I like this movie and find the hate unnecessary. I recommend it but look at the other reviews to see if the issues are deal breakers for you.",7

"Most over hyped over rated,piece of garbage I have seen in a long time",26 April 2015,"They really need to learn from the comics. In the comic capt.America was their leader, and when they attacked they had a strategy. In the movies they simply run head first into everything, and hope it will be okay.

There's also way too much of :Oh lets stop and look at the pretty lights.when everything is about to go to hell,they constantly have this moments when they pause and look amazed at something.They are super heroes for Christ sake,get with the program. Don't just stand there save the world or what ever. They fight like a bunch of amateurs and that bore me tremendously.

Why can't they give these super heroes brain instead of just brawn. It gets so mind numbing stupid all the time. The whole Ultron thing was a nice touch but not enough to save it. ********Spoiler******************spoilers***********spoilers

Why are there so little hulk time? It seem like the main focus is to sell action figures of Thor and capt America.Cause they and Iron man is getting all the screen time.

And what was the whole thing about them socializing at parties like a bunch of fraternity kids.Even the actors looked uncomfortable with that scene,and it really wasn't needed.

The deal with showing that hawkeye had a family? Was it suppose to show depth to his character? That scene really went nowhere I for one never really cared what the superheroes were doing in their spare time,when they are not saving the world.

When did Black widow and hulk become a couple? The romance there really came out of the blue,with no explanation whatsoever. When did this start to happen? certainly not in the previous movies.

I also found it stupid that they were all forgive and forget with tony stark afterwards,even though it was his faulty creation that nearly destroyed the human kind.

The effects are great by all means you feel like you are there.But it can't save the whole concept,not for me anyway. Maybe the problem is I'm not in the target age for buying avengers merchandise.",4
A good action / special effects / super-hero movie.,20 October 2015,"This is another one of those movies that you watch primarily for the special effects with you favourite super heroes slugging it out. It is a classical Hollywood product where the story is mostly there just as a vehicle for allowing the special effects team to do their business. As such it is a success.

The movie starts of with a display of action and the afore mentioned special effects with an attack by the Avengers on a bad guy stronghold. Not surprisingly the events sows the seeds for things to come.

The movie starts off with quite an interesting story idea with the activation of Ultron. However, once he materializes as a physical entity, it became a bit of seen that, been there and done that. Ultron just turns into yet another ""standard"" comic book villain a' la Megatron running around trying to look intimidating while implementing his diabolical scheme. Okay, there was a bit of originality here and there but with the good start I kind of expected a wee bit more.

Having said that, the movie does indeed fulfil its purpose of showing off a bunch of super heroes slugging it out in a flurry of special effects and, although the story idea was perhaps not used as intelligently as I had hoped, it is not bad (for this kind of movie of course) and hangs together pretty okay. Sure, it is somewhat contrived and the means by which Ultron tries to exterminate humanity is overly complicated but it is still a decent story.

Overall the movie was entertaining and provided the necessary special effects and super hero fix for those who are inclined to enjoy those kind of movies. I certainly am and, not surprisingly, the kids liked it as well.",7

Disappointing,3 May 2015,,6
Phase 3 has begun and is looking good...,6 May 2015,"I'll just say off the bat that this movie shouldn't be judged off the hype and deepness and darkness of the story. While the film, in my opinion, surpassed the hype for the most part, it still has the lightheartedness and humour that would be expected from this series, and not the intense dark story that we all expected. That being said, I feel that is the film's only downfall, and a slight one at that.

The movie really shines in its special effects, blisteringly fast paced action sequences and its superb all-star cast. Goodbye to the classic movie formula, this one throws scenarios for epic fight scenes left right and centre, and smoothly at that. Not so much in the ""that scene wasn't necessary"" or the ""that was super cheesy and predictable"", because the movie flowed really well and kept it fresh. Humour was well placed and made it light and fun thanks to our ""world's mightiest heroes"", and the dark, chilling words spoken by our new favourite evil robots. I'll tell you, James Spader's performance was almost hypnotizing, dark and dreadful, as well as humorous at times. The other actors all had excellent chemistry and were believable despite how many amazing actors were crammed into one film.

As for the visual effects, costume design (ahem.. vision) all was excellent. It is clear that these films are digging closer and closer to their comic book roots with all the new powers and some wicked scenes that could be taken straight from the pages of a comic book. And since the visual effects are so modern and pleasing to the eye it all feels fresh and runs smoothly with the more real sets that we're used to. That being said, there is much more sweet effects than phase one and two marvel films, and I can say that GOTG and Avengers Age of Ultron both bring a brand new tone that heralds in the new phase, as well as take the audience closer to the sci-fi comic book world, and farther away from the realistic and practical heroes with easy to understand backgrounds.

For someone that's not about that kind of stuff, or who prefers and deep and Oscar- worthy script, this movie probably wouldn't warrant a high score. But I thoroughly enjoyed every bit of it, found the new characters fresh and intriguing, and more than ever am excited for what is to come, and for that I give it a 9/10.",9
A Letdown,26 April 2015,"With all the hype buzzing around for the sequel, I was hoping it to be good, but it was a letdown. The writers of the film seem to only had Marvel fans in mind, new characters were not introduced properly, and many questions left unanswered.

Maybe only 30% of movie-goers were Marvel fans, and knew what were going on. But for the majority of us, it felt like we had to google to understand what was going on. The movie started with no explanation, and the love interest started from nowhere (although we know that Black Widow would get together with Hulk eventually), it felt empty.

Besides all of that, I would give an applause for every single character had their own screen time, and not all the glory goes to Robert Downey Jr. a.k.a Tony Stark a.k.a The Iron Man. It was a fine balance that they managed to execute well.",6
Awesome!,26 April 2015,,10
If you are a big fan of the Avengers just go see it. If not read this review.,5 May 2015,"The newest addition to the Marvel comic universe falls short of some of the other recent releases. It has half the heart Guardians of the Galaxy had and even less compared to the plot of the Winter Soldier. The story feels like an afterthought and the stakes feel so much lower than they did in the first movie, even though they feel the need to constantly remind you that they ""might not make it out of this one"". Not everything is bad, The action is as good as any other large spectacle action movie and the acting is about as good as it gets for a comic book movie. The writing is hit or miss for most of the movie, and the funny banter between Avengers seems to die down toward the middle of the movie.It also has trouble finding its tone. One minute they want it to feel grounded and real, then the next minute you feel like you are watching a cartoon. The direction was unremarkable and Joss Whedons impact is felt less here than in the first movie. We may be getting spoiled with Guardians of the Galaxy and the second Captain America, but I expected much more from Age of Ultron. Every attempt to add personality to one of the characters that does not have their own separate movie feels forced and slows the movie down to a screeching halt. Finally what is up with the Hulk? First he is a reckless machine of destruction, not safe to be around unless you are basically a god. Then he can be calm and not punch everything he sees. One minute it takes some doing to get him to ""turn green"", but the next he can do it basically on a dime. Its lazy and bugs me to death. The first Avengers movie had problems, but it was awe inspiring to see all of this awesomeness on screen, but the sequel fails to reach that same peak.",6
"As intelligent, nuanced and, yes, awesome, as its titular villain",23 April 2015,"Everything seems to be settled for the team, making room for more infighting as this goes for psychological thriller in their individual nightmares being forced to the surface. Each of them have their own drama and interpersonal relationships, all effective and compelling, yet incredibly well-balanced with the near-constant humor and huge, creative and unforgettable action as this doesn't take itself too seriously. A certain genius creates a powerful A.I., failing to realize that this is based on a comic book, so, duh, it's going to Sky-Net on them, and this manages to avoid feeling cliché. Ultron(Spader, in the unusual, for him, not-perverted role, but intensely creepy nonetheless) is the first bad guy in the MCU(did I mention this is the best one yet?) to be as compelling as Loki.

This somehow manages to be both jam-packed with detail yet not overwhelming, deliver on an incredible amount of the dense, and well-utilized continuity, and, somehow, actually allow newcomers in. I kid you not, you can go into this completely blind. Sure, you'll have to pay close attention, but it's doable, and where ""Guardians"" told and did not show, this does the opposite, spending little time explaining, and rather just letting us see how everything and everyone works. Everything you need to know to follow it is in there – think Star Trek, as you watch, you'll understand more and more, and it doesn't really throw anything you can't at all follow at you until you've seen a lot to set it up for the payoff and yet, it doesn't feel constrained by that. This delivers from frame 1: we start in the middle of a major attack! A ton has happened between movies, and we quickly pick up on it, and this establishes, develops and uses every element, be it big or small.

There is a lot of disturbing content and, mostly mild, violence, a little of it genuinely getting nightmarish and inching close to an R and yes, the language does occasionally get strong, and the film teases the MPAA by pointing out the amount and where that line is drawn. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys going to the theater, albeit the 3D is entirely optional. 10/10",10

A good mix of original plot lines from the comics with Whedon's version of the Avengers,26 April 2015,"There's only one minor fault stopping this one from being a real perfect 10. I think it's once again stemming from the need to push on the franchise in sequels to come, but there're way too many small guest appearances of secondary roles that have nothing to do in this action packed film. Yes the Avengers in the comic book tend to change teams' make up, that doesn't mean you have to remind us all the new guys before they take a bigger role in the coming sequel, there's enough plot lines in this film as is, without silly cameos of say War machine. All other aspects of this movie work like magic. It's another perfect combination of well written characters, good acting - Scarlett Johansson, tops my list, but almost everybody here is superb. The story line once again, like all good comics, dwells also on moral issues, which are part of the raison d'etre of sci-fi comics. Editing, CGI, and all other technical aspects of this production are as perfect as we come to expect them. So bottom line - one more good comics adaptation - Whedon does understand the source material so well he knows what he can borrow from the original plot lines to make it just close enough to the comics we all love.",9

That being said the movies after The Avengers just keep getting better and better and Avengers: Age of Ultron is no exception . This is way more exciting than the original. The action sequences are done on a much bigger scale and the dialogue is fantastic. The plot is also much interesting than the first.

Too many ingredients and not enough time to cook!,24 April 2015,,6
A loud but very good super sequel,29 April 2015,"Rating-8/10

Avengers: Age of Ultron is a Marvel made sequel that ties up what we want from not only the first movie, but the entire cinematic universe under Marvel. Age of Ultron is a very good sequel and also one that improves upon It too with the people behind the scenes and on camera too all making a big improvement. It builds upon what we saw in the first movie and then improves it and opens up a whole new can of worms in which I am sure will feature heavily in future movies in the series and elsewhere.

The film is not only incredibly loud, but also just generally a big film and you really don't get too much bigger than this one. The fighting, the special effects and even the cast are just big, and with such a huge budget for a movie(around or just over $250 million) you can't really expect any less. As I mentioned the cast, well yes Thor is huge and the Hulkbut what I mean is we see so many new characters and people and even random extras, this is just hugely epic and one that doesn't shy from giving many people the spotlight.

On to the cast at acting now and they all come back well and one point that really sticks out is that no one character or actor stands out, they stand their ground and stick to it hard. The cast are stylish as ever and also even funnier with of course not only Robert Downey Jr as Tony Stark/Iron man cracking the jokes but also Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo and a surprisingly funny Don Cheadle who really works well with the rest of the avengers and makes you really chuckle quite a bit.

And now onto the funny bits, well to be fair there are too many to mention. This is truly typical Marvel comedy but probably or maybe possibly at that the funniest film by them and all credit goes to not only the actors but also Joss Whedon for creating and directing the great lines. Whedon is the true mastermind and blends the humour well with the more serious moments, and although it can seem a little too jumpy between each, it still pays off.

I will say this movie is slightly overly futuristic and can feel like the Sci-Fi meter is off the charts. It feels a bit random as we do expect though as lasers and incredibly big spaceships, weapons etc etc join the fight. Now yes you can say ""but they have superpowers, it isn't meant to be realistic"", but see the ships they use and you'll understand me. One thing to add is also that Whedon doesn't rely on bringing back the same old from the past movie which if they had been in, it would have been crazily over sci-fi and the effects would have gone haywire with every scenes seeming unbelievable at best.

Overall though the film is a fine movie and of course as said, very good indeed. It's an improvement and on that, I can't see many claiming the first Avengers was the best, Age of Ultron thoroughly steps up in many different areas. It ranks highly on the roster of Marvel films and with Marvel throwing out movies left right and centre, you can't help feel will this be remembered, but the answer is probably yes. Yes the Avengers really are at the epicentre of the Marvel cinematic universe and with all these phases that Marvel/Disney put together, this movie shows that the next phases and the next movies in this series can be very much looked forward too.",8
What an experience,26 April 2015,"I went to see 'Avengers: Age of Ultron' Thursday in imperial, and what an experience!

I think the film had more to offer than the first one. The villain is more complex than Loki and the whole story of the movie is a little deeper. You get a little more insight into the different characters and a little background history for some of them. Ultron as character was insane bold, I love his attitude. The heroes is still super cool and I was entertained the whole movie through. The humor is of course still really good, like its predecessor

This is one of those films to be seen in the cinema, the sound and the big screen makes the experience amazing. The film's animation is the crazy nice, the whole movie is really nice.

I give 'Avengers: Age of Ultron' 7 out of 10 stars. You take the film for what it is and it's a cool superhero movies, with little depth and character development. I can't wait for the next movie after this sequel!",7

"A fun, deja vu experience",21 April 2015,"Avengers : The Age of Ultron - A fun deja vu experience - 4 stars

They're back to save the world, but can they save themselves?

Walking into the cinema... The Avengers was so good, can Age of Ultron live up to the original?

Overall Rating: 4 stars Cinematic value: 3.5 stars Big questions value: 4.5 stars

Sometimes in the search for peace, mankind can cause more problems than solutions. It is not much different for The Avengers. In the newest chapter in the lives of our favourite band of superheroes, they have been left to manage the world's villains. After retrieving and studying Loki's sceptre, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) sees the opportunity to create the ultimate peacekeeper, Ultron (James Spader). In short order, he plan goes awry and Stark's arrogance creates to a seemingly omnipotent villain who seeks the eradication of mankind. In his masterplan for mankind's demise, Ultron successfully divides the superhero force. The Avengers have to determine how they can battle the demons inside themselves, as well as this new force of evil in the world.

Deja vu is the sensation that a current event or experience has happened previously. It is not necessarily a negative experience, but merely an awareness of the experience. Watching Avengers: The Age of Ultron was a deja vu experience. The original Avengers film was a brilliant mix of superhero personalities, action and humour and the superhero crew is back again.In this new adventure the action is back and director Joss Whedon continues to give a comedic spin that was experienced in the original film. This version was not bad experience, but seeing The Age of Ultron does conjure up a 'been there, done that' feeling. Whedon does enough to add new components and develop key characters to give the story a fresh spin, but it is built on the original story formula. Being aware that most of the character's stories are developed in their individual films, there is minimal opportunity for substantive character development. The development of Hawkeye's story line did add a needed human touch to the film, but the awkward relationship development between key characters within the team lacked appeal. James Spader adds an effective villainous element to the Ultron character, but is left with the inevitable trap of monologuing blunders that plague supervillians. Ultron is a profile villain and Spader is right for the lead villain role, but the character that would have been worth developing is Ulysses Klaw (Andy Serkis). Hopefully, he will be reintroduced in the future. We get to meet new characters, but with the exception of Vision, they present as one dimensional and fail to add much to the story. One new spin on this story is that the majority of the action occurs outside of the United States. So other countries get to experience the devastation of having the super powers fighting in their local community. The action is spectacular and heart stopping at times, but the future films will need to find other means of assisting with humanities salvation that do not include the total annihilation of large cityscapes. Avengers: The Age of Ultron met many of the expectations for the follow up to the first chapter of this hero chronology by successfully entertaining the audience with the action and cheeky dialogue, but it did not offer much new to the franchise or genre. In the end, Avengers: The Age of Ultron was an enjoyable deja vu experience.

Even though somethings were unoriginal, an enjoyable element of this hero adventure was found in the script. Whedon and crew must have a Bible nearby, because it became a key resource for content. Ultron was given some of the best lines of the film and many of them referred to or directly quoted key passages from the accounts of Noah and Jesus. The script was not a theological exercise, by any means, but the whispers of God's meta- narrative were evident throughout the film. As with all super hero films, the key story relies on the world's need of a saviour or, in the case of The Avengers, saviours. Whedon manages to show that these heroes are fallible. Unlike Jesus, who is the example of the infallible Saviour, the writing manages to expose the Avengers imperfections and weaknesses. One key example is found in their desire for peace and security. The Avengers answer to world peace seems brilliant and effective, but proves to be problematic. Which opens the door to many considerations of who can be relied upon, if these heroes prove to be susceptible to failure? This is one example amongst many, but does set The Age of Ultron up to be a good mix of discussion points that make this film an engaging experience.

Leaving the cinema... After the supernova of The Avengers, can the expectation be too high for Avengers: The Age of Ultron? Sure it is, but Marvel has set the bar. Does Joss Whedon rise to the challenge? Yes, he manages to get the job done in his second outing in the franchise. It was action packed, funny and unbelievably exciting, but the franchise will need a fresh fuel line of ideas to keep it from stalling in the future. Go to enjoy the adventure, but do not expect too many surprises.

What are some of the bigger questions to consider from this film? 1. What is the way to 'real' peace? (Matthew 10:34-36, 2 Thessalonians 3:16) 2. Can we become 'better humans?' (Genesis 1:27, Mark 7:20-23) 3. What does the Bible have to say about working together as a team? (Ecclesiastes 4: 9- 12, 1 Corinthians 12: 20-25)",

Marvel's first misfire,24 April 2015,,4
Worst Marvel Movie (6.0),29 January 2021,"I guess this is the most disliked movie among marvel movies. The whole movie seems ridiculous and unnecessary to me. I wish Marvel never made a movie like this of course had some gains like Wanda and Vision, but it doesn't change the fact that it's a pretty boring movie.

The effects are bad, the battle scenes are bad, the whole Sokovia episode is pretty unnecessary for some reason I can't like this movie and finally, I wish Quicksilver hadn't died and he had a good place in the Marvel world, I think it would have gotten a lot of attention.",6
Earth's greatest entertainers....,10 May 2015,"The imminent darkness looms just outside the nine realms with evil forces conjuring greater power to seize control. Back on Earth, after New York, the Avengers have been busy eradicating HYDRA from their secret lairs in an attempt to establish peace. With innocent lives being lost to worldwide terrorism everyday, Earth needed many more protectors and there was but one solution in Tony Stark's genius mind. His artificial intelligence program was to be duplicated using the neuron flow from Loki's scepter to create a sentinel army of droids. It was thus, that his plan backfired and the 'Age of Ultron' threatened the existence of not only the Avengers but also of the planet. Joss Whedon's challenge was to keep the mayhem from becoming another Michael Bay extravaganza while also making it disparate from The Avengers. There are new characters, more powerful villains and of course, more Smash!

An introduction to our heroes was completely unnecessary and therefore, the film begins in hyper-active mode in Sokovia, where the Avengers make their way through a Nazi hideout to retrieve Loki's scepter. We are already seeing signs of evolution with their enhanced weapons and in certain cases, relationships. During the raid, they discover two new super-villains who have been enhanced to become Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen). While they were unable to capture them, they decide to celebrate the success anyway and throw a lavish party at Stark's downtown apartment. Meanwhile, Stark and Banner secretly attempt to harness the nucleus like energy from the scepter and combine it with the A.I. of Jarvis. At the end of a hilarious scene where the superheroes gather around Thor's Mjolnir to try lifting it, their party is interrupted by a half built robot that not only speaks intelligently while threatening them but escapes through the internet to gather its own destructive army. Ultron (James Spader's voice) is perhaps the sharpest of villains and in his impeccable robotic body, poses as a menacing form of evil that desires mass extinction. The enhanced twins, Pietro and Wanda Maximoff already have an established hatred for Stark and his allies. Ultron fuels this hatred and unleashes their power of speed and mental manipulation upon the mightiest heroes to subdue them and send them into hiding. In that process, Hulk goes berzerk in Johannesburg, only to be challenged by Ironman's Hulksmasher. Their vulnerability has caused the loss of lives and property and it's great to see that the Earth's mightiest heroes show such concern.

Ultron's need to evolve brings the action to Seoul, where he builds his perfect body but is intercepted at just the right time by the Avengers. Stark's overconfidence in his genius then leads to the creation of a super-hero that has a human-like A.I. and Asgardian worthiness. Now as part of his plan to cause human extinction, Ultron literally uproots a Sokovian city, to bring it down like an asteroid that would send shockwaves across the globe. It's Ultron's centries of robotic perfection against Earth's mightiest heroes who are now more responsbile than ever for human life.

3 of the Avengers have had sequels since they were first united. Astutely, Whedon chooses to focus on the rest of the members along with the newbies. That does not mean that our heroes haven't evolved during this period. Tony Stark feels more responsible for his team's success and pushes his limits both mentally and physically. Captain America seems stronger and his shield now acts like a boomerang too! As the team leader, he is the moral pillar who dictates battle strategies that reduce collateral damage. Thor senses some greater powers being responsible for the recent attacks on Midgard and linking the infinity gem in the plot only corroborates his suspicion. Bruce Banner's guilt ridden conscience is the result of all the lives lost during the big guy's rampage. It makes him distance himself from Widow's affection which is quite irresistible. Black Widow appreciates this vulnerability of Banner and the fact that he's a superhero who doesn't want his power. Clint has a surprising reveal and that is a successful play by the film makers to divert some attention to the human side of the Avengers. James Spader's devillish voice makes Ultron all the more sinister. Sophisticated, evolved yet sly in his verbal attacks with the heroes, Ultron makes a menacing villain for being a robot. Perhaps the most striking new character is Vision, with his calm, composed voice that makes him seem ethereal. More powerful than the rest, he doesn't exude those characteristics but can defeat most beings in a battle. Newcomers Aaron Taylor-Johnson and the ravishing Elizabeth Olsen are excellent as the Maximoff twins.

Joss Whedon keeps the action frenetic yet stays with his characters so the audience isn't overwhelmed. Just like Tony Stark, this movie pushes the limits and in a good way. There's more destruction and nerdy fun than many movies put together but it also has a softer human side with characters that are very well developed by now. The humorous banter, genuine threat to their existence and compassion for human lives make this film's core. The superlative CGI (apart from the opening sequence), detailed action sequences and overall mayhem make up the delicious outer layer. Age of Ultron takes us deeper into the Marvel Universe and lays a solid foundation for whatever is in store with the future installments. The elevator may not be worthy of Mjolnir but the Avengers are worth repeated viewings.",10
"the quarterpounder or ""europes royal"" of movie making",7 May 2015,"You need to taste it, you get sated soon, but after a while you feel hungry again. that sums ""age of ultron"" up for me in one sentence.

The soul of ""guardians of the galaxy"" or ""the avengers"" are not there anymore, which is OK for me, but don't try to make out more of age of ultron.

The movie achieves what it is made for, money and the viewer gets a good show for said money, i'm willing to pay for entertainment, art or just a good show, whatever you wanna call it. now and then i really need something different with a touch of soul and i hope the creative people behind those cash bags are content with letting that creativity of themselves the hell out time and time again/without restrictions. they need to do it, cause without that there won't be the like of a guardians or a winter soldier in the future.

Without that we'll stop talking about ""Fast Food Movies"" and just consume, which might lighten the cash bags in the long run. you remember the ""pulp fiction"" scene where mr. travolta explains what a quaterpounder is called in europe? good. i can remember a good meal anytime, even the people with whom i was eating, the place, the time, my emotional state and so on. mr. jackson earlier or that depends on your view, later in the movie tastes one burger, the burger just tasted fine, thats it. you can talk about names or prizes, it can taste good or bad, you perhaps remember the wait in a drive in line, but what else really?

Hopefully the creative minds behind those things cannot be caged for every movie they gonna do in the future, use the money, throw it not just away. be bold when it comes to hard creative or technical choices.

Ah and i'll pay for a good burger anytime, if i'm in the mood. to be honest i can't recall any bad fast food, i know i've eating it in my live, but everything else about it just vanishes.",6

Awesome Movie,25 April 2015,"Wow! Wow! Wow! this is what you are going to make while watching this movie...Its Avengers !! They are Back! so forget the plot and enjoy the ride with your favorite super heroes.. Awesomeness all over it. But not up to the former one, which i badly missed to watch in screens then.. Watch it with kids amusement .You are gonna love it. For me, Iron Man is just a peace of metal and Thor is a blacksmith with a hammer, if the roles are not played by Robert Downey Jr and Chris Hemsworth.. cant imagine any others to represent these roles. Other members Chris Evans as Captain America , Mark Ruffalo as The Incredible Hulk and Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow have done a very Good Job to entertain us. If you are a person who only sit and stare at screen until the end credits may be this is not one for you.. Grab some friends and make some noise!",9
I will be in the minority of this one but without any type of suspense I wonder how much longer can they keep me interested?,1 October 2015,"""Peace in our time, imagine that."" After finally taking control of Loki's staff, Tony Stark (Downey Jr.) begins to run tests on it in hopes of being able to harness it's energy for his personal use. The good news is is that his idea worked. The bad news is is that he accidentally created Ultron (Spader) who wants to save the world by destroying it. Now, with the help of the rest of the Avengers they most stop Ultron from creating total destruction, but in-fighting within the group starts to derail the mission. Once again I will start by saying that I am not a huge fan of this whole Marvel Universe series. One reason is that I was never a huge comic book fan, the other (and main reason) is that because of all the planned movies we have been told about there is no suspense watching these. Other series like X-Men and (depending on how you view it) Batman have killed off major characters. Once one of the major characters dies it gives you a sense of, holy crap what's going to happen now. I'm not saying the movie would be better if Iron Man gets hit with something and dies. I am saying that knowing that in the next few years there will be another Captain America movie (Iron man will be in this one), a new Thor, 2 more Avengers as well as many many more featuring smaller characters in this movie takes away any suspense the movie tries for. The characters in this movie start to fight with each other, but knowing that next year they will all work together again makes that scene seem pointless. These movies are all review proof so nothing I say will change you mind about watching it or not, but I think the total saturation of this genre is starting to get to me and I am fast losing interest in these movies. I will be in the minority of this one but to me this was boring and without any type of suspense I was wondering how much longer can these story lines keep me interested? Overall, another Avengers movie...is there anything else to say? I give this a B-.",6

Not as good as the first one but definitely entertaining and fun to watch (WORTH IT),26 April 2015,"this film is expected to be one of the best marvel films of all time but turns out its not. definitely not the best but still worth it. although what i mean is ""Not that good"" its because it feels bland and lack of excitement unlike the other marvel studio films like winter soldier,GOTG and IronMan1.but really worth the shot especially the action sequences. gotta admit captain America's moves is the best! better than the last avengers this one really got the super soldier moves and not to mention his tag team with Thor now thats freaking awesome cant wait to see more of them. but the rest somethings really wrong or not right at all. i felt like less iron-man in it,ultron not really that strong and threatening,the black widow and banner relationship(doesn't make sense at all) and the quicksilver,scarlet witch, vision underdeveloped characters,but the rest they're still great and as a hardcore marvel fanboy i'd give this film a 7/10 looking forward to civil war and MORE!",7

"""The City Is Flying, We're Fighting An Army Of Robots, And I Have A Bow And Arrow""",16 April 2021,,6
Even Better Than the First,4 May 2015,"With the cursory introduction period now behind us, the team is finally able to shift into what's made them so appealing to readers for so many years: their personal relationships, both on and off the battlefield. Of course, with more characters than ever it also runs the risk of overdoing it and crowding the screen, but that's not a problem at all: Joss Whedon manages to get everyone their moment in the sun in a simple, organic way. I was particularly impressed by the amount of time dedicated to Hawkeye and the Black Widow, not coincidentally the two members of the team without solo flicks of their own, and how effective they were at transforming the characters into essential human components of a squad so thoroughly populated by gods among men. Ultron is an intriguing foil, backed by a magnificent voice-over from James Spader, though his threat is often undermined by odd off-the-cuff remarks that, while amusing, make him seem more snarky than sinister. The screenplay is effortlessly cool and funny and rich, though, with staggeringly giant set pieces and no shortage of ballsy, CG-leaning action. A few plot threads could've used more exploration, particularly Thor's spirit quest in the second act, but with so many moving pieces I'm not sure how it could've been done in a reasonable amount of time. In short, The Age of Ultron is everything it advertised and more, an all-stops home run swing that made me giddy to be alive in an age where something so close to my heart could be translated so literally to living color on the big screen. My only reservation stepping out of the theater was that I'd have to wait years to catch the next.",9
Lost the way,15 May 2015,"Its obvious to compare between the first installment and the second. I found this movie visually confusing while the plot was plain and boring without much twist which you expect when Loki is there. The villain here is the AI Ultron whose algorithm is set at destroying the earth for instilling peace. That is confusing in itself. We have seen such movies where a robot or AI has gone bad a zillion times. The problem is the predictability of the story.

While it was nice to have a complicated little love story between The Hulk and Black Widow and an unexpected discovery of family of one of the Avengers. It seemed as if this movie was just a bridge between the upcoming movies. The fight sequences reminded me of I, Robot. So many things could have been possible with such powerful AI getting into the world wide web... He could have played God, he could have commanded the earth population. Instead he wants to delete earth from the face of the solar system.

The Avengers seemed like a bunch of high school students...party freaks, unsure, broken hearted and angry. There were too many things packed in each shot and it was difficult to focus on the characters.. like when two characters are talking there are 2-3 non participating lead actors strolling around or conversing amongst themselves or something non important is happening in the background. The background score is also changed. The new one is unimpressive. They should have stuck with the original score to maintain continuity.

All in all its a one time watch",7
Fun with Marvel and the family,4 May 2015,"This is an action movie with Marvel characters: once you understand that nothing will go wrong and you will like this movie. I was avid Marvel reader much before these movies came along, I do not feel betrayed at all, I think this movie captures the essence of the comics. My only critic is that it is too long, I would have avoided the lengthy scenes of droid battles (reminding of Star Wars episode 1, rather better to be forgotten instead of recalled). It is however fun to watch and actually one of the few movies the whole family can enjoy. The scenes may at times be slightly scary for a 10 year old, but from 11 years on the kid will actually love it, as my three children did.",8
An underwhelming sequel,15 April 2023,"""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" is a superhero movie that features an ensemble cast of characters, including Iron Man, Captain America, and Thor, among others. The film sees the Avengers fighting against a powerful AI named Ultron, who has gone rogue and threatens the world.

Overall, I thought the movie was decent but forgettable. While it had some exciting action scenes and witty banter between the characters, it lacked the emotional depth and stakes of some of the other films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The plot felt a bit convoluted at times, and Ultron's motivations were not always clear.

That being said, there were still some standout moments in the movie. The introduction of new characters like Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver added some fresh dynamics to the group, and the scene where the Avengers attempt to lift Thor's hammer was a fun and memorable moment.

All in all, I would give ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" a 6 out of 10. While it was an enjoyable enough movie to watch, it ultimately failed to leave a lasting impression.",6
Bigger and better but less funnier,26 April 2015,"I am a huge fan of the Avengers. The first edition stole me totally. Thanks to Star Movies in India, I have watched it so many times that I literally can repeat each dialog like a subtitle. It has some of the best lines and the aversion between characters before they can become a group has been impacting and immediate.

Coming to AOU, I have had huge expectations. Am I disappointed? Well, I am excited than disappointed on what future holds. The big question I wanted answering was, where is Loki when the world he despises is burning? The character of Loki adds so much to the movie along with Ironman for the wittiness. Why the dialogs weren't as memorable as the first one ( I am sorry, the subtitles killed it for me to remember if there are any). But from the action side, it is total kick ass. The enhancement to the other sides of the Hulk and the BW has added the character depth that was missing in the first part. SLJ, could have had more screen space IMO, but that's OK. The action sequences at the first, the Iron-Hulk stand off and the chase are beautifully handled.

Whether it is better than the first is debatable, but it is totally worth every buck you pay to watch it and every minute you spent watching. Total awesomeness and some more!",9
Good,15 May 2021,"The new production involving the best-known Marvel heroes, is once again well produced. We have a good dose of action, scenes with excellent effects and of course, a lot of humor among the gang, especially on the side of Tony Stark. The Avengers now have an even bigger, much more dangerous mission. Ultron, that is the name of the concern. One of the new characters within the universe, who still presents us with Scarlet Witch and Mercury. And not leaving aside Vision. Visually well designed, it shows unusual powers alongside experienced colleagues. The ending is interesting, it actually shows that the class will be reformulated, and it leaves a little stardom for the medallions of the current tape.",7
A new vision,4 May 2015,,8
Downgrade from the original,15 February 2017,"The Avengers: Age of Ultron is the highly expected sequel to the cultural impactful classic of 2012's The Avengers. within Age of Ultron, you can feel the burden of all this heavy lifting threatening to crush writer-director Joss Whedon, who, by comparison, had it easy the first time out, in The Avengers. His task this time: Show the Avengers, Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Bruce Banner/the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Clint Barton/Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) to be working together as a team; drive a wedge between them through Stark's creation of a peacekeeping AI called Ultron (voiced by James Spader) that turns against them; develop a romance between Natasha and Banner; flesh out Hawkeye, the regular Joe and, to this point, the most under-developed member of the group; introduce new characters, such as the twins Pietro Maximoff/Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and Wanda Maximoff/Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen). This already can seem like a lot, where as the plot is somewhat sort of messy. It is still entertaining but when comparing Age of Ultron to the original, everything about the original has this film beat.

Age of Ultron is a good watch but it's hard to ignore certain boring or forced scenes. As many have said, this film being disappointing only lifts up expectations for the next Avengers film in the franchise. And we all know, the hype level and expectations for the third film will be quite high. ===== As a rewatch (05/05/18') Age of Ultron is a decent watch but at time overwhelming and parts of certain boring. With many uninteresting subplots, action is there but some parts remain not as great. Opinions and voting remain same after a year of second viwing.",6

Fanboy Nirvana (Spoilers),28 April 2015,,
An OK follow-up..,10 October 2015,"After reading so many negative reviews and actually watching the movie in theaters the second week it came out, I cant say I don't agree with them.. but I cant also say they're completely right. While this movie disappoints on some aspects, (like it having a different vibe than the movie we expected from watching the trailer) there are some redeemable stuff from AoU.

The good: Id have to say the action. The action was pretty good, we got more from hulk, Ultron has his moments, I'll get more into that in a bit, Iron Man gets a new suit and the Hulkbuster scene was probably the greatest battle in the movie. Also it was great to see how Quicksilver and Wanda's powers played out, Paul Bettany's the Vision was great and the original cast was great this time around.

The Bad: Like I said the trailer showed us the different vibe than what we saw in the trailer. Ultron wasn't as menacing (the only thing that saved him was having being voiced by James Spader) but he kind of took tension off of the movie thanks to also having a sarcastic humor. The heroes also took tension off from the final battle. When you face the villain's plan in wiping out all of humanity taking place you don't just start cracking jokes .. you just don't. Like how would X-men's DoFP played out if the final battle with the sentinels killing off our heroes one by one consisted of the surviving mutants cracking jokes. you get the idea. Moving on.. the plot feels a little overstuffed with characters adding Quicksilver, Scarlet Witch and The Vision into the mix. On that note, Quicksilver was very underused (and you will find out why, since I decided to keep this review spoiler free).

All in all, despite the flaws, go watch it. Still a worthy sequel panning out the road for Civil War next summer.",7
Best Marvel movie? Not Quite.,26 April 2015,"Being a huge Marvel fan I went in to watch a bada$$ Ultron ripping apart the Avengers and totally owning them. Many people may not know how brutal Ultron really is and can be. So expectations went surging high when I saw the trailer. The scene when a damaged bot ruins the after party of the Earth's mightiest by pretty intimidating lines, laid the foundation of a menacing villain, defeating whom would be a close to impossible task. Yet in the movie Ultron is pretty less intimidating that expected.

The movie is exactly what Marvel is famous for. Amazing action sequences with well knitted humor. I loved each and every Avenger and it was commendable how each of them got enough screen time. I personally would like to thank the makers to show us more of Hawkeye/Barton as he came off as the most under used character in the Marvel movies up until now. Hawkeye is a great comic book character with many skills and abilities under his sleeve and also known to be witty and full of humor. Though in movies his part is overshadowed by the likes of Stark, Rogers and Thor. The costume of Captain America was hands down the best. Thor and Captain are chiseled to perfection! Won't talk about Tony stark as I didn't find him impressive at all except for when he was wearing the suit. I guess that decides who I am going to support in Civil War. #TeamCapAmr

I loved Elizabeth Olsen and Aaron as The Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver. Though these names were never used in the movie. And was quite amazed that they got more than decent screen time. Scarlet is a powerful character and I hope they use her more in the movies to come.

To be honest, I was expecting a Black Panther teaser in the movie as Klaw is involved. Though I wasn't relying on it. Klaw is another important character in Marvel universe and is surely going to be in the Black Panther movie.

Vision is iconic. They couldn't have made it any better. Though he should have been involved in more spectacular action sequences towards the end, like rampaging a whole lot of those Ultron bots at once. He is capable of massive destruction, a whole lot more than what was shown in the movie. He is going to be a key character later on, when Thanos arrives.

Hulk vs Iron Man is the best action scene in the movie. Yep, it is. It was so gripping that I didn't want it to end. I was cheering all through the movie but the dual between Hulkbuster and Hulk was when I got a sore throat.

Coming back to Ultron, I felt his story was a bit rushed. Did the editor cut out a few key scenes of Ultron's character development? I think editing was indeed required as the movie would have easily crossed 3 hour mark. So can't really complain, but still I personally feel the story of a villain like Ultron needs proper development. According to the Avengers Animated series and comic books, Hank Pym and Tony Stark are creators of Ultron, Hank being more involved. Hank Pym of course is the Ant Man, and the Ultron is largely made up of his brain patterns. But Marvel movie story line is taking a different route. It's OK, as it doesn't really matter what story they take as long as most of the audience enjoys the movie. The movie is full of scream worthy moments but maybe short of expectations of any Marvel fan. By the way did anyone else notice a few moments from the trailer were missing in the actual movie? Also I didn't quite get the part where Thor goes dipping in the pool. It wasn't explained properly I guess or maybe I need to watch it again.

Is the movie a must watch? Hell yeah! Is it the best Marvel movie? Debatable given the likes of Winter Soldier and Guardians of the Galaxy. The movie sure is going to earn a lot, as if that's a surprise but a few changes in the movie would have made it even more amazing.",8
"An entertaining movie, but suffers from a variety of problems",7 June 2015,"* WARNING MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS!* Avengers: Age of Ultron is a decent movie, which provided me with a fairly entertaining movie to kill two and a half hours with, but it was a bit disappointing when compared with the original. One problem I (and a lot of people apparently) had was that there were too many characters and plot lines to keep up with. Thor is hardly in the movie at times (seriously, did anyone see him in the finale?). I also thought the finale dragged, because it was just watching the Avengers smash robots who couldn't even give them any opposition. Most will disagree, but the light-hearted tone of the MCU is wearing very thin, and can really spoil the tension. The positives are that its really fun, has good characters, and a it is funny at times. I think the most well-written scenes are those between Black Widow and Hulk, though their romance feels a little out of the blue. If you like the light-hearted tone, you'll probably like this more, but if you don't, I can't see you liking this movie.",7
"Good watch, and expected by now",10 May 2015,"We start off the Summer blockbuster fiasco with Marvel's colossal Avengers franchise. The only film franchise of its kind to date where most of its members drop more successful solo projects than the Wu-Tang Clan. I was anticipating this film as was half of the world to see what the super-villain Ultron could bring to the table.

The story is based on Tony and Bruce (Ironman & non-Hulk in case you didn't know) concocting a plan to create highly evolved Artificial Intelligence in order to keep the world protected like TSA 10.0, but plans fall apart when the A.I. that they birthed concocts plans of his own.

First off, the action in this film is great. All the fight scenes are energetic and I only found complications during a fight scene on a freight liner because of the dark shaky cam.

I loved the interaction of the team during the party scene at the Avengers headquarters. It shows how much they jelled as a team since the first film. I also enjoyed that they didn't put a heavy investment of time on only the bigger heroes such as Ironman and Captain America, but they did a neat little back story on Hawkeye, helping to pull him away from just being a filler character, but just as important as the other members.

The introduction of Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver was also a decent addition, even though I believe Evan Peters played a much better Quicksilver in X-men: Days of Future Past. Aaron Taylor-Johnson seems to coast through the role, but Elizabeth Olsen nailed it as his much cooler sister putting most of the Avengers through fear hallucinations.

Speaking of hallucinations, she was able to put a spell on the Hulk that absolutely drove him mad as he tore through a city in what seemed like a meth-high. I would've loved to have seen what the Hulk saw since we know so little about what would scare the beast.

This movie was jam-packed with pluses, but it did have a few downers. On the preview for the films they depicted Ultron as being this Sinister cold robot that was hell-bent on world destruction, but I didn't get that after watching the movie. His opening scene when we first see him in physical form, taking on the scraps of many of Tony Starks robots, it was pretty creepy seeing him limping around and philosophizing slavery and being a puppet.

Once Ultron creates a body for himself all that seems like it goes out the window. I was hoping he would come off as more Darth Vader with his ideals, but it felt more like a used car salesman. It felt like he was humanized down to a sleaze ball that lies in your face then winks at you just so you he just lied.

Also, I wasn't too crazy about how vision looked. I get it, he's supposed to be a Cybernetic Organism, but..he looked too much like a human in a human suit.I think if they removed his pupils like they did in the comic book we would see an equal balance with his robot side.

I'm also tired of them rescuing people. No, I'm not some jerk that thinks they should ignore the helpless, but if you read the comic these wars didn't have random bystanders all over the place. It just loses focus on the action when they constantly have to do the ""rescue the baby in the carriage"" routine. I say lets take the battle to space. From the clip after the credits, hopefully it will lead to that.

Overall Grade: B

Even though this was a good film, I feel like I'm overdosing on Avenger- related movies. They feel like their all stretching and filling at the same time. Maybe I'm just ready for the Infinity Wars to start so I get through the next 20 movies that will preface it.

Also, if Ultron had less of a human personality and was just a cold A.I. sentient that didn't give me the feeling of a mattress salesman trying to get months-end commission, the villainous side of this film would have shot up notch. Follow me at www.danielortizrants.wordpress.com",8
Earth's Mightiest Heroes Struggle to Save This Script,6 May 2015,"Before I saw ""The Avengers: Age of Ultron"", I had read somewhere that Joss Whedon's first cut of the film was over three hours long, and that it had been pared down to the 2:21 release that is in theaters now. It shows.

This is a movie that sacrifices good story telling for action, and comes very close to being an epic fail for the Marvel Cinematic Universe franchise. My main beef with the film is that the plot is poorly scripted. At its core, movie making is storytelling. A good story can be ruined if it isn't told properly, and that's what happened with ""Age of Ultron"". The plot of the movie is just fine--indeed, it's a creative way to introduce some new characters and lead up to the battle with Ultron, the film's main antagonist.

But the problem is that the entire first half of the film is severely underdeveloped in terms of how the plot is conveyed. The audience is made to leap right into the plot with very little in the way of development of new characters, or even of Ultron himself. Would this film have called for a full on ""2001"" HAL-esque treatment of the character so that his evil intent is only revealed halfway through the film? No. But in ""Age of Ultron"", we go from the character being conceived, to being brought online, to being the embodiment of evil all in a brief five minutes of the film. (Not to mention that the cinematography there conjured up images of the most egregious of terrible scenes from the LOTR/Hobbit movies).

Another beef I had with the film was the treatment of the Scarlet Witch, a.k.a. Wanda Maximoff. Wanda's telekinetic ability to produce delusions in her opponents plays a very large role in the early half of the film. Two things about that: my memory of Scarlet Witch from my time reading Avengers as a youth would suggest that this was never a prominent part of her arsenal of powers, so it was strange to see that ability given such a large amount of attention in the film. Second, the way that it was done was just odd in terms of cinematography. The warped delusions of human characters mixed with the oddball scene of Ultron coming online made the first half of the film very hard to watch for me.

That said, the movie did improve as the two-plus hours went along--which was a good thing. Some movies make you bite your nails because you're wondering what will happen next. This movie made me bite my nails because I was hoping it would get better and not be a complete and utter failure.

And it did. The second half of the film is notably better than the first, which would suggest that most of the editorial changes that Whedon made may have come from the first half of the movie. Some commentators are arguing that he was indeed forced to trim the large chunk of time out of the movie. If that's the case then it's a pity, as twenty more minutes of back story would have made this movie much more enjoyable, and forty minutes could have filled in the gaps enough that it would have been on par with the rest of the MCU films.

Whatever the case, the film finishes stronger than it begins. But it still suffers overall. To once again make the comparison to storytelling, a story that ends well and with great excitement but forgets to share much at all about its main characters on the front end will inevitably cause the audience not to be emotionally invested in the story overall.

Perhaps Marvel thought that with so many of its characters having already been introduced at this point that they could get a free pass on the background information on the front end of the film--and if that was the rationale, then they would be right on that point. Captain America, Thor, the Hulk, these characters didn't need any further explanation of who they are. But Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch, Ultron, etc. did. And the plot at large did, as well, rather than just throwing the audience into a mess of a film that even Earth's Mightiest Heroes struggle to save.

Oh--and now that I think about it, the whole gist of the Vision's character was poorly communicated as well. Just bad storytelling all the way around on this one, even if the story itself was good.

A last note--I'm not someone to get upset over profanity, but Marvel has taken a strange approach as its film franchise has continued to grow. This film, like so many like it from the latter half of the MCU, tries to make itself both kid friendly and humorous, and yet also pepper in a dozen or so cuss words throughout the film. That just makes for a strange movie-going experience all the way around. I get that Marvel's main target audience is teens and adults, but they're also very clearly marketing their films to children. The language thing is a real issue now, for all the MCU films, and if I had young children I'm not sure I would feel at all good about letting them see them. And the fact that this issue is lampooned in ""Age of Ultron"" makes the problem all the more real.

All that said....this movie was better than ""Iron Man 3"". And better than DC's ""Man of Steel"". Probably not as good as ""Green Lantern"", though (a brilliant comic book movie that was largely rejected by the general population). I'm giving it 6/10 stars simply because the ending of the film caused it to not fall flat on its face, but this movie certainly represents a devolution for MCU properties--which is truly sad considering that this was Marvel's flagship franchise around which everything else is supposed to be built.",6

By far the best Marvel movie ever!!!,25 April 2015,,7
Another Over the Top Marvel Movie,11 May 2015,"Avengers Age of Ultron has too many characters, too many enemies, too many twists, and too many sub plots. A lot of the times, I felt that it was too rushed and too difficult to follow the direction of the movie. I felt the introduction of Scarlett Witch (Elizabeth Olson) and Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) was unnecessary, as they weren't important to the plot most of the time. It also doesn't help that they both sport very annoying and unconvincing Eastern European accents. I felt Ultron (James Spader) played his role very well, but was a weak villain overall. I felt that the AI gone rogue plot to destroy the world was way too cliché. There were some good moments in the movie, and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), and Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) get a chance to shine where they previously didn't in Avengers 1. There are a lot of funny moments, and the best parts of the movie are where they interact and bounce off each other, and trade puns. In the end, this movie just feels frantic and hysterical and half- baked Marvel movie, lacking the quality of Captain America 2 and the fun factor of Guardians of the Galaxy, making the movie fall short of my expectations.",8

In Burtons 1989 Batman, you had this great movie and tribute to the superhero, then by the time Batman and Robin came around it all got to be quite silly. This movie is the Batman and Robin of the Avengers series. To many characters, not enough plot, way to much action(without purpose), not enough character development to understand the motivations behind why their doing what they do. This is just another expensive and empty special effects mega movie, that is going to make money, but not going to make much else happen. I really was hoping for so much more, but it is what it is, in the end.",5
Avengers 2 is Awesome,29 November 2016,"Avengers: Age of Ultron.

I really enjoyed this movie. It had a lot of action. I loved Robert Downy, Jr. in this movie as Iron Man. List of Positives: Terrific acting all around. Great Special Effects. Good amount of humor. Scary bad guy. This movie was not as slow paced as the first. I loved every minute of it. Negatives: None. This movie was near perfect. I can't really complain about it. This is what expect from Summer Movie entertainment. Go see this movie now. It is worth buying from the store. If you like action movies, then this was the best action movie of 2015.

Overall, this was a really cool movie. Can't wait for part 3!",

Avengers Re-Assemble,24 April 2015,"I saw this movie earlier today as it was released earlier than the US for where I live, and I found myself having a great time at the movies. This sequel brings back the members from the first Avengers film as well as a few new members such as Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch. Though I enjoyed this movie a lot, I found it to be quite flawed. My biggest complaint being that the movie was way too rushed and didn't give enough effort to be as great as they could have been. The action however, is superb as always and makes up for it. I still enjoyed this film a lot, but it could have been better.

My Rating: 8.5 out of 10",10
An Improvement Over the First Avengers,12 January 2016,"I didn't have any expectations going into this movie. I haven't been particularly fond of Marvel movies since 'The Wolverine' came out, so what drove me to watch this most is unknown to me. As expected, it wasn't anything special.

Avengers: Age of Ultron's plot isn't something we haven't all seen before. Technology takes over the world, and now the superheroes have to stop it. That's not entirely accurate, but for the most part that's what it is. Now it's not bad for a movie to have an unoriginal plot, and in this case it was alright. Some of the ideas surrounding the new-found technology were interesting. Unfortunately the movie was so focused on action that it forgot to develop the plot further then it's base idea, which was a little disappointing.

The characters are, once again, nothing special. Their personalities revolve almost solely on their sense of humor, which for everyone is pretty much the exact same. So all the jokes are at least in character (for the most part) but they rarely go deeper than that.

Something that really bothered me was Quiksilver and Scarlet Witch. There were two things about them: 1: Neither of their names are ever said. The only reason why I knew who Quiksilver was was because he ran quickly, and the 'Quik' part of his nickname is obviously referring to the word 'quick'. Scarlet Witch, however, was never mentioned by name. At least not to my memory. They were never really introduced, just thrown in. 2: Like I just said, they were just thrown in. Whatever their role was with the baddies was never very well developed, and they just came and went as they pleased. They never felt like real characters and more just as existences that you knew were there but didn't really even want to be. They were just a waste of space, and the movie would have been almost identical without them.

The action is more entertaining than it was in the first movie, which is good, considering that's all that these movies revolve around anyways. It's certainly far from the best action I've ever seen, but it made it a least a little better.

Overall Avengers: Age of Ultron is just okay. Some forced or weak characters, along with a cool but poorly developed plot and decent action make it at least entertaining. Unfortunately, it's far from great, or even good. If you've already lost hope in Marvel then don't bother with this one, it (probably) won't restore your faith in them. In the end I wouldn't recommend this movie unless you were a die- hard, easily impressed Marvel fanboy (or fangirl).",6
"A good movie, first was better",3 May 2015,"The first Avengers was excellent, my favorite comic book movie. It seemed after Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Guardians of the Galaxy, and Daredevil that Marvel was unstoppable.

The facts are Age of Ultron is not as good as these three. It is much better than most summer movies though, and if it didn't have these three in it's recent canon, nor the amazing first movie, I think this one wouldn't be getting so much criticism. The danger of consistent excellence is flaws and shortcomings tend to get magnified.

So, let's be clear: this a good movie. Pretty well balanced with action and comedy (although it does have a LOT of one-line quips, most work though), a few characters get fleshed out nicely (Hawkeye, Black Widow, and The Vision have some of the best character development, others not so much), a fine villain (but with a with a rushed origin story), and pretty decent juggling of a very crowded roster. So kudos, many great things to see and enjoy.

Where it's getting so much heat is that people wanted it to be the best comic movie of all time, to be better than the Avengers and Winter Soldier and The Dark Knight. But it isn't, it's a good movie in a strong cinematic universe. As second movies go it's more Temple of Doom than Empire Strikes Back: it will stand proudly on the shelf but nerds will argue whether the first or third was the best.

Frankly though, I wasn't disappointed at all, in fact I enjoyed every minute of it. It didn't have to be better than those others to be very good, and it is. I just wanted it to be more, but I'm happy with what it is.

Ignore the extremists on both sides, this is neither ""amazing"" nor ""bust"" material. Come watch a really good film in a film series that's providing some great entertainment. I'll be very excited for the further films, to me this really sets the stage nicely for Civil War and Infinity War.",8
A Visual feast-nothing more,4 May 2015,"All those here who are bothering to examine every detail of this film are really wasting their time. It's perfectly clear by now that these Super-hero films are just a visual feast which provide entertainment for a couple of hours and then are soon forgotten. The cinematic equivalent of junk-food. The CGI in this film is breath-taking, the fight scenes go on endlessly and it all sweeps along at a (mostly) frantic pace. That's all there is to it. The plot has so many holes that several sky-carriers could fit through, the actors know they are NOT performing Shakespeare, and the producers are too busy counting the money that's coming in to bother anyway. And there you go. Those who love this kind of thing will probably be happy-those that hate it will hate this too. To properly enjoy it you must dis-engage your brain and let it wash over you. And that's exactly what it does.

Just as a comparison-in the 1950s audiences flocked to see pulp sci-fi flicks, such as ""Them!""(about giant spiders), ""The Blob"" (about a giant blob!) and many others. They were a distraction, to take people's minds off the serious things that were happening in the world. And they were meant to be viewed on that level. There were, admittedly, a few gems along the way, such as, ""The day the earth stood still"", ""War of the worlds"", ""Forbidden Planet"" and ""invasion of the body-snatchers"". These films had a fair amount of intelligence to them-but they were more the exception really. It was just about entertainment. Today's equivalent are these Superhero films. Anyone watching them knows exactly what to expect, or should do by now considering there have been 3 Iron Man films, 2 Thor and 2 Captain America films. This film is hardly going to deviate from those by being an intimate study in human relationships! No -it's big, loud and meant to be viewed in good weather! So enjoy it for what it is, just don't expect anything more. For those that do then this film is really not for you and you should go and watch something else.",6

"bites off a bit more than it can chew, but still delivers",3 May 2015,"With S.H.I.E.L.D. dismantled and ominous threats still looming worldwide, the Avengers are left to their own devices as they try and maintain their status as Earth's mightiest heroes. Seeking a way to preserve global peace after their latest mission to retrieve the Scepter turns out to be especially demanding, team benefactor Tony Stark (now more the mad scientist than the billionaire genius), unveils the ""Ultron project"" an artificial intelligence program that promptly evolves into a powerful sentient incapable of distinguishing between saving humanity, or simply eradicating it. Encountering new foes, familiar faces, and unexpected obstacles, time is not on their side as the team attempts to complete their mission. Never quite as epic in scale as it predecessor this often feels more like a transition or prelude to the next phase of the MCU, but it still serves up some sensational action sequences and stunts, memorable fight scenes, excellent visual effects, well-written dialogue, and an incomparable cast. Not particularly deep, as evidenced by its underdeveloped supporting characters and subplots, but it's still a lot of fun and most importantly leaves you wanting more. ***",
"Definitely a treat for a Superhero fan but for other people, it depends upon their Self Acceptance",26 April 2015,"Marvel had set the foot in reuniting their comic hit lists in the sequel for The Avengers which is said to entitled as Avengers: Age of Ultron. After the Directer Joss Whedon mentioned about the sequel, it actually peers that the expectations among people really went viral. Guess what people, he does that yet another time. The sequel was absolutely better than the previous screening. The thing which really matters for a superhero movie is majorly the plot and the Technical portions that too the realistic effects which was brought about by the VFX Team ( Visual Effects). It seems to be like the Green mat technology that is the Chroma Key method which really did work for this kind of film.

And about the casts, whom do we must consider as the Theme for the whole creation. To begin with about the step ahead theme was the introduction of The Twins performed by Aaron Taylor- Johnson as Quicksilver and Elizabeth Olsen as Scarlet Witch. They added the true miracle to the film. As usual Robert Downey Jr. personified the casual appearance in this film along with the herculean Hulk, the respected Captain America, the tall dude Thor, the beautiful Nat and Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye. They added the enthusiastic effect not only to the film but also to the people who are watching it. Even though Samuel L. Jackson appeared only in some few portion, the Pulp Fiction Star added the awesomeness in this film. His dialogues are needed to be highlighted and he is truly damn good in delivering it. Along with many others, overall they added the Bonding Power to this film.

About the Technicians, Cinematography by Ben Davis. The Cinematography seems to be one of the toughest parts next to the plot creation and the VFX portion. Fixing a particular frame under the green mat technology is highly difficult but under these circumstances, the cinematographer had really proved his brilliancy with his Camera. Music by Brian Tyler and Danny Elfman. Actually to be truthful, it was a way too disappointed with the Background scores. It was better for a Superhero film but not seems to be impressive enough. Editing by Jeffrey Ford and Lisa Lassek, it was spiced over the film perfectly and the editors did a splendid job. At last the Visual effects Team, they had really done an outstanding job in turning the impossible tasks possible. Overall they are the Real Heroes whom will be happy to celebrate the Victory of Avengers: Age of Ultron. About the Screenplay. The second half was more energetic than the first half with Spectacular Interval block. Along with his hard work, the director has to thank his team for lifting him up for displaying their best.

Finally for the Negative side. People who hate to watch a superhero film will definitely feel like hating it. Especially Christopher Nolan's Batman admirers, Avengers: Age of Ultron will never be a kind of a film what they expect. You people got to digest it and set yourself to watch such Summer Entertainer.",7
Experience was similar to first one,28 April 2015,"I found the first Avengers movie a mash up of too many characters and stories and I was overwhelmed till the end of the movie. In the end when everything fell in its place the movie felt good.

Age of Ultron is also something similar, more characters then last movie, more complex interconnected stories this time, Josh Weadon has managed it beautifully, but I find it extremely difficult to like it as soon as I have seen it and I have seen it yesterday.

Just like last move it grows on you, more I think about it more I like it. Anyways there is a build up for Infinity and Civil war, so more great things yet to come. Always a great pleasure to watch the biggest movie of the year.",8
"A must watch, at least once.",27 April 2015,"Despite many number of trailers, rumors etc, this movie offers much more than what was its trailers. From minute one the movie engages you. Action lovers won't be disappointed even a little bit and the movie stays thick in its action as well as dialogues.

The characters portrayed are great, especially Robert Downey Jr., but the best scenes of the movie belong to Hulk. Scenes between Captian America, Ironman and Thor are great with perfectly timed dialogues, while teamwork between Thor and Captian America works well.

Hawkeye and Black Widow do their job well, with Hawkeye surprising you a little bit. Introduction of new characters will make you excited at first, but then you'll feel they lack true purpose of what they have to do with two of them shown like kids, and one coming at the end.

Ultron is good as villain, but he brings nothing new to the plot.

The plot will sound similar, but the graphics and portrayal of it is much better. Tech geeks will love it for sure, even those who don't favor too much computing will also like it. The first half drags a little, while the second half has many surprises.

Addition of romance in between might be rather awkward in this action flick, but towards the end you will be surprised for sure. Talking about the end, you will have mixed emotions and will definitely debate on whether you liked the first part or not.

Final Verdict: Funny scenes are really funny, action scenes are really the best, but at the end some of you may feel this might just be a one time watch. But do watch it at least once, not for the story but for the action.",7
Pretty Good,1 May 2015,"I liked it.

My favorite part is James Spader as Ultron.

Didn't think we'd see Spader at all but the way they do Ultron shows how closely they studied Spaders facial movements and ""ticks"" like when he licks his lips and how he tilts his head. Well done.

His voice is so great, deep, menacing.

I don't feel it was slow, kept my attention all the way through.

Quite a few laughs. Only problem I had with it was scenes of destruction moved almost too fast.

It sets up the rest of the Marvel world to come.

I recommend this movie. Great Summer film experience.",8

Avengers 2 was great in some ways but a bust in others.,11 July 2015,,7
Filled with flaws and yet I still enjoyed the hell out of it.,3 May 2015,"""Everyone creates the thing they fear. Men of peace create engines of war. Avengers create invaders. Parents create children, that will supplant them.""

It's the kind of movie that I had great time with, even though I will agree to it having tons of flaws.

Lets start with the story, it was mostly a mess. Throughout the movie, it felt like so much stuff have been crammed into a runtime obviously not enough for it. Pacing was a hit and a miss. There were some stuff that was really rushed while other sequences dragged on. Ultron creation and character development in particular was rushed like hell, something that would have benefited greatly from getting more screen time. Also, whole thing between Bruce and Natasha felt forced and out of place. Their scenes really dragged on. It would have been better if they went with Natasha and Steve instead as they had great chemistry in Winter Soldier. It just felt like the whole movie needed more time to be polished out, smooth out the rough edges.

While the story was a mess, the character set wasn't. The returning cast was great as usual, bringing their superhero A game. You could feel that they have been a team for a while now, having more chemistry with each other, cracking more jokes and poking more fun at each other etc. New additions, although a bit rushed, were pretty good. Vision, in particular, I felt was handled nicely. Scarlett Witch was hot (I love Elizabeth Olsen :p ) and Quicksilver always looked cool thanks to his power. Some great developments occurred character wise. Hawkeye finally had a notable presence, something that was dearly missing before.

Ultron was amazing. James Spader voice really made the character shine. I loved how he had more of a personality then being just a evil bad guy. He had so many great lines, often humorous. I was not actually expecting it as the trailers were really misleading, but it was welcomed nonetheless. Ultron stole every scene he was in but it's a shame he didn't had that much screen time in the movie. Also, he was nerfed like hell. Would have been cool if he actual put on a proper beating to the avengers, shook em bad and all, would have really improved the atmosphere of the movie.

Speaking of atmosphere, this is yet another movie falling victim to its misleading trailers. The trailers made me believe it would be a more serious sequel, but it wasn't. Hell, it had more humor than the first part. Joss whedon signature humor was sprinkled throughout the movie. And I actually enjoyed most of it as they had great timing and execution. Marvel movies have this thing being lite and enjoyable and I'm all with it. Many of it were the little things between the team that just made you like them more. But there were moments where toning down the humor would have been seriously great. The presence of Ultron that I wanted never reached that level as one liners and other laughs kept blocking it. That fear or hopelessness never arrived, and it was really disappointing.

Action though, was AMAZING. And there was lots of it. Well shot, directed and choreographed. It was handled much better this time as compared to the previous part. And the awaited Hulk vs HulkBuster fight was a feast for the eyes. So much epicness, such carnage and pure destruction. The fanboy in me was crazy happy. CGI was top notch, they spared no expense.

Soundtrack was good, although nothing special. Main theme of Avengers, which I love, was back, but was underutilized.

It is a given that there is no way to replicate that special and unique feeling of first part of having your favourite superheroes in one movie and acting as team. I found the first Avengers to be better overall. Despite its flaws though, I still found this movie to be a great one. I immensely enjoyed this film, had a great time at the theater and already are getting craving for a second viewing. If nothing else, it is still pretty entertaining. An extended cut with and alternate ending has been announced and it will be released with the BluRay. I believe it could solve many of the issues I have with this film. Can't wait to get my hands on the BluRay. If you're a Marvel fan, have been following the MCU movies and like this Universe, there is no doubt you will like/love this movie. Go watch it.

Technological terror hell-bent on human extinction. Along the way,24 April 2015,"The Avengers Age of Ultron

So clearly Avengers isn't extremely aiming for political here. plenty of rebirth — from metal to metal — happens at a church. As Nick Fury scoffs, the robots square measure ""breeding like Catholic rabbits"". Well, to place it gently, they are. Somehow, somewhere, within the thick of exploding cities, and therefore the same Sokovia ""where things square measure terribly bad"", robots with a assemblage of AI square measure springing out of assembly lines and jumping straight into war.

Age of Ultron Trailer

These robotic troops by ""Ultron"", cast from a mix of the other-wordy scepter and Stark's terribly own programme Jarvis (voiced by Paul Bettany). the things of sci-fi from yore involves pass once more once world messes with things it barely understands, significantly once that world essentially suggests that Tony Stark (Downey Jr). Ultron, whom he's hoping to make because the harbinger of peace, has his own ideas on however that peace is caused, resulting in world annihilation typically left to the forms of aliens.

Age of Ultron Deaths

There's no Norse deity here from the primary Avengers. however the team of Stark/Iron Man, Steve/Captain America (Evans), Bruce/The Hulk (Ruffalo), Natasha/Black Widow (Johansson), Thor (Hemsworth) and Barton/Hawkeye (Runner) have their hands full with Ultron (voiced by Spader) and a combine of ""Enhanced"" twins. The latter 2 have special powers which permit the boy (Taylor-Johnson) to maneuver like wind, and therefore the lady (Olsen) to govern minds. Avengers takes barely a disruption between its numerous supernatural clashes, together with a very long one between Iron Man and therefore the Hulk, and its collapsing buildings, vehicles, roads and tracks. So, whereas meaning any break is welcome, Whedon extremely adds zing once he will.However, at its heart, Whedon, UN agency co-wrote and directed Age of Ultron as he did the previous Avengers, is attempting too arduous and failing to create his film regarding the hazards in man taking part in god. nearly always, that story ends just one manner Age of Ultron Cancelled.",7
Good entertainment ...,25 April 2015,"I like the MCU and what they have achieved on the big and small screen and the latest installment is no exception. The movie is really entertaining, the special effects are top notch, the whole cast is great and besides good dialog and a bit of character development they also find plenty of time to throw out funny one-liners and slap stick in a non-contrived way. However, I was a bit disappointed with the polishing. It's still well rounded, but I left the theater feeling that it wasn't Whedon's best work and that he either kept too many reserves or ran out of them all together. The sub-plots are usually way better embedded in the main story and even if it's an action flick his emotional scenes carry a bit of a bunch. He still tried to do it, but in this area the movie falls short and some of the scenes even feel unnecessary. The characters where still great though, Ultron and the Avengers aren't just black and white but feature a few shades of gray. Still, as I said, good entertainment and a fun movie.",8
"A spectacle of visual action, with surprising character developments",1 May 2015,"Unlike 90% of the US population, I did not expect much from this movie at all. Although I do like talking about comic books, I haven't seen many Marvel features (2, guardians and 1st avengers) before, and both of them did not entice me as much.

This film however was better than I thought it was going to be, I had heard people saying that it's going to be OK, so I just assumed that I was going to go be entertained for few scenes. I was wrong. I was entertained all the way. As with Avengers the action scenes in a large group flows together so well, and even with a larger cast in Avengers 2, the massive cast creates more harmony rather than chaos. There were some times, like hulk buster vs hulk, where the action was too close for my taste but it still worked for what it was trying to achieve.

Avenger 2 not only excels in the action scene, but does well in both the comedic and dramatic moment. While some action movies have dramatic scenes that are too boring or overly cliché, Avengers 2 has a nice dramatic scenes that does not go for the overly serious tone, but uses it to further it's character development as well as team development. Also the comedy works well, there are lot of comic reliefs between big action scenes but also during action scenes as well. The nice moment provides a break for the audience as well as provide few chuckles along the way.

The problem that I had with this movie is mostly on advertising, Beats by Dre, Gillette, Samsung, even though I know that most movie does that, the blatant use of advertising just took me out of the movie. That's just my pet peeve, but another problem that it had was that often it felt like it was a repetition of Avengers. While the middle part in the story has more background and character development that were not primarily featured on Avengers, the battle of wits and the last battle felt like they sort of overused the plot again. Those are my only problems though. The movie is a great entertainment for everybody, it's something that you should see it on the big screen, definitely worth the ticket price.",6
Well worth a trip to the cinema,23 April 2015,"I saw the movie today and was blown away! Having really enjoyed the first movie I was sceptical that a sequel would be as good or better (as we well know, sequels are rarely better than the original) however, this sequel is marginally better in my opinion. The opening scene sets the tone and it doesn't slow down from there. This movie has had great writing, a brilliant cast - superb almost flawless CGI which will leave you speechless and the storyline is excellent, but you will need to concentrate as it gets alittle complicated at times (as expected). We get to see a more human side of the characters in this movie and there is a very funny cameo from the legend Stan Lee. We also get to see plenty of Hulk scenes which were fantastic. By the time this movie finished it left me wanting more! oh, and whatever you do - do not walk out of the cinema until you've seen the twist at the end - it kicks in about 3-4 minutes after the credits start up. It's well worth the short wait.",10
Amazing movie but not as good as first!,7 July 2015,,7
"Below expectations, but still good.",26 April 2015,"I was expecting a lot. The trailers were really exciting and I indeed did enjoy The Avengers part 1 .

Well the clear difference why this movie cannot be compared with movies like The dark knight Trilogy,it lacks proper story and content. And last but not the least , a good villain.IN all the movies of Batman, the villain is strong and cunning, which makes the movie exciting and gives additional respect to the Protagonist of the movie.But this movie lacks it all.IN 'The Avenger' Loki was a complete idiot, making pun of himself.I expected Ultron to be stronger and more serious.But what is he like? Completely opposite of what is shown in the trailer.He cracks jokes and is over confident of himself.And above all, he is weak. Iron man alone defeats him, Captain America beats him black and blue! This was not expected at all. But this the movie does not fail to deliver,the action sequences and entertaining and equally enjoyable; especially Hulk vs HulkBuster. The 3D effects are indeed special.But again, the movie entirely relies on special effects, no proper content.The movie had potential to be great, just by making Ultron stronger,fortifying the army of Ultron( the robots were very weak and feeble) and making the movie a bit darker. On the concluding note, Its a highly entertaining popcorn flick!",8
Entertaining But Pretty Much The Same As The First.,14 May 2015,,6
"Amazing, amazing and amazing.",24 April 2015,"This is the best movie in the MCU. Every second of the movie was full of action, full of excitement. The post-credit scene was also amazing. Tony Stark being Tony Stark. Banner and Romanoff falling in love. Thor returning to his home, The sacrifice of Pietro was a piece of teamwork, showing that Avengers live and die together. Joss Whedon did an amazing job, so did the crew. Can't wait for Phase 3 to start. It will be amazing. I hope that phase 3 will be the last because 3 is should be enough for Marvel. I hope that Joss Whedon stays. He always knows how to work with those stars. It was worth giving 15. Americans will love this movie. It's going to make a lot of money. And it will deserve it. James Spader did an amazing job by voicing the bad guy. It sounded very epic.",10
Not as good as the first,25 April 2015,,7
The most anticipated film of 2015 but just a big disappointment,2 May 2015,"I have been wanting to see this film since July 2014 when they announced the name, but I was just disappointment when the credits rolled. It had so much potential that was just thrown away by $250 million. The film begins with a full Avengers action scene, but the action falls short of the standard that you would see from other Marvel films like Iron Man or Avengers Assemble, it's just a bit all over the place. The story also follows suit, the story twists and developed characters that you see in DC films are gold dust compared to the development of characters and story in this. But it does have it's up sides, there are quite a few good jokes that'll keep you happy and good CGI for some eye candy.",5
AVENGERS ULTRON: Season Crossover Finale,7 June 2015,,
Awesome but kinda Disappointing *Spoiler free review*,27 April 2015,"First of all, I am not a Marvel/DC fan-boy. I watch films of both MCU and DC movies. So lets get to the review. This will be a spoiler free review.

The movie has action right from the beginning, but those scenes are NOT at all memorable compared to Avengers 1 or Winter Soldier. For the first time(or maybe I am wrong), I have seen a Marvel movie not show some of the action scenes properly and was kinda blurry whenever there was an Iron man vs. Ultron fight.

Unlike Avengers 1, there are some really good emotional scenes in this movie for each and every Avenger. But I was really disappointed with the screen time Ironman/RDjr got in this movie. All he did was create ultron and later HM something similar to that.

Plot is good(for an Avengers movie), but the execution was not proper. I really don't blame Joss Whedon(He's a brilliant director) for it as he had too much pressure to outdo the first one and as we all know, it would have been difficult for any director to outdo his own masterpiece.

Highlight of the movie is easily the Hulk vs. Hulkbuster scene. It surpassed my expectations and was really entertaining. That will compensate for the other *bad* action scenes(There are some REALLY bad action scenes in this movie).

Now lets get to the new characters/Avengers and the Antagonist- Ultron. Personally, I liked Ultron. But he was way underused. His plans are clichéd and are there just for the sake of the movie. But that doesn't mean he was not a good antagonist. Just saying that he could have been better. Scarlett Witch and Quicksilver were good, but their superpowers were not explained properly(Especially Scarlett witch). But they were really good. *BUT* the movie would have been the SAME without their involvement and they had nothing much to do except for the first few scenes and the final battle of course. Final battle could have been worse but a special character saved it and I am sure each and every one of you will love that character.

Action: 8/10 A superhero movie must have some good action scenes and this movie delivers. Hulk vs. Hulkbuster scene steals the show, as expected. But the final battle is very similar to that of A1 and it is exhausting to see the SAME thing happening again and again. I really was hoping that it'll be a 10/10 when it came to Action sequences.

Plot: 7/10 Clichéd and very similar to the first Avengers movie. But, it was really entertaining and the concept of AI was good enough. So, I will give it a 7/10.

Characters: 9.5/10 This was the best part of this movie. The already familiar Avengers like Thor, Hawkeye, Cap and Black widow are well written in this movie. But the only complaint is that Iron man did not have enough screen-time. Ultron was good, Scarlett Witch and Quicksilver were better than expected.

Ending(Special mention): 10/10 Was quite emotional. Deserves the mention.

Overall: Trying to outdo Avengers, which was easily one of the best Superhero movies, led this movie into a somewhat clichéd attempt. But it delivered what was expected. Don't expect TOO much or disappointment is guaranteed. Just sit back and Enjoy. 7.5/10",6
The haters are wrong. Avengers: Age Of Ultron is another fantastic Marvel film.,7 May 2015,"When I was in a movie theater waiting for Avengers: Age Of Ultron to begin playing, I had low expectations for the film. I've read the reviews online, and many people were saying that Age Of Ultron is dumb, boring and overstuffed with mindless action. In other words, they were saying that this is Marvel's first turkey. So there I was sitting and expecting the worst. After what seemed like half an hour of commercials and trailers, the film began with thrilling action, with the Avengers on a mission. During the fighting new characters were introduced and their powers were demonstrated. This set up everything that followed. I definitely enjoyed the opening act. But wait, some reviewers mentioned that there's a dull middle section after the thrilling opening. So I kept on waiting for the film to get stuck in the mud. An hour passed and Age Of Ultron continued to entertain. In fact, even though the film is over 2 hours long, the time just flies by. After an hour passed I began to realize that the reviewers were wrong or that they were judging the film harshly. I'm pleased to say that Age Of Ultron is another success for Marvel Studios. Actually, I wasn't even thinking about this much because the film kept my attention until the very end. Sure, it's a Hollywood product, but it's a Hollywood product written and directed by Joss Whedon. So Whedon once again delivered what he should have delivered - a real superhero movie. People seem to forget that Age Of Ultron is a superhero movie. It's not The Godfather (1972). It's not Chinatown (1974). And it's not serious science-fiction like Solaris (1972). It's a film based on comic book material. And it delivers what it should - action, comedy, special-effects, fantastic characters and a world under threat. By the way, Whedon delivered all this with intelligence and style. The Avengers - Iron Man, Thor, Hulk, Captain America, Black Widow, Hawkeye - are as good as ever. Their interactions are witty, fun and dramatic when needed. The new characters - Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch - are welcome additions. They're played well by Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen. But there's also Vision (Paul Bettany), whose role in the film is almost as important as that of the villain Ultron (James Spader). So I've got to say that this film really surprised me. It's even more entertaining than The Avengers (2012). It may not be better than the first Avengers film, but it's another solid entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. After the impressive Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014) I was a bit disappointed by Guardians Of The Galaxy (2014). After watching Age Of Ultron I had the same feeling that I got after watching The Winter Soldier - that things can only go up from here. I definitely recommend Age Of Ultron, and I can't wait to see it again myself. The battle at the end was amazing too by the way.",8
Action for the sake of action,4 May 2015,"Have you ever gone to a movie and realized that what was on the screen was a literal depiction of a bunch of writer's brainstorming session? That is what this felt like. It probably started out with a concept and someone yells out, ""Yeah, and then we can have Hulk run out and destroy a building!"" Then the next guys says, ""Then Captain America fights 7 guys and beats them by ..."". ""Yeah, cool. And then Tony Stark pulls out a secret weapon that will ...."" You get it. It seemed like plot line by committee. Maybe it was a great movie that an editor didn't piece together properly because it was out there. Additionally, the plot holes were too much, even for a Marvel Comic.

I am a movie fan. I watch for entertainment and don't rip apart a good movie because of production values or one character's bad acting. I can get through it for what it is worth. I never talk in a movie either. But in this one I found myself leaning over to my friend with a lot of ""Whaaaaat?"" Don't do another Avengers, please.",6
"A Fun, Entertaining Ride!",30 April 2015,"""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" is the 11th film entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, that began with ""Iron Man"" in 2008. Joss Whedon who wrote and directed the first team up movie of the MCU - ""The Avengers"" in 2012, returned to do the same for the sequel, and as confirmed by all, barring a changing of minds, or a surprise return down the line. will be his swan song for Marvel. ""The Avengers"" is generally considered one of the best, if not the Best Superhero film of all time. The first trailer for the sequel suggested a much darker tone, while the trailers that followed showed the trademark Whedon humor he injected into the first one – indicative of his past work, ala his TV series - ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"", ""Angel"", etc., would be there as well. While there is some dark tone to it, with some great moments when it goes in that direction, ultimately most of great parts of the movie for me were the great humorous one-liners, spread out practically amongst all the main players, and one or two non main players. Returning Avengers are Tony Stark – Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Captain America - Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), Thor (Chris Hemsworth) , The Hulk – Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo), Black Widow – Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansen) and Hawkeye – Clint Barton (Jeremy Renner). A number of their supporting players from other MCU movie figure prominently as well, and they are also joined by new comers – The Maximoff Twins – Pietor – Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor- Johnson), and Wanda – Scarlett Witch (Elizabeth Olsen), as wel1 as the Vision (Paul Bettany). The antagonist is the Robot ""Ultron"" (voiced by James Spader - Yes – The voice of Tony Stark's computer Jarvis – When you the see movie – all will be clear). In as nut shell – the movie is a mostly fun and entertaining for the around 2 ½ hour running time. It is well paced, so it never feels long. All the characters are given moments, and different story arcs are touched upon with each of them. Sometimes that does create a jumble, and if some were fleshed out more, while it would have sacrificed time for some of the other story arcs, I think it would have improved the movie. Having said that – In the end, while not as good as the original, it is an enjoyable, fun ride, and Whedon's great Dialogue, humorous and non-humorous, when it does hit, and it hits often - shines! 3 ¼ out of 4 Stars - 8 ½ out of 10 Stars.",8
Disappointing,25 April 2015,,6
"Vastly entertaining and brilliantly witty, but definitely overstuffed- ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" is a good sequel that just can't QUITE reach the greatness of its predecessor.",29 April 2015,"If there's one thing to take from the current slew of user- reviews, it's this... when hype's involved, people grow fanatic and lose any sense of objectivity. And they will say anything less than perfection ""sucks."" This is definitely not an overly-disappointing film, nor by any stretch of the imagination are the plethora of 1-out-of-10 scores reflective of the film. I would strongly advise everyone to see the film and judge it by its own merits, and not by the knee-jerk ""it's not 'Gone with the Wind', therefore it deserves a 1!"" reviews polluting this site. (Not only for this film, but virtually all new releases.)

I happily managed to see an advance screening of ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"", and there was one main thought that floated adrift in my mind the entire runtime... ""I really like this! This is a ton of fun! ...but it's not QUITE as much fun as the first time around.""

And that really sums up ""Age of Ultron""- vastly entertaining and brilliantly witty. Very decently-written and wonderfully directed. And most definitely deserving of the big- screen experience. But never quite able to live up to the promise and the high bar set by the original. This is merely a ""good"" sequel. Not a ""great"" one.

The Avengers must deal with a new threat with the rise of Ultron- an artificial intelligence birthed through the power of Loki's lost scepter merged with Stark Industry Drone tech. Taking in the entirety of human history at once through his connection to world communications, Ultron almost immediately rebels, seeing humanity's flaws as a sign that the world as-is must end. Together with the twin test-subjects Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch, Ultron devises a deadly scheme to become a more ""perfect"" being, all while creating a plot that could lead to human extinction. And so, Earth's mightiest heroes must band together to stop him, no matter what the cost may be.

Joss Whedon has really pushed the limit when it comes to storytelling within the MCU with this film, both for better and for worse. You can tell he's having a blast, and his writing reflects this. When it's at its best, this film often matches and even exceeds the high-bar set by Whedon's own original. The banter of the Avengers, and even the villain Ultron, is fantastic, and Whedon has a way with developing the story and characters in a fun, stylistic-yet-organic way that raises the stakes constantly and leaves you in awe of the spectacle. However, the problem with this is that his script sometimes goes too far, and tries to put too many ideas into play at once, leading to a frankly muddled and poorly-paced first act. In fact, so muddled and poorly-paced, the film almost lost me. And in a weird way, I think Whedon's experiences with television were a part of my issues- the film feels a little too ""episodic"" up front as well, which threw me off. Thankfully, the problems with the pacing ended by the 45-minute mark, and the ensuing 60+ minutes of screen time were pure geeky joy.

The acting is all around fantastic. There's no need to really comment on the returning cast (including Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlet Johannsen, Mark Ruffalo, Jeremy Renner, Don Cheadle and Samuel L. Jackson, among others), as they are all so in-tune with their characters, they come off flawless as ever. Although I appreciated that more focus was given to the ""secondary"" players like Renner's Hawkeye, rather than just having it be the ""Iron Man and friends"" show as I had feared. Everyone is given equal screen time and all shine.

The new cast-members are generally wonderful. Particularly James Spader's Ultron- a bizarrely contradictory character who is both demented prophet and rebellious child. It's really fun seeing Ultron- who let's face it, is basically a newborn accustomed to throwing tantrums and suffering great delusions of grandeur, as he develops over the course of the film. Elizabeth Olsen and Aaron Taylor-Johnson are also fairly compelling in their roles as the Maximoff twins, though I will say I feel Olsen often outshined Taylor-Johnson as the beautiful and tormented Scarlet Witch. I think the big problem is that only a year ago, we saw Taylor-Johnson's Quicksilver portrayed, frankly with much more gusto and originality in the film ""X-Men: Days of Future Past."" (Though the films aren't connected- they merely both have their own versions of the same character.)

The effects and action are absolutely top-notch. And they more than make up for some of my other grievances. From a wonderful opening single-shot action sequence, to the mythical ""Hulkbuster"" fight to the long and intense climax- this film is definitely one to give you constant thrills. Some may feel the film suffers from action- overload, and I will admit, there was one fight-scene that felt a little contrived, but they're just so much fun and so well-structured (as they make good use of the actual CHARACTERS and show their emotional states throughout), I didn't mind.

The rest of the production is fantastic. Especially the musical score courtesy of Danny Elfman and Brian Taylor. Great soundtrack than not only includes new themes, but also includes enough callbacks to Alan Silvestri's magnificent score from the original to keep a sense of audible continuity between the two films. (Call me a geek, but I prefer it when films in a series have recurring themes... something not many sequels these days do.)

Overall, I was very satisfied with ""Age of Ultron"", while still being able to admit it's flawed. Sure, the first 45 minutes had a lot of issues, and the film moves a bit too fast and clunky... but I was having too much fun to care!

I give it a solid 7.5 out of 10. Assemble in line at the cinema and see it for great thrills and great laughs!",8
Not as great as its predecessor,24 April 2015,"I have been waiting since last summer for an movie which can be satisfactory. But after watching AOU, the wait continues. This movie has humor. The action sequences in the first half satisfies an adrenaline junkie but the climax fight is a huge letdown. The romantic angle seems forced. Overall a disappointing affair. You should watch it once for the epic battle between IRON MAN and the HULK. Captain America had a decent role while hawkeye's character gets explored. Thor seems to have developed humor which is enjoyable. Director Joss Whedon seems to have not developed the climax. A pretty engaging first half. Slow in the middle. Picks up towards the big end and falters at the big end.",6

"with that budget, could have been much better.",24 April 2015,,7
"Darker, Smarter, Better!",25 April 2015,"Age of Ultron is a spectacular Marvel instalment to end phase 2 of the ongoing superhero project.

All the familiar faces we've seen so far reprise their roles as lovable misfits who come together to put an end to HYDRA. Everything that the first Avengers movie had is doubled in this one. There is the oh so familiar clever wit which we have come to recognise within these films, tons of great action scenes where every Avenger gets their moment in the spotlight, and a new nemesis in Ultron who proves to be a formidable opponent, and the toughest the team have faced so far!

James Spader provides an intense and intimidating voice for our 8 foot iron giant, ultron, whose presence throughout the entire film is exciting to say the least. The other editions include the Maximoff twins who add great visual powers. In the previous films they relied on punches and energy blasts whereas with the twins we are introduced to new powers we haven't yet seen. Its fresh and adds a new dimension to the story and the universe.

One thing i particularly enjoyed (without giving away too much) was the development of Hawkeye. We see a lot more of him and his background in this movie as opposed to the first Avengers movie, and of course the 5 minute cameo spell he had in Thor.

I constantly felt excited and intrigued watching this movie as there was never a dull moment. It really is an epic, full on spectacle. Another aspect i enjoyed is that although Stark is the centre of the creation of Ulton, the story never solely focused on him as the first Avengers tended to slightly. The time on screen for each character felt even, although i do wish we saw a bit more of Thor who didn't seem to have as much dialogue even though he was present for the most part.

Overall, this is a fantastic film which sits comfortably in the top 3 Marvel films to date.",8
"Overstuffed, undercooked, disjointed but enjoyable",6 June 2015,"Where to begin? It really is a massive credit to Joss Whedon that this isn't a complete disaster. There have been reports that give the impression that the film nearly killed him and I can bloody well shows!

If the gigantic cast of characters and plethora of plot lines didn't break his creative back then it definitely herniated a few discs and strained a few muscles. There are SO many characters and SO much going on that the movie felt like a massive traffic jam that had to be navigated on the way to Phase Three of the MCU.

You can feel that Whedon on many occasions tried make it as personal a film for him as he possibly could. However, You can also sense the despondent torment he must have felt throughout the movie. On more than one occasion, it was noticeable that a scene or a sequence was written at a point of pure creative and artistic hopelessness. That's scary! Whedon deserves to take a very long vacation and then make a very self-indulgent low-budget art-house film after this.

With so much going on and so many character to keep track of doesn't come without its drags. It's a film that ultimately comes out as overstuffed and a tad undercooked. It was entertaining nevertheless. The bright spots from the first Avengers movie are all there with a whole new, darker more sinister escapade in tow. James Spader's Ultron came off as a bit of a naff and cartoony antagonist compared to Hiddleston's Loki in the previous instalment. The surface level philosophising is fairly obligatory and mirrors the same level of politicising that was in Captain America: The Winter Soldier.

AOU could have done with an extra half an hour on to its running time with a few scenes altered slightly to make it a more satisfying experience on the whole. I didn't feel any particular plot line of the many that were included came off with as much grace or ease as they could have. Overall, a rollicking good time albeit a headache- inducing one.",6
I love this movie,15 August 2015,"Warning this review will contain spoilers.

The negativity is astounding this movie nailed it just like the first Avengers. We had great character stuff for Hawkeye, Black Widow, and Hulk. The dilemma Tony stark faces is a believable one and Downey Jr. nails it as always. All the actors had awesome performances.

The romance that develops between Black Widow and Bruce Banner is very nice, I thought it was very believable and I'm glad Wheadon decided to do it. Hawkeye having a family was a nice gift to the character and really helped his personality. Hawkeye manages to being even more badass then in the first Avengers.

The setup for future movies was handled well none of those plot points ever felt intrusive at all. I don't know why people say this plot is complicated I followed it pretty easily, Tony stark creates Ultron who goes rouge thinking humanity needs to be whiped out and the Avengers must stop him. It's implied Stark and Banner were working on Ultron for awhile from when they were talking before creating him.

All in all this movie was just as awesome as the last one and people need to stop having such high expectations or we may lose the MCU. I for one don't want that and I know many true fans who don't either.",10
Avengers: Age of clichè,24 April 2015,,7
Great fun!,26 April 2015,,9
A decent film that unfortunately grew tired towards the end,24 April 2015,"I went into the cinema with high expectations, and though I didn't walk out completely blown away, I wasn't completely disappointed by what I saw either, and if you are thinking about watching Avengers: Age of Ultron, then it is certainly worth a watch. For those dubious about how interesting or fresh a rogue AI out to destroy humanity (done countless times before) can be, the wheel has certainly been re-invented on this one.

The new additions to the Avengers cast are arguably the strongest. As expected, James Spader is stunning as Ultron, a very complex and charismatic character with a very generous dose of snarky humour that gives the Avengers' jokes and one-liners a run for their money. From Ultron's very first moments, we can already see hurt and a confusion completely atypical of the usual generic robotic villains that have been churned out of Hollywood in the past. And who isn't envious of the mesmerising (and completely natural) voice of James Spader? I could listen to him talk all day.

Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) were also strong additions. Quicksilver sparks life into some of the otherwise vacuous action scenes and The Scarlet Witch works her magic on the Avengers, pathing the way for some interesting scenes as her psychic powers are put into play.

Then we have our Avengers (Robert Downey Jr., Scarlet Johansson, Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo, Jeremy Renner) doing their usual Avengers stuff. Charming and humorous performances all round, and great chemistry together carried forward from the first film that plays out nicely and keeps the film engaging.

Age of Ultron also gives us plenty of food for thought, with there being plenty of moral questionability that sparks internal conflicts between our heroes. This leads to a more interesting and dynamic film much different from the typical superhero movies where all the in- between is just filler for the next explosive setpiece. Ironically, it is some of the action scenes that lack substance, not the rest, in which the character development and subplots were executed very well.

Indeed, the first two-thirds of the film were superb, however towards the end in what was supposed to be the climax, the film felt repetitive, predictable, boring. I mean, there are only so many ways Hawkeye can shoot arrows at robots, Captain America can throw his shield at robots, Hulk smashing robots to pieces - it only made what was probably supposed to be a breathtaking complex seem a bit tedious and agonising to watch, which was a real shame.

I've already heard claims that Age of Ultron is simply filler for the next phase Infinity War, however, I don't believe this is the case. Age of Ultron offers more dimensions than just a generic ""Superhero must stop Supervillain"" that is expected, though coming with the cost of some bland, repetitive action scenes. Credit to Avengers: Age of Ultron that this isn't your typical mindless shot of adrenaline here. Worth a watch.",7
Whedon does a wonderful job.,25 April 2015,"Review, Avengers: Age of Ultron.

The right lines at the right moment, the right action, the right VFX. Marvel does it time and again, the envelope of striking humour surrounding the plot though excessively at times but never ineffective.

Avengers isn't your average Marvel movie which you anticipate to be funny, light and entertaining. Yes, it didn't lose the humour, yes, Tony is still the guy. No doubt it's very true to the form but what makes this a remarkably different addition to the series is... well it's deep. It is highly character driven. A go through into each of the characters' lives, their complexities, their fears, sadness, each of which continually adds to your awe.

The common cast surely do a good job at doing what they do but there will be some character where most of your curiosity will deviate to and that's, you'll love to discover, is James Spades. Right from his dialogues to their deliverance, he shines excellently as the antagonist.

Moments exist where dialogues so good will charm your soul, moments exist where the action is so satisfying that you are shouting, applauding and probably craving for more of the like but at the same time there are moments which render you a underwhelming feel, moments which have no proper argument or explanation backing them up. Avengers Age of Ultron is not a flawless movie.

While being formulaic and having its fair share of flaws, its over the top action, the chemistry between the characters, the phenomenal screenplay and the skillfully employed and brilliantly voiced Ultron prove that Age of Ultron is a fantastic sequel. Its number of pluses outnumbering its flaws by large, Marvel takes a big step forward.

8.5/10. Amazing.",9
One of the Better MCU Movies out there!,2 May 2015,"In short, the long-awaited Avengers: Age of Ultron delivered us more or less the what we've come to expect from the MCU. Fantastic action pieces along with witty banter, to only be brought down by familiar villain characteristics. But that's not to say the movie was bad by any stretch, it was one hell of an entertaining ride and one of Marvel's best films to date. Everything from the first film was carried over and to new heights; action sequences, villain screen time, character banter, and expanded knowledge of the universe are all given more screen time. I can't see a sound reason die hard fans of the MCU would be disappointed here.

The only major problem with the movie is, of course, its villain Ultron. His powers, to no surprise, have been dulled down significantly and he is now a jokester of sorts. He wasn't nearly as menacing as the trailers made him out to be. At any given moment, he throws out a one liner for no real reason, so many in fact that it becomes near tiresome. But the core of the problem has to be Ultron's plans are nothing we haven't seen before. Another villain trying to end humanity as we know it and the Avengers are nipping at his heels the whole movie. They were actually too close to his heels the whole movie, in fact, they were prevailing for too much of the movie.

The only person to actually 'hurt' the Avengers was Scarlet Witch, and she switches sides, which leaves Ultron all alone. And by all alone I mean Vibranium Ultron and hundreds of easily disposable mini Ultrons. Only to be brought down in a predictable fashion and surprisingly easy fashion. It seems like the Marvel executives are saving the real destruction for future movies and Thanos, which makes these movies seem almost like place holders.

But on a high note, the movie is far more action-packed than its predecessor. Not only are the action scenes better than the first film, but we actually get to see the numerous powers from all of the superheroes. Scarlet Witch's telekinesis, The Vision's density manipulation, Thor's lightning possession, and, of course, a ton of smashing from the Hulk. It's hard to argue the movie isn't entertaining as hell! Is this the comic book movie to end all comic book movies? Not even close but it's still pretty damn awesome!",6
What the hell!,14 June 2015,,1
The Avengers want to kill Ultron to save the world,29 November 2015,"Everything about Avengers: Age of Ultron feels indulgent. Watching the film is like plugging through a TV box set in a single sitting. That's meant as a compliment, and if it sounds like a criticism, you're probably yet to experience the supreme contentedness that comes with bingen on five Game of Thrones episodes back-to-back.

Joss Whedon's film gives you that same pop-culture sugar rush, stacking characters, conflicts, subplots and background treats like tiers of wedding cake – far more than you'd think you could possibly cram into a little under two and a half hours without the whole thing crumbling under the weight of its own calorie count. But the structure holds, and the film flies past at speed. Among its other attributes, it's the first long blockbuster in years to feel short.

Avengers: Age of Ultron rounds off the second two-year phase of Marvel Studios' ongoing superhero serial, just as the fun but messier Avengers Assemble, also directed by Whedon, did the same thing for phase one in 2012.

It literally hits the ground running, with a three-minute, digitally crocheted tracking shot of the whole gang – Iron Man/Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Captain America (Chris Evans), The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) – hurtling through a frozen forest. Their destination is a Colditz-like castle where the terrorist group Hydra have in their clutches a crystal of (literally) Earth-shattering importance.",
Not a whole lot of fun.,27 September 2015,"The Avengers are somewhere batting some army in an awful intro scene filmed in cheap accelerated CGI. Later we learn they are attacking a Hydra facility to retrieve Loki's scepter and are after some German scientist. Of course none of them suffers a scratch that is until the German guy releases The Twins, a pair of ""enhanced"". One of them is a version of The Flash and the other a pretty girl who does Tai Chi and releases a powerful multipurpose red mist that controls people's minds, train brakes, and acts as a weapon and shield. These two finally manage to get at least the Arrow-copycat injured. But the operation is a success of course. The Arrow-copycat is healed in the regenerating machine borrowed from Elysium.

In Loki's scepter is artificial intelligence for some reason and Stark and Banner agree to merge it with Jarvis to unleash the Ultron initiative that will bring peace to earth through war and death. When Reddington-Ultron wakes up and wears one of Stark's suits he's a bit confused but ready to accomplish his mission so he goes rogue.

His first goal is to buy that super metal used to make CA's shield. By now he's joined forces with the twins. The Avengers crash the deal but Tai Chi girl makes them all hallucinate in long pointless sequences, that for some reason include a long and dull battle between the iron suit guy and the green guy and we learn which one is stronger.

Ultron borrows the healing machine that together with the supermetal will give him a super body but the downloading of all his consciousness is taking way too long in the superworld so the Avengers manage to grab the incipient being.

Stark and Banner again agree to do something stupid in the name of science, namely re-insert Jarvis' mind in the being and wake it but the others finally realize what these two morons are up to and put a stop to it. Until Thor arrives and jumpstarts the creature which happens to have a third eye made of one of the infinity stones.

By now Ultron without his superbody is ready to bring peace to earth, by helping humans evolve. His means of accomplishing this is for some reason wiping out all life on earth, so he separates a whole city from earth and once it's high enough he'll drop it on earth to act like a meteor.

Now all the dressed-up goofs will have to join forces and stop Ultron while saving everyone on the city that's starting to fly up.

Avengers: Age of Ultron is rather unimpressive. Nothing here stands out. There's no great action sequence to speak of, no central message. Instead this movie is, like Ultron, confused about what it stands for. The first half is somewhat anti-war, the second half adopts some bizarre message for kids about ""doing your job!"" (no matter what and without question, I take it). The message of unity and togetherness is lost in repeated exhortations to do your job.

Despite being penned and directed by Whedon himself, this movie is lacking both in action and dialogue. There's a lot of emotional stuff going on as with Romanoff's strange and surprising romance with Banner. At least it's handles with innocence. There are handful of smart and interesting lines but no worked out thoughts or ideas. Most come from Ultron as he analyzes human behavior, even though humans really shouldn't be that foreign to him. But the potential was there for more incisive thinking.

I didn't think much of the first Avengers movie and this one doesn't do much to change my mind about the multiple series of tiring sequels. Thor I and Captain America II remain so far the highlights. Unfortunately we're told that the Avengers will be back of course, perhaps next time they'll put more effort into making it a smart and entertaining movie.",6

"Avengers: Age of Ultron again brings our favorite heroes into action, even if the story is a little overstuffed",1 May 2015,"Though it's only the beginning of May, it's already feeling a lot like summer! Not because of the warm weather, kids being out of school or even the public pools already being filled up with families. Tis the season of the summer blockbuster! For the heavy film going audience, the year has two major seasons, the summer season, which is filled with the big, epic popcorn films that tend to be the most anticipated movies of the year, and the winter season, which is where all the award winners and performance features debut (if they haven't already at a film festival).

Though the blockbuster summer season started in the seventies, it has had the most change from the early nineties through the early 2000's. Super hero movies tended to be big draws, but they started to pick up further steam when Iron Man and The Incredible Hulk were released and no one could have anticipated the plans that Marvel had put into play. Captain America and Thor came along before they would all cross over in The Avengers, which I still stand by as one of the best popcorn summer movies of all time, right up there with Jaws and Star Wars. Earth's mightiest heroes return to take on a deadly threat in The Avengers: Age of Ultron.

Like a lot of summer movies, the film opens up with the Avengers in the middle of a mission in Sokovia; raiding a Hydra terrorist outpost. Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Hawkeye, Black Widow, and The Hulk each get their turn to show off their powers and strength as they break through to retrieve Loki's staff from the previous films. Though they are successful, they put up a goof fight with two new powerful beings; the really fast Quicksilver (played by Aaron Taylor-Thompson) and his twin magical sister Scarlet Witch (played by Elizabeth Olsen).

The Avenger celebration is put on hold when one of Tony Stark's newest creations, the artificial intelligent robot Ultron (played by James Spader) awakens, and has a more homicidal agenda with his mission to ""Save the Earth"". Ultron and some drones escapes back to Sokovia to build a large machine made out the same material as Captain America's shield. Attempts to go after Ultron fail and the Avengers find themselves fugitives as their actions create more destruction then save lives. Even with the help of a newly created Avenger, Vision (played by Paul Bettany), out heroes may have finally met their match.

The Avengers: Age of Ultron had a lot riding on this matching is predecessor; it had to up the action while keeping it's legendary tongue in cheek attitude as director Joss Weldon is known for. The pressure was also on to keep this cinematic story going for those that have seen the previous ones. The film succeeds in both, but falls within it too. The good news is that the action is really good. I never felt tired by the fights and it built itself up to an explosive finale like any good action movie should (please learn this lesson Michael Bay!).

We also get plenty of the great banter between our heroes when their just sitting around and building a plan. I just wish we had a little more of that. Between the action and the signature debates, the movie had to fill in the exposition of Ultron which got excessively complicated along with the discussion of the infinity stones, Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch's intentions, Thors Vision, the Vision being created, etc. I wouldn't be surprised if an extended cut surfaced on DVD later on that paces this stuff better then this shorter cut does (It's already long at two and a half hours, but it didn't really feel that long).

I'll give this eight Ultrons out of ten. It's not as well put together as the first and you kind of need to see the other movies before seeing this one, but The Avengers: Age of Ultron should make most Marvel fans happy and should continue bringing them back. Let's see what happens with Earth's mightiest heroes next.",8
I just didn't have much fun with this movie.,4 May 2015,,6
"This movie is faster than Quicksilver and weirder than Scarlet Witch, but is more fun than anything you've seen before",29 April 2015,"The best thing about Avengers: Age of Ultron, is also the worst. While Marvel followers like me will get satisfied by the excessive amount of action and super fighting, casual viewers could get lost between the intense battle and very quick references to other films from the franchise. Because even when Avengers: Age of Ultron is well crafted, can't stand on his own. It relies intensively in your knowledge of this universe and his colorful characters. It works as a sequel, but doesn't really move things forward, the villain, Ultron, for example, comes vaguely as a consequence of the Chitauri invasion from the last movie, but his presence don't really change anything, like other expendable villains in the MCU (Iron Monger, Whiplash, Killian, Red Skull, Malekith, Ronan, etc.), Ultron comes fast and goes even faster. The plot points are so many and the narrative is so fast that you can't hold a thought or really care about anything.

In the bright side, there's a lot of extended cameos and easter eggs, this is the most interconnected movie of the MCU so far. Also, this film introduces big players to the universe with Scarlett Witch, Quicksilver and of course The Vision, being this last one the most enjoyable surprise and probably the next fan favorite. There's very little dialog and almost no explanations, Age of Ultron is 90% action so the best you can do is switch the brain off and simply enjoy the fantastic ride.",8
Action done right,19 March 2016,"""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" raises the age-old question of just how much freedom we should be willing to sacrifice in order to ensure a lasting peace. And, as a corollary, how much power should humans be willing to cede to technology, particularly in the form of artificial intelligence, to achieve that goal? It's a theme that more than a few works of science fiction have dealt with over the years.

In this sequel to the box office smash of 2012, Ray Stark, aka Iron Man, has invented a program called Ultron whose purpose is to eliminate the need for war and global conflict altogether. To no one's surprise but Stark's, when the program is prematurely activated, it turns out to have less than noble intentions as it sets about creating a race of cyborg warriors to completely eradicate humans from the face of the planet and to repopulate it with others like himself.

Only the Avengers (embodied by Robert Downey, Jr., Chris Hemsworth, Don Cheadle, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Remmer, et. al.) can save the day. And save it they do, amidst supercharged action sequences and jaw-dropping special effects.

Stark certainly means well as he sets about essentially eliminating the need for the Avengers at all, but we in the audience know this is a fool's errand from the start for, if successful, there would be no more entries in this highly lucrative franchise. And we certainly couldn't have that, now, could we?",7

More pacier and punchier than the first,25 April 2015,,
Good Film Ruined by Awful Effects,13 March 2016,"When Tony Stark and Bruce Banner try to jump-start a dormant peacekeeping program called Ultron, things go horribly wrong and it's up to Earth's Mightiest Heroes to stop the villainous Ultron from enacting his terrible plans.

I may be in the minority, but I think the effects on this film look awful. When the heroes are standing still and the background is altered to make it look better, this is pulled off okay. But any time there is movement, it looks just ridiculously bad. Chases, fighting, and even the Hulk are very silly. How can this be acceptable? The inclusion of Quicksilver also seems to have been a big mistake. I understand why he was needed, but it did not have to be that way. If we had just focused on a good story (like the last ""Captain America"") this would have been better. I will give them bonus points for introducing Klaw, though... perhaps he will return in ""Black Panther""?",6
Best Marvel movie!,23 April 2015,"The new marvel has arrived with a bang and has taken the game to a newer height which seems to have no ends. First ,Marvel surprised us with the brilliance of a dark and gritty environment of ""dare-devil"" which made us knell for more and now a gem of a movie which has surpassed any expectation out of the ground of movie making. The movie is a perfect blend of heroism, with admirable human touch as well as a dark and humorous side which has risen from the ground to take what belongs to them, the rightful owners.

I wont bring out any spoilers in this post but will pass on the excellence of this movie. As everyone knows that the previous movie was a disaster with loopholes that made it look like as if it was created for children age groups. The expectation of this movie was very low while the trailers promised more. The highly expected part of the movie was the fight between Iron man's hulk buster and the green monster, Hulk himself.

The fight has been created in a way that Robert Downey jr , Mr iron man would try to smash the hell out of hulk and vise versa. After watching it like a child, i nearly yelled with happiness as it didn't disappoint but made it even more merrier. Everyone has been given a fair share of cinematic time whilst not separating any cast members of the Mighty avengers. The action seems to have evolved in another dimension ( some of the fights seems to be much computerized) which helps the movie to keep on rising to newer heights and to never stop till the end. The best thing about this movie is it has tried to create a attractive environment all till the end. There are dialogues between the actors but a more humorous side has seized the moment from ruining. The movie is in a ladder paced which doesn't drop at any given instance. The romance between the hulk and black widow seems to have given another chapter to the Avenger universe. From the birth of Ultron as shown in the trailer to the appearance of Vision, from the superb acting of Iron man and Bruce banner, This movie has left its predecessor into dust and has made a new mark in the way.

The most annoying moment of the movie however ,is the death of the character that marvel has promised and yes the ""THE END"" part where there was no credit scene or any other eggs left by the writers. ( or is there?)",9
Great!,14 October 2019,,7
An impressive piece of work by Director Joss Whedon and the crew of course,24 April 2015,"This movie is of course a very reasonable blockbuster. The movie is action packed and even a blink of of the eye can miss you some details for future upcoming movies in MCU. So 142 minutes of the movie is just as very well framed excellently. The new characters introduced are also very good and what to tell about the special effects. They are way more better, which is exciting and also even enthusiastic. The crew's acting,especially the role of Ultron was very good and is justifiable. In MCU, I think this movie is going to be a main benefactor for the continuation of other movies like Ant Man, Captain America Civil War,etc.",9
Felt more like a fourth Iron Man movie,18 December 2018,"I enjoyed this movie, and as I expected from most movies in the Avengers series, there were great acting, action and performances. But the idea for the story kind of felt like a filler in the series, and like it should have been named ""Iron Man 4"".",6
"Quality Superhero team flick, actually better than the first one",2 August 2015,"""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" (2015) is a quality superhero team movie. The first movie (2012) was so over-hyped that it was almost impossible NOT to be let down a little. It started good, but the set-up went on & on and wasn't overly absorbing, plus way too much time was spent on the SHIELD heli-carrier, which created a somewhat one-dimensional vibe; lastly, although Loki was a worthy villain, his army of Chitauri were stereotypically ee-vil, faceless villains who were basically just canon-fodder for the Avengers.

I like this one better because the ""origin"" element is out of the way and the setting isn't one-dimensional. There are numerous locations (England, Seoul, Bangladesh, South Africa and Italy), and additional characters like Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen). Ultron (voiced by James Spader) makes a worthy villain and the over-the-top action sequences are balanced out by quality character bits, like the Black Widow/Hulk/Banner relationship. Furthermore, the third act delivers with the requisite earth-threatening crisis.

When I heard Olsen was going to play Scarlet Witch a couple of years ago I was disappointed because she definitely didn't have the curves to pull-off a woman like Scarlet Witch, but she obviously gained weight for the role and looks great. She has a striking face and is quite a convincing actress. Taylor-Johnson is fine as Quicksilver, but I can't help wondering why they didn't use Evan Peters, who played the character in 2014's ""X-Men: Days of Future Past.""

There are so many quality superhero movies at this point that a new one is pretty much just more of the same. So ""Avengers 2"" creates a bit of a ""been-there-done-that"" vibe, but it's well done for what it is. What makes me grant it a fairly high rating, besides the positives already noted, are a couple of moving parts, the subplot about Thor's hammer and the revelation of another character in the third act that I wasn't expecting, which elicits a ""Wow"" reaction if you're familiar with the comic and even more so when you observe the tie-in to the aforementioned hammer.

Lastly, there's a lot to take in with ""Avengers 2,"" which makes it worthy of repeat viewings.

The film runs 141 minutes.

GRADE: A-",8
"Bigger and dumber than the previous one, but still a lot of fun, and even a bit better than I remember.",20 October 2020,"I remember finding Ultron very annoying and the pacing very rushed, but now I relly enjoyed him and the pacing, while still rushed, flowed a lot better.

The biggest problems are that the third act is a bit hard to follow and, worst of all, the stupid Hulk and Natasha romance. What were they thinking?

However, it also has some of my favorite MCU moments. The party sequence is amazing. Just the Avengers hanging out and being friends is wonderful to see. Hawkeye steals the show and becomes a much more interesting character. And the nightmare sequences are honestly terrifying.

It's messy, but more consistently enjoyable than I first gave it credit for.",6
"The Avengers are still trucking, but I think they hit a small bump in the road.",1 May 2015,"First time reviewer posting at almost 2 AM after seeing the late first night showing of Avengers: Age Of Ultron. I've found things to enjoy in every Marvel movie to date, even though each was not without defects (save possibly the first Avengers film).

I have to admit, I'm a fan of Marvel and the Cinematic Universe it has created. I like action, comedy, drama, romance, and Age Of Ultron stuffs in all four. The good was that all of our favorite Avengers are back, including cameos from characters in other films. There are new characters. However, it did seem a bit rushed, even with a 2 and a half hour run time, just because there was so much that they tried to fit in. Perhaps too much.

I will say that with a movie like this, you expect an overabundance of action (which there was), and comedy that doesn't overkill previous character jabbing (of which it walked a thin line). I enjoyed this movie for what it was by itself, and what it serves as another step on the road to Infinity War. I wouldn't rate any movie a 10 (although the first Avengers might have been). That is why I rate this so high. It didn't exceed my expectations, but it almost met them. Almost.

I have to say that I appreciated it more knowing that it was a piece of a bigger puzzle than I would have if it was a film by itself. Like I previously stated, the only film worth comparing it to was the first Avengers film. Despite everything familiar and cohesive and adding touches of newness and broadening of scope, it falls short. Or else it would have been the second film that I would possibly rated a perfect 10. I have enjoyed the ride so far, am looking forward to the rest of the MCU, but sadly, I may not look back at this film as much as the rest.",8
Marvel's MCU is not Marvel's Comic Book Universe - No Exception Here,24 July 2023,"I am puzzled at how the Avengers suddenly turn into a rowdy, quip-laden vigilante group. And hence, the rating.

The first Avengers movie was sensible: Loki brings aliens to take over Earth. Fine.

By the time this movie rolls around, the opening sequence is the Avengers in a foreign country, punching and kicking their way thru hostiles to retrieve Loki's sceptre. It is wrenching to watch, as is the sight of Thor throwing punches. A GOD, resorting to fistfights with his power level (at least in the comic books).

The film - if one completely ignores my Marvel Avengers dating back to 1963 - when was 13 - makes sense to those who think a fight is not worth having if there isn't at least 15 minutes of punches thrown. Fancy re-writing of Ultron's naissance (Hank Pym built Ultron, not Stark) allows the movie to proceed on its own terms, which include the Scarlet Witch having telepathic powers (she never did) grown in a laboratory (she's actually Magneto's daughter, lest one forget. Except that Marvel, 2,000 years later, reverses this: it was all a lie, the comic book readers were told!), and the Vision having the Soul Gem (nope).

As a movie on its own, it proceeds, punch by punch, to the standard climax except it is not so much a climax as a conclusion.

I can see how younger viewers (40 and younger) like their action movies to include constant punching by super-powered beings who should be able to dispatch their foes using their powers, but all that punching is hardly needed by super-powered beings, is it?

A confusing movie, what with the change in powers of the characters (Vision's Soul Gem is particularly since he never had it until Marvel re-wrote the entire comic book history), but Marvel seems to have its pulse on the public's sense of what a superhero group does, and apparently people find none of the constant battles more commonplace than necessary. Fair enough. Hence the rating.",6

Good but not great.,26 April 2015,"I've seen all the Marvel movies leading up to this one, and maybe Guardians of the Galaxy was just too good to follow.

A:Age of Ultron has a solid build up, but there are way too many slow chapters in it that both are uninteresting and poorly paced, but it kicks into gear again and finishes strong.

For me, Ultron was way too much just a robot James Spader, his classic wit and behavior seeped through and well.. I've heard that James Spader before a million times, so I never really connected to Ultron as a villain. And a movie like this with a Villain that doesn't get you either feeling a bit for him or utterly hating him, is lacking.

For me Age of Ultron was too much a stepping stone for the next Marvel movies, The Avengers movies should be the pinnacle of a story arc, not a chapter in the middle.

All in all a decent showing, but not even close to the first Avengers and even coming in behind CA: The Winter Soldier for me.",7
A GREAT way to start the 2015 Summer Blockbuster Season,3 May 2015,"With the release of AVENGERS: AGE OF ULTRON, the summer blockbuster season is upon us. People have a tendency to fall into 1 of 2 camps at this time of year - those that enjoy/look forward to these types of movies and...those who don't.

If you are in the 2nd camp, then you can stop reading right now.

If, like me, you look forward to the summer blockbuster, then AVENGERS: AGE OF ULTRON is a great way to start the season.

ULTRON, brings back all the players from the previous Avengers film and it has a feeling of old friends coming back together. Director Joss Whedon knows how to make these movies. The action is tight - and simple - with the goals easily laid out. Each character has something to do and humor is laced throughout this film to keep the sense of an amusement park roller coaster going.

But, it is the camaraderie of the cast that really makes this movie. Downey, Evans, Hemsworth, Johansson and Ruffalo all look at ease with this film - and each other, giving the sense that they enjoyed being back together. Jeremy Renner's Hawkeye FINALLY gets something important to do in this film and he shines in his role. Add to this newcomers Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen and the group really shines.

Whedon also makes good use of other familiar faces in the Marvel universe - Paul Bettany, Cobie Smulders, Anthony Mackey and Stellan Skargsard all show up (albeit briefly) to join in on the fun.

All this fun is counter-acted by the fine performance of the villain - James Spader's ULTRON. His silky smooth, unemotional (though VERY emotional) delivery makes him a villain not to be trifled with. With the menace in the previous Avengers film coming from outer space, it was good to see the nemesis in this movie come from within. I think I would have gotten tired with another outer space villain.

All in all, a rollicking good time at the movie theater. This is what a Summer Blockbuster should be. The bar has been set for the summer of 2015, it will be interesting to see if the other movies this summer can meet (or exceed) this bar.

8 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (of Marquis)",8
Solid but unmemorable,23 October 2019,"Rating

7/10

This follow up to the first Avengers movie is a significant step down but is still quite watchable. Big on spectacle and action it has a needlessly complex plot that seems to be setting up future sequels.

Solid but unmemorable",7
Pretty good Marvel effort,10 May 2015,"Seems likes its all or nothing on Ultron reviews, I would rather put this in the workmanlike Marvel category. It wasn't as outstanding as the first Avengers. On the other hand it wasn't forced or formula (yet), but it didn't seem quite as snappy and fresh the second time around. And the (intelligent) plot went in unexpected directions, which also led to a zig zag feel as we went down the road. The short version is that Hydra's experimentation with the teserak and artificial life leads, with some help from Mr. Stark, to the development of an apparently unbeatable being along with his associated minions.

I want to discuss Phil Coulson. I didn't like killing him in Avengers 1, I don't like when movies kill characters off, it seems like a cheap way to develop gravity or drama. I don't need for any good guy to get killed for the movie to mean something to me or to hold my interest. And of course Coulson was such a great character that they couldn't actually keep him dead. I was trying telepathically to connect with Mr. Whedon (I actually did try to get an email address) to suggest that he bring Phil's twin brother back for the next movie, have him be just like Phil, it could be a running joke about how much alike they are and lead to an endless line of twin/triplet/quadruplet brothers if and as they got eliminated.

But back to the main issue, there were some wrinkles to this (and the post-party Thor's hammer stuff was just great), but surprisingly some of this seemed a little tired even though the Avengers aren't really very old. Also, the original comic had a problem around issue 15 or so when the team got so good that it was hard to imagine a bad guy that would give them a good fight. It sounds like going forward this and the tired angle won't be as much of a problem, I will be interested in what Avengers 3 looks like. With all that's been said, I would still give this a solid 9.",8
Good Sequel but too focused on franchise building,9 July 2018,"Following the events of The Winter Soldier, the Avengers infiltrate a Hydra facility where they come across twins who have superhuman powers. It starts off big, loud and over-the-top, complete with a slow-mo money shot of the team. Big opening scenes like this are usually a risk as they can make the rest of the film feel underwhelming. Thankfully that isn't the case here because it's filled with relentless action sequences throughout. A few standout moments include a penthouse surprise attack, an enraged Hulk destroying a city and a chase scene in Korea. Some of the action scenes have choppy editing but the majority are well shot where we can see what is going on.

The plot centres around Tony Stark/Iron Man who creates AI robot Ultron. To disastrous results he becomes an evil version of Stark hellbent on destroying the world. Perhaps their hardest obstacle yet, he's intelligent and always one step ahead of them. He uses the super twins as his pawns whilst also using his own robotic army to wreak havoc on everyone else. James Spader steals the show, he is intimidating, creepy and often amusing.

It's a little more grounded this time as the Avengers try their best not to cause any civilian casualties as they know it will only have repercussions. It also has a darker palette which makes it look better than the previous film which was very colourful and bright. The dark tone isn't for everyone but it works well within the story. There are some grim moments including one scene where they all get warped visions of their past. It's full of exciting action set pieces which take us to other places in the world rather than just the US.

It's not without flaws though, there are a few new characters introduced which makes it feel overstuffed. It loses focus sometimes because there are so many subplots -Natasha suddenly has a crush on Bruce Banner, Clint/Hawkeye has a secret family and Stark learns nothing from his mistakes deciding to make another robot midway through. However one good thing about delving into Hawkeyes personal life (everyone's least favourite Avenger) isn't a bad move and makes us root for him. But there are just one too many character storylines which the film could have done without. The final showdown is great showing them working as a team to stop Ultron from destroying the world. But like most comic book films, it wraps things up too fast.",7

Predictable but entertaining,18 January 2021,"Avengers: Age of Ultron is an action Sci-Fi movie directed by Joss Whedon and stars Robert Downey Jr., Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Don Cheadle, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Elizabeth Olsen, Paul Bettany, Anthony Mackie and Samuel L. Jackson.

Whenever you are watching an Avenger movie you have some high expectations due to it's ensemble star cast and the type of technology they put for making the movie as they do not compromise on the budget. As far as this movie is concerned there is a small let down in some of the CGI and VFX scenes and acting of few cast members.

The plot of the movie is mostly predictable although has few twists and turns which increases the interest in the movie. Screenplay of the movie is fast paced and keeps the grip on the movie. Background music is decent. Acting is somewhat good although new character played by Elizabeth Olsen was little disappointing. VFX of the movie could've been little better. Climax of the movie is predictable but entertaining and gives a good closure to the movie.

Overall the movie is entertaining. Kids and typical Marvel fans will surely enjoy the movie. A must one time watch.",7
The Legal battle starts,2 June 2015,"Iv been told I have a high standard in movies, perhaps I do. But I guess when we are all treated to the cinematic prowess of Matrix 2 and 3, transformers 4 (but lets face it they all weren't that good going from ""ok sure' downward), pirates of the Caribbean 4, and even Jupiter ascending, that bar is set rather high. Hopefully that made my point.

The opening scene goes into an elaborate, over the top CGI'ed battle, that 4 or 5 minutes in works out where it went wrong and tones it down. Only to have that whole story line completely disregarded aside from a small one line for the rest of the film

I have never seen a good vs evil movie like this that I found myself rooting for the bad guy so much, as bad as the script writing for ultron was, James Spaders charisma still shone through and made me reminisce of better James Sader movies and TV series. Even the typical monologue stance of Alan Shaw was represented. However that is where the charisma halted. Also after an hour not sure who wouldn't be rooting for him to put us all out of our misery.

A love story thrown in the middle of it makes us raise our eyebrows for a second before realising it was just piled on top and no thought put into it. The battle scenes seemed more like something out of transformers where metal smashing into metal we are expected to know what is going on and which chunk of metal is the good and bad. The one liners.. oh the one liners

Everyone who loved the speedy kid in xmen days of future past got to see his twin European brother. The next avengers movie may work better as it might be the combination of the avengers and guardians of the galaxy, who I rate highly cause its like the creators know its not a serious movie, there is actual humour and characters you end up caring about cause its just good wholesome fun.

The 2 reasons this didn't get a 1/10 is James Spader; and I have seen 15 minutes of another movie that easily outdoes this movie as worst movie ever made.

All in all I want to explore my legal options in getting compensation back for losing 2 and a half hours of my life that I'll never get back.",2

Age of the Blockbuster: Marvel Restrains its Director From Taking On A Auteristic Tone,18 May 2015,"It's always hard to make sequels, especially sequels of highly successful films. The Avengers was a worldwide phenomenon back in 2012, it became the third highest grossing film of all time, and it established Marvel as the powerhouse of blockbusters. What was so successful in the first installment of The Avengers was its ability to bring so many stars together for one film. Director/writer Joss Whedon had managed to gather the likes of Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Captain America (Chris Evans), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner). For the second go round, Whedon had a more challenging task of appealing to comic fan-boys, cinematic critics, and the stars themselves (with the every growing cast, screen time is becoming more difficult to administer), all while topping the first film. However, Whedon has magically managed to pull off a film that achieves a kind of balance in all of these aspects with the second installment of The Avengers, The Avengers: Age of Ultron.

Age of Ultron finds our Avengers saving the world yet again from the decaying terrorist organization Hydra (last seen in Captain America: The Winter Soldier). Iron Man (aka Tony Stark) talks with the Hulk (aka Bruce Janner) about the possibility of creating an AI army that would be able to protect the world from any more alien threats; as Tony Stark puts it, it would be ""like a giant suit of armor around the world."" However, we all know what happens when you deal with AI: it always ends up turning on its creator. Tony Stark's first experiment, Ultron (voiced by a perfect James Spader) breaks from the confines of Stark's computer named Jarvis (voiced by Paul Bettany), and decides that the main threat to the earth is the humans themselves. Ultron is also able to recruit other super humans: the mind reading Scarlett Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) and the super fast Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor- Johnson). The only ones that can stop Ultron are the Avengers (duh). So voila, great plot and high stakes!

Whedon hasn't signed on for the next two Avengers films in the saga, and the thing is: I can't blame him. Marvel wants a clear-cut blockbuster, but with Ultron you can see brief sparks of Whedon's wit and art; something, which you could also notice was being restrained by Marvels magnates. The problem with caging up a director that wants to take risks is that the film itself risks falling into dullness. Fortunately Whedon was able to slip a couple of his brushstrokes; we especially see this in possibly one of the best scenes in the film when all the Avengers attempt to pick up Thor's hammer. It was one of those awkward almost Tarantino-ish moments. These brief flashes of Whedon help make the film slip into being an enjoyable and quality blockbuster. But the big challenge for this film was balancing the huge cast, while keeping the story moving forward. No matter how skilled of a director you are, to achieve that task with perfect marks is impossible.

I think that Whedon's big victory here was giving the new cast and lesser-known characters more screen time. Elizabeth Olsen, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, James Spader, and even Jeremy Renner, Scarlett Johnasson, and Mark Ruffalo trumped the likes of Robert Downey Jr. and Chris Evans who we usually end up sick with by the end of the movie. This screen time shift allowed the audience to delve into small characters, but it also allowed for the narrative to not become redundant with the previous film. Whedon's handling of the cast was magnificent. You could tell he kept all of his actors happy by giving them a chance to actually act. He manages to get a romance conflict between the Avengers, and other emotional stakes are set with family, children, and especially each other. This adds to the humanity and to the audience's care for the characters, so that you can tell that if one of them perishes, you will be devastated. The best part of this emotional upping, however, was that Whedon pulled it off without sounding cheesy!

In terms of the acting, what I most appreciated was how serious the cast took their characters. It didn't feel like a Fast and Furious film where you refer to the people on the screen by the actor's name. In this blockbuster there were actual characters, who were deeply crafted and very multilayered. This character development also helps this film differentiate from the first film, and it keeps the audience's intrigue.

However, one must not go into these films expecting to see a film as legendary and exceptional as The Dark Knight. Marvel's objective with its films is to simply make you marvel at their visual effects (see what I did there), and to keep you coming for more. With Age of Ultron, we see Marvel apply this logic. An unfortunately it ends up making the fight scenes elongated and even repetitive. But hey! What are you expecting from this type of film?

In the end Whedon manages to pull off a satisfying sequel that moves the Marvel universe closer to its final clash of the Guardians of the Galaxy and Avengers franchises. The blockbuster in requirement in Age of Ultron ends up sucking up too much of Whedon's freedom so that there is much less story in the film than there should be (for a two and a half hour film). Even so, the film is entertaining so you are never left bored for more than a couple of minutes, and while the jokes are starting become tacky like in the Die Hard and Fast and Furious films, most of them were able to hit home.",7
Less plot more action !,25 April 2015,"Sidenotes - Just for reference, people need to see Ultron in Avengers EMH animated series, to know how scary ultron's midset really is. Also the Stark-a-thon continues. Tony Stark is once again the center of the marvel universe. I love RDJ as iron man but the major focus on him is getting boring

When you hear that ultron is going to be in a live action movie you get chills down your spine, the psychotic imbalanced nature of the villain is in a league of the joker. But once you walk in for the movie you are treated with a human voiced robot, not even remotely creepy, PG-13 robot with a comedy routine. This Bot is bigger & badder than skynet & marvel failed to use him with those dark corners.

The PG-13 nature of the movie impacts so much on the it, at least i would have preferred it somewhere along the lines of arrow or agents of shield or agent carter, but this was supposed to be a mainstream marvel movie, having mainstream non-character acquainted people as a targeted audience makes some weird & annoying alteration to characters you love, looks like DC & Marvel wont play on the same aspects for some reason. Having arrow & black canery as a possible pair, has mostly diminished the possibility of the similar dynamic marvel has.

Quicksilver was damn awesome, the accent & the role he played when with avengers was befitting of having spidey in the movie. Vision was good too though i would have liked to see more of him. Both the Scarlets were good but i hope Wanda's personality is explored more in the next movies. It was great to know from an interview that ScarJo did some of her stunts in the movie

As for the plot, it didn't feel it had much depth, i could be wrong as there were many things at play but maybe some things could have been handled differently. Though what lacked in plot was somewhat atoned with feelings, mindsets & satisfactory over the top action.

I worry that ‪Marvel‬ will run the spidey film along the lines of the Crap Avengers Assemble cartoon, which i feel is the case judging by some of the dynamics at play in age of ultron.

To conclude it was a good movie experience, but no way as amazing as CAP2 or Avengers 1.",8
Ultron Madness to the max.,21 December 2021,"There is very little during this film that's new, however that does not matter. The characters square measure still diverting, the action scenes thrilling and close to orgasmic. The know-all Stark character and his friend Iron Man square measure rather more congestible paired with others United Nations agency have their own egos. Spider and also the Hulk court and cultivate a romance that's winsomely sexy. Aaron Taylor-Jackson and Elizabeth Olsen square measure good add-on villains/heroes.

Most of the team solid is male; all square measure white. The actors United Nations agency square measure folks of color square measure regulated to lesser, supporting roles. Viewers get a touch that consecutive Avengers sequel might feature the bench-warming B-team.",7
Times are changing,23 April 2015,"An amazing film but to be fair I watch it with the best 3D glasses that really enhanced every detail. The story line was excellent. Hydras meddling with tech they had no idea what it would bring and no doubt more to come. The humor and lines to give you a laugh in the tense moments which gave relief to my neck from tension for a few seconds was right on cue. The actors played their parts with precision and I am sure they had a lot of fun making this film. The credits go to the graphics and the support crew in the designs of the sets and costumes.

I highly recommend you watch it on a big screen in 3D and be prepared to an action filled movie.",9
Age of Ultron maybe one of the first of Marvel's films to show why making each film part of one long arcing story may not be the best ideas.,5 October 2016,,7
Best movie of 2015.. deal with it.,26 April 2015,"its a great movie with a lot of fighting scenes than the first movie and with great story line here where every previous and next movie will be connected to this masterpiece movie that made by Marvel/Disney, although some people are not so happy about the outcome of the movie and some people think that it can't beat the first one. but here's the thing here that people should think of, movie has a more complex story where they had to think of their own mistakes and their own destiny, it has more fighting scenes where less talk but with great script, Breath Taking fighting scenes, they focus on what Avengers really are, unlike the first one that they didn't think about the things they need to do first, the visuals are the best, and excellent watching in 3D.

As always not just in this movie, every sequels are not so much surprising as the first one because we are already expected this kind of scenes in the movie, but think this of this movie and the first one, i would rather vote for this the MCU greatest movie of all time (as of now).",10
Boooooring,15 January 2019,"Avengers 2 creates more depth to it's characters, everyone has a moment and a conflict. But at the same time it lost so many time trying to stablish the future that gets boring, slow and without focus or plot clear direction. Ultron has a lot of potencial, but finds himself in a lot of subplots and characters that he gets without enough time to be developed. The action is good at least and even better then the first one. Basically the only problem with age of ultron is the amount of subplots and characters trying to stablish the future.",7
"Age of Ultron is exciting, action-packed, and emotionally empty",3 May 2015,"Comic book films are often clichéd in their innovativeness. They are all wildly different, but all feel strangely similar, in their clanking, brawny, save-the-world-from-a-terrible-villain cesspools of ideas and characters. The thing that sets a comic book movie apart is usually one scene, be it a scene that depicts beauty, emotion, or simply an unusually awesome use of the all-seeing camera. In Guardians of the Galaxy, we had the scene in which Groot sends a cascade of glowing spores into the air. In The Dark Knight, we had the unforgettable interrogation scene (among many others), where we were exposed to the visceral world of insanity. In Iron Man, we had the ""Tony Stark has a Heart"" motif. Without these moments, these comic book movies would be what they advertise themselves to be: Simple, sexist, and action packed to the point of insanity.

Age of Ultron is that not-so-rare comic book movie with an intriguing setup, formidable villain, snarky humour, the optional dose of character drama, and women in tight clothing. It is well made and engaging, the camera-work is mostly seamless, the scene where Ultron is introduced is excellent, and there are a lot of fancy explosions. But Age of Ultron falls short of its better predecessors in a few keystone elements.

Firstly, it lacks a powerful scene. Most of the scenes are visually commanding, that is true, but there is no scene that makes the film memorable for its grasp of the human condition. There is the occasional goodbye, but these scenes did not inspire any sort of feeling whatsoever. I remained completely unmoved for the duration of the film.

Secondly, the final battle scene is not engaged enough. It keeps cutting away from the action to some random talking that no one cares about, not allowing the audience to immerse itself in the action that they paid for.

These elements notwithstanding, Age of Ultron is a good escapist film and James Spader's depiction of the robot Ultron is really darn cool.",5
What plot what happened,16 September 2015,"Did somebody hide a Zucchini in the Vibranium and this was how Ultron's AI is born? What was up with that dreadful plot, well at least it has managed to build into a trilogy? Although the only really funny part was Checkov dying, he didn't see the chaingun firing, you must be joking? Mass produce Ironman 3 bots, now Hulk smash them over and over and over and over again, presto the result of the film. Thankfully Pepper Pots didn't join in. All because these Ultron bots had the most annoying Atom (Watchmen) accents ever. The dialogue was boring, the plot was totally screwed, the action was utterly repetitive.

Yawn! Apart from some of the better action sequences, there was nothing there, no nothing at all. The actors mostly looked like they went through some motions mostly of something else somersault to go out and get paid. They just didn't jive.

The first film was epic, this second film is such a lame comparison.",
The age of size of a match: short but bright,7 May 2019,"Once you start doing something it's hard to stop. That's the case with the Avengers: even without the imminent and devastating danger they keep working together even on issue of local scale, which gives us the opportunity to see the pompous show-off and some cool teamwork. However, when it comes to such a grand title we expect something massive to happen. What can possibly be bigger that the attack from outer space?

Apparently, there are many ways to endanger the peace on the planet, and, as it mostly happens, the reason is a human mistake. The artificial intelligence always has scared people and the idea of it getting evil has troubled the minds of many geniuses over times. The most prominent example is the Terminator. So here comes the Marvel interpretation of the AI problem with a savior-turned-villain creation of Tony Stark that grew its twisted conscience and decided to make the world better.

The creators have an enormous collection of good and bad characters; I really appreciate the effort of introducing us to more and more unique figures of the universe, which makes every movie a surprise for every fan. The stand-off between the two opposing sides kicks off several times and, frankly, every encounter gets better and better.

The dark cloud that shades the sun here is the talks. The long, boring and repeating speeches explaining the reasoning. Sure, they make the bad guy look worse and the armor on our knights shine better, however, the preciseness is a key to success.

On the side of the action one can say that the sequel has kept the pace and even tried to outperform the predecessor. From a nice team fight to a duel of a year that was on everyone's mind to even bigger final clash. The hallmark of a franchise is a slow-motion group interlude, which looks cool but only there to stress the fact that it's not a solo movie feels overused but what won't you do to please the fans.

I am going to go ahead and say that the idea is not new but still interesting and with a few novel tricks up the creators' sleeves, however, the outcome of a story is a little bit disappointing. Some might say that it wrapped up too easily and I will totally agree, Ultron with all its computational power turned to be just an improved version of my pocket calculator - I hoped for more.

Dipping the feather into the ink I will end up this history chapter by saying that the 'age' is a too big word, because the length of this ""reign"" was hysterically short although it for sure was impressive. The second part did a solid job but it didn't jump as high as the pioneer of the franchise, all my hopes are that we will get some more stories that next generations will wish they could have watched on the time of the premiere.",7
A Complete Review of this Movie in One Sentence,1 May 2015,,10
Joss Whedon needs a hug; Would Recommend,24 May 2017,"'Avengers: Age of Ultron' is the second feature film in the MCU's 'Avengers' franchise and was directed by Joss Whedon. It stars Tony Stark Jr, Chris Evans and James Spader and is the story of Ultron(James Spader), a psychotic robot created by Robert Downey Jr and Bruce Banner to stop all wars before they even begin.

It was impossible for this movie to live up to the absurdly high hype that came of off 'Avengers Assemble' and the other MCU movies. It really was but I still feel that people were too harsh on Joss Whedon. Seriously, the guy needs a hug. He was bullied by movie goers because this movie didn't reach the heights of one of the best movies of 2012. I feel bad for the guy. He made a fun, action packed movie with a stellar cast and fun villain but was manhandled by smaller people? Oh children that's right I forgot the word there for a second. In all seriousness, this movie is very entertaining and fun is you can ignore the absurd plot and tropes carried over from movie to movie.

Speaking of absurd plot, the plot is absurd. The term 'Age' implies 2000+ years of something, not a week. The concept of Ultron was really cool and they could have made a very creative(and possibly, if they did it right, satirical) doomsday device that involved our mass reliance on technology and the internet. They do try to cram a LOT into one movie and fail miserably at it. It think this was a Feige issue and not a Whedon issue because he has said how many restrictions and guidelines he had to follow and that undoubtedly interfered with his vision for this movie. Something happens in this movie that should have meant a lot but it doesn't have as much of an impact as it should and therefore feels very wasted and like botched potential.

Right, let's get the obvious out of the way. Tony Stark is excellent as Roberty Downey Jr. Downey Jr is just such a charismatic guy and he makes Stark a very memorable character. This is only heightened by Chris Evan's much better performance of Captain America. There is more back and fourth between Evans and Stark than there was in the Korean War. Scarlett Johanson was good as Black Widow, as was Mark Ruffallo as Bruce Banner but the 'relationship' between the two felt so forced and contrived and had little to no buildup to make it successfully work. Chris Hemsworth was good as Blondie but I feel like his presence was neither necessary nor warranted. Jeremy Renner as good as Hawkeye and the wonderful producers at Marvel Studios decided we needed a reason to like him so that when he kicks the bucket in Infinity War we'll actually give one(I refuse to count that as profanity). Elizabeth 'Hand Wavy' Olsen was weak as Scarlett Witch as her 'superior acting method' consisted of doing stuff with her hands in the air and, occasionally forging an accent. Aaron Taylor-Johnson did better as her 'brother' Quicksilver but his purpose was to be there and not for anything else. Paul Bettany was great as his character in the movie and was a very welcome and entertaining surprise. Plus, dat hamma scene tho. Now for arguably the most controversial part of this movie, Ultron. I understand that Ultron wasn't as menacing as people wanted him to be but I appreciated Spader's approach to the character. Having him share similar qualities to that of his maker(Robert Downeyy Jr) was an excellent choice and gave further levels to the character. He was definitely one of the better MCU villains but that is like saying something is one of the better ways to get stabbed.

Once more, I adore Whedon's beautiful cinematography and his long, unedited tracking shots and stunning to behold. On the flip side of that argument, while some scenes(such as the opening sequence) were amazingly shot and edited, scenes such as the church scene were horrifically edited and were done extremely poorly. The effects were amazing and looked awesome(I wouldn't say they looked as impressive or cool as 'Avengers Assemble' but that is just my opinion). I do think the set design was pretty generic and they could have done quite a bit more with it to make it appear more lively.

This movie needed to provide some fun action, fun humour and set up ((37*(x**40)) + (π*407³)(Have fun maths nerds!) movies in the process. The action is very fun and arrives when it's needed. Amidst the incredible action, there is also deep, heartfelt character moments and some of them worked. The one liners were most funny but some of them were were very profanity filled and that is offensive to Cap/Disney. As for setting up movies, it does to that but it could have been done so much cleaner and work so much better. Another thing this movie had to do was involve stakes but it doesn't feel like it does that. This is a glaring issue with MCU movies and hopefully they'll fix this in 'Infinity War'.

The music was very good.

In conclusion, this movie is not as good as 'Avengers Assemble' or 'The Winter Soldier' or even 'Iron Man' but it is a very enjoyable movie and better than a lot of MCU movies. The cast is still stellar and Whedon proved he direct action competently with his other movies. If you want a fun way to spend your two hours, I will recommend you see this movie because it is very fun and enjoyable to watch.

In which Iron Man and Hulk fight,11 May 2015,"The second Avengers movie is one of those that just plain makes me happy. And, judging by the box office so far, it's made a lot of other people happy as well. It's a grand continuation of the adventures of familiar characters, but it's so witty, original, and exciting that it's also a terrific stand-alone film.

The gang's still around, even though their former employer SHIELD is not. Captain America (Chris Evans) leads the team as they try to root out the last of the HYDRA cells. They do, and they recapture the scepter of Loki, who does not appear in this movie. This leads Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) and Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) to decide to revive a dormant AI program, all in the name of peacekeeping, because those things never go wrong. It's clear that Stark would rather move on to do something other than save the world every couple of days, and so he figures the new AI, Ultron, can finally bring peace to the world. Whoopsie! Spoiler alert: It does no such thing.

The really awful thing about Ultron isn't that he's super-intelligent and powerful (even more so than JARVIS, Stark's AI-servant), it's that he can pop up in any machine, anywhere, because that's just what you'd expect an evil machine to do - upload himself to the Internet and wreak some havoc.

Ultron (James Spader) comes across twins who are totally not mutants at all because that would infringe on Fox's X-Men copyright - Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor-Johnson), who's fast, and Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen), who's good with the mind games. The bad guy plans to use the duo's loathing of Tony Stark (it's complicated) to help him rid the world of the Avengers.

Meanwhile, inner conflicts begin to brew among our heroes. Is Stark truly selfish and not a team player? Can Hulk totally Hulk out without making the civilian populace terrified of him? Is Black Widow (Scarlett Johannson) able to deal with her own demons long enough to establish a relationship with Banner? And is Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) good for anything? Joss Whedon once said (reportedly) that working with the Avengers characters is much more demanding than working with, say, the X-Men characters, because the latter share common problems (i.e., they're mutants). The Avengers have different problems from one another, different personalities, and different enemies. One is a god from another realm, and another is in his eighties (technically). So it's not just a matter of getting them to work together as a team against a single enemy, as the different backgrounds sometimes run counter to each other.

Of all of the characters, though, I think Black Widow is the most layered. We know that Natasha has been through an awful lot, even compared with her teammates, and that's why she's more or less a closed book to them. I also think Johannsson provides an exciting, vulnerable, empowering performance. She's not just playing a superhero - she's a full-fledged character.

There are some familiar faces, too - Nick Fury pops up. Sidekicks (sort of?) for I-Man and Cap also make appearances. There is much joking; hilarity often ensues. There's a new layer of levity, in fact. There's an early scene in which Cap takes out a bunch of henchmen with his shield and mutters (paraphrasing here) ""Well, that was fun."" This is followed by, off-screen, ""No, it wasn't!"" Hee! Hee! With the panache of an old-time serial and the touch of the pathos of a Douglas Sirk drama, the Avengers sequel is a visionary omnibus of meshing styles and genres. I'd call it the pinnacle of comic-book movies, but we have at least two more Avengers films - plus Ant-Man, another Captain America, and on and on.",9

Avengers:a few days of Ultron,1 June 2016,,7
Superhero Saturation?,24 April 2015,"The first Avengers film was an awesome film. It lived up to all expectations, and fans filed out of the cinema generally very happy and excited about the superhero extravaganza they had just seen. This sequel therefore had a much bigger fan expectations to fulfill. Now that the novelty of having all these heroes together has already passed, it now depends on a great story to pull this second installment through. My verdict is that while it is still a larger-than-life, visually- impressive action film, it did not exactly inspire the same level of adulation that the first one so handily developed.

The adventure starts in a fictional European country of Sokovia where the Avengers were attacking the Hydra lair to retrieve Loki's scepter. The blue stone in that scepter contain powerful artificial intelligence technology which Tony Stark and Bruce Banner uses to create Ultron, the ultimate peace-keeper for the world. Ironically however, Ultron believes that humanity needs to be eradicated in order to achieve peace.

Ultron recruits the powerful Maximoff twins, super-speedy Pietro and telepathic Wanda, who have an axe to grind against Tony Stark. The action reaches a peak back in Sokovia where Ultron develops a machine to lift a huge segment of the city up to the sky with the intent of dropping it down to cause global annihilation. Together with new allies they pick up along the way, the Avengers have to regroup and gather their forces together in order to foil Ultron's twisted quest for human extinction.

While the requisite bad-ass fight scenes and humorous zingers are still there, but there was something I can't exactly put my finger on that affected my enjoyment of the film overall. Maybe it was the sheer number of characters we need to focus on so the storytelling can be messy at points. Every character had their own personal issues to address, such that some parts of the film tended to lag down. Maybe it was how Thor seemingly became the unexpected comic relief for the film. Maybe it was how I was not used to seeing Natasha as a hopeless romantic or as a damsel in distress. I don't know, I enjoyed the film for sure, but there was just something amiss somewhere.

I did like the part where we see Clint Barton's home and meet his family. We get to see the super-archer in a much different light and these scenes gave Jeremy Renner his moment to shine after being underused in the first film. Strangely for a film with so many characters, Hawkeye is the ONLY one in whom you can connect emotionally.

I liked the new characters this film introduced to us. The Scarlet Witch (played by Elizabeth Olsen) is a very powerful heroine with awesome abilities. It should be interesting how her character will develop future films. The scenes building up to the birth of Vision are positively sublime -- so well done! Paul Bettany transitioned from being the voice of JARVIS to his personification as Vision very fluidly. The main antagonist Ultron was voiced with buttery calm by James Spader. I admit I felt there was some disconnect between the coolness of the voice with the expectation of pure nefariousness for this villain.

There was a short extra scene in the middle of the end credits featuring an Infinity Gauntlet and one character whom we last saw in ""Guardians of the Galaxy"". I thought I would see more though. And no, to the disappointment of fans who patiently waited, there was no second extra scene at the very end of the credits. There was only the promise that ""The Avengers will return"". That return is reportedly going to be in May 2018.

Overall, this is still one big bang of a film. Those dynamically blocked and executed sequences where all the Avengers were fighting side-by-side were a joy to watch. Writer-director Joss Whedon tried his best to weave together a fan-friendly, action-filled film with more than 10 superheroes, yet still managing to maintain some sort of story coherence, while connecting to past and future Marvel films revolving around this universe.

But I think the decision to relinquish the directorial reins of the next Avengers films to the Russo Brothers (who did an excellent job in ""Captain America:The Winter Soldier"") may be a good idea in order to inject some fresher ideas before more signs of franchise fatigue start to show. 8/10.",8

"Joss Whedon, I hope you're happy",6 May 2015,"This movie is what's wrong with Hollywood, It's overlong, pretentious, terribly paced, has one of the cheesiest openings that I've ever seen in a blockbuster with every hero mugging for the camera while they charge into battle, and is probably the most over hyped blockbuster ever made. This is coming from someone who loved the first movie. This movie seemed like it was cut from a cookie mold and sold to the masses as if it were some sort of ""hip new age drug"" when all it manages to do is make me feel embarrassed for everyone involved.

This is probably my least favorite blockbuster of all time, I wish I could go back in time and warn my previous self to never watch this pile of garbage. I regret paying for this movie on opening night more so than paying to watch Wild Wild West, and I even got a public apology from the main actor of THAT movie for going to see it!

This movie is a complete mess and a waste of time. You can argue all you want and troll all you want, but deep down inside you truly know this movie is utter drivel and nonsense. This movie doesn't even seem like it was made by the people involved with the first. The jokes are terrible and there are so many, which the first didn't suffer from, the main villain was a joke, Every hero tries to get the same amount of screen time almost like they're fighting over who gets to mug the camera more, and to top it all off we have the egos of Chris Hemsworth and other actors to cope with.

I get that Winter Soldier and Thor: The Dark World were big hits in theaters, but to me they reeked of what this movie has to offer. In fact those movies remind me of this movie so much that I had to look back at the main door to make sure I wasn't in the wrong movie a couple of times. If this is what passes for entertainment nowadays, then I fear for what's going to be passed off to us in the next couple years to come. Hopefully the DCU movies will stray away from this type of formula and come up with something original, but I don't see that happening.

This is what happens when a children's company buys your IP and decides to run it into the ground Marvel! Do you not remember the amazing mess of The Weekenders meets Spiderman from your Ultimate Spiderman cartoon. In fact with the jokes happening and cutting to other heroes who was to mug the camera, this movie reminds me a lot of The Weekenders. So basically you did it to two of your IP now....

All in all, if you want to turn your brain off and come out of the theater like you just pounded back a 40 of liquor.. Then this movie I suppose is for you? But if you want something more out of the movies you watch, then don't waste your time with this nonsense. I'm ashamed to have seen this movie and I feel bad for Joss Whedon because I know he's capable of so much more. Just had to sell out to Hollywood didn't you Joss?",1
Just okay!,24 April 2015,"Nowhere near The Avengers. No epic moments! Remember that moment when Tony flew that nuke into the other world and saved earth? Well, don't expect anything to blow your mind in this one. Ultron was a huge disappointment, I really wanted him to be a scary villain with a lot of potential to cause damage. He made lame jokes in the movie(Of course, he is Tony's sliver, but Tony doesn't crack lame jokes) and Ultron's CGI sucked! His lips were curling! WTF? He's a robot! There was nothing great about the script either. It was like, yeah I've seen that, what's new?

As from the point of being just a movie, it was the same good old entertainment that Marvel has mastered and it's super heroes have executed. Good movie to watch, but don't get your hopes high.",7
Avengers Assemble!!,3 May 2015,,8
Age of Ultron,28 May 2019,"Avengers: Age of Ultron

Average at best, with things getting more and more technologically complicated, yet a storyline which is 'ok'. Compared to the previous Avengers movie, age of Ultron is a downgrade I feel. The novelty of these superheroes coming together is completely worn off. Again, a common reoccurrence is the character of Tony Stark and Iron man pulling the cart with the rest of them on. Can't help but begin to feel that these Marvel films are heavily reliant on Downey Jr.

Body forms of A.I arena interesting part of the series, but it's becoming more and more fantastical with each movie. An example is the introduction of the mind control human...that's a no from me in afraid.

Overall a good attempt, but I feel that even some stand alone movies are more worthy of superheroes than this! J-Boss Reviews gives 6.8",7
Funny and action packed,20 May 2015,"Many people are disliking the movie for the wrong reasons. If you are not a movie elitist who likes to say things such as ""Hollywood is ruining movies"" or ""there are too many superhero movies today"", you will most likely walk away entertained by this movie.

The central cast is yet again great here. Whedon is clearly the man, when it comes to writing and directing an Avengers movie (although I do have high hopes for the Russo brothers). The dialogue and interactions between the main cast is excellent and the actors have great chemistry with each other.

Ultron might be an understandable let down for some, but for me he was an excellent villain. The trailer painted him as a totally menacing and scary robot, but that is not the case here. The best way to describe him is that Ultron, is essentially an evil and robotic version of Tony Stark. He has many one-liners which makes him a very funny villain to watch, but he still does evil things. James Spader was the perfect actor to give voice to this iconic comic book foe.

A common and strange critique against this movie is the romance angle. It takes at most 5 minutes of the total movie length and it raises the question if The Avengers can have normal lives. This did not bother me at all.

The movie did have ACTUAL problems though. One of which was the abundance of action scenes. Don't get me wrong, they were all very well done, but there were too many of them, which left little room for more character interactions like the ones from the previous Avengers movie. Also, Nick Fury should have died in Captain America: Winter Soldier. His presence here was too long and he contributed to a very annoying deus ex-machina moment. There are also many plot holes in the movie, which will lead a lot of people questioning what is going on. Age of Ultron also had too many story lines too jumble, which could bother a lot of people (especially if they are not up to speed with the comics).

Overall Age of Ultron is a solid superhero movie. It is not as good as the first one, but it is not bad either. I watched the movie twice and I did not regret a single euro spent.",8
Meh,3 July 2021,"Nice action scenes.

Boring plot.

Bad script.

"An entertaining, if messy, Avenging adventure",15 May 2015,"https://freeglader.wordpress.com/2015/05/04/avengers-age-of-ultron/

From the get-go the film throws its viewership straight into the action (where we remain for the most part), weaving through an intensely choreographed fight scene trying as it might to feature each of its heroes in equal measure. There's Captain America throwing his shield, Thor spinning his hammer, Hulk smashing, and so on, typically showing off the team 'on a good day' (climaxing at a particularly exciting slow motion shot of said team leaping into the fray). This high octane pace rarely slows, and though the action sequences often feel very crowded, they still manage to be enjoyable rather than overwhelming, even if it's more difficult to watch the individual heroes doing their thing as in the first Avengers film.

The film is, of course, centered around the titular character – Ultron, derived with some jiggery-pokery from Loki's staff (yep, that old thing), he is an AI gone wrong, unable to tell the difference between destroying humanity and saving it (peace either way, right?). But if you were expecting evil death robot #232 think again, this Ultron isn't so much doom and gloom as hitting off one liners at a similar rate to the protagonists, James Spader masterfully voicing him as another character rather than a malfunctioning droid. Of course, with this it can be argued that he loses much of his menace, being more of a comedy bad guy than a legitimate threat (not helped by the fact he gets bashed around by the protagonists constantly), but considering the amount of emotionless world- ending antagonists we get in robotic form, it's quite refreshing to have one with a personality.

Two other new characters are introduced in the film as well, Wanda and Pietro Maximoff, played by Eizabeth Olsen and Aaron Taylor-Johnson respectively. They are known more recognizably as Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver (""He's fast and she's weird"", as it was put in the film), who bring an interesting dynamic as two 'enhanced' (saying mutant is punishable by death, as made clear by multiple contracts between Fox and Marvel) people capable of fighting the Avengers with a more varied set of skills (as fun as a living Iron Man suit big bad robot is), Scarlet Witch using her 'mind control' power to induce a dream state on several of the protagonists, creating a very memorable sequence.

However, Age of Ultron is definitely not without its flaws, these mainly revolving around a somewhat messy and disjointed story. Though it can be felt in some of the more chaotic fight scenes, this lack of cogency is exemplified by a certain section wherein Thor flies off and does something almost totally irrelevant to the main plot, with little to no explanation, resulting in nothing more than sequel baiting while the rest of the film carried on. This contrasts deeply with the first Avengers film, which was focused and clear throughout, while this film feels very much like it has strings attached (whatever Ultron may have you believe), those being the various stories of the Marvel Universe and the overarching build up to the inevitable films that will follow. That said, the small momentum lost by such asides is not overly painful and they are quickly forgotten as soon as the main plot gets back on screen.

Interestingly for a movie that barely stops for breath, some of the slower and less action-packed parts are in fact the highlights, both very funny and offering character development which is usually a rarer find in superhero movies. Aside from the one-liners, Whedon manages to create some interesting character dynamics, be it Robert Downey Jr. and Mark Ruffalo's ""mad scientist"" duo as Tony Stark and Bruce Banner, or perhaps more interestingly Banner and Black Widow's (Scarlett Johansson) romantic sub-plot, which at times touches on more mature themes than a Marvel film is used to. Yet despite all this, the star of the show in terms of character development may well be the much maligned Hawkeye (played by Jeremy Renner), who spent most of the first movie as a brainwashed zombie type fella, and was otherwise a seemingly superfluous member of the team picking off a few bad guys with a bow and arrow of all things. This time Hawkeye gets a fair bit of screen time and uses it well (even picking up on the absurdity of, not only the plot, but the fact he has a bow), and it seems likely he'll be a fan favourite from here on in.

All in all, Age of Ultron is a huge film. Unlike its predecessor it spans four continents, giving it a truly global feel, and is so jam packed with heroes and villains it almost splits at its seams (the planned extended home release suggests there is even more, if that can be believed). And though it might be 'a bit much' at times, it offers spectacle so far unmatched in Marvel's cinematic outings, and blow for blow probably exceeds the first Avengers film in terms of enjoyment – even if Marvel's future offerings only reach as high as this movie manages, we're still in for a treat.",8
"OK , but lost some of its charm from the first film",28 April 2015,,7
A Step away from Greatness,3 May 2015,,8
Frankenstein's Avengers,29 September 2019,"This sequel, ""Avengers: Age of Ultron,"" is surely flawed, but it's an interesting mixture of two popular movie genres: the relatively new comic-book superhero one, which has only recently emerged to dominate the box office in this age of Hollywood franchises, and the older genre of the horror film. Both may've been originally (or still) sneered at by many--perhaps, even for good reason, including repetitious and superficial fan servicing--but they've been extraordinarily popular. Last year, during the 200th anniversary of Mary Shelley's novel ""Frankenstein,"" I reviewed a bunch of related films in relation to that book, as well as seeing how such shockers became a Hollywood staple. For some reason, I neglected two superhero pictures that are partly based on ""Frankenstein."" Both are in part made by Joss Whedon, who had already mixed pulpy vampirism with teen drama for TV with ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer,"" and he was behind the meta-horror of ""The Cabin in the Woods"" (2012). So why not rework Shelley's creation for comic-book characters, which he's done here and did again, later, with ""Justice League"" (2017).

The Marvel Cinematic Universe has unleashed a whole new monster of franchise building; one need not look far for its imitators to see that it's become the envy of the motion-picture world, but even if one traces the superhero franchise back to the Christopher Reeve Superman films and the Tim Burton Batmans, this genre is relatively young. Going any further back, comic-book film adaptations become the pure kiddie stuff of cartoons and serials. The Hollywood horror film, on the other hand, dates back to 1931 when Universal released ""Dracula"" and, soon thereafter, ""Frankenstein."" Both based on 19th-century Gothic horror novels, although more so their theatrical iterations over the years. Both were box-office successes, too, but they also received harsher criticism than any recent superhero movie has; they were censored, and the genre was de-facto banned for a few years. Later, these monsters launched the first shared cinematic universe beginning with ""Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man"" (1943). Now, they're considered classics, and although ""Age of Ultron"" may never be considered that, ""The Dark Knight"" (2008), say, or ""Logan"" (2017) already are. All of which is to say that these two types of cinemas seem a natural fit. Moreover, Gothic horror such as ""Dracula,"" ""Frankenstein"" and ""Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,"" in particular, are about science and modernity, alter egos and supernatural abilities.

""Age of Ultron"" hints at its scary-movie roots from the start with the Avengers attacking what is essentially a haunted house on a hill. Just look at the way Scarlet Witch (apt name there, too) floats backwards through a door that seemingly closes on its own, as though she were Dracula. Heck, she even has mesmerizing powers to read others' minds and trick them into dreams. The faux Eastern European accent only completes the Bela Lugosi imitation--you know, except she blasts red magic energy from her hands and body. The haunted house also features a mad doctor's dream laboratory where artificial intelligence was being mined from one of those supernatural infinity stones. The two mad doctors of the Avengers, Tony Stark/Iron Man and Bruce Banner/Hulk (the latter of whom has always essentially been a derivative of Jekyll/Hyde, except with smashing replacing Robert Louis Stevenson's original drug abuse and sexual promiscuity), then, take this magical tech back to their lair's lab to, basically, inadvertently unleash a Frankenstein monster, Ultron. This robot creature even stumbles into the Avengers party like he were Boris Karloff freshly reanimated and just learning how to walk and what to think. The Avengers will teach him that ""fire bad""--or at least that laser things shot out of superheroes bad for robots--soon enough, too.

Furthermore, Captain America reminds us that he was the experiment of a German scientist and was reanimated from a frozen state. Likewise, Black Widow's flashback dream includes remembering that her body was altered, too, to create the weapon that she is today (for feminist critics of this storyline, this is why it exists). The reason Hawkeye is the ""heart"" or ""soul"" of the team this episode is probably because he's the only one who doesn't think of himself as something of an engineered or otherwise supernatural monster. Iron Man has an electrical plant for a heart and is a man dressing as a robot. Hulk is inching closer to Mr. Hyde entirely out of the control of Dr. Jekyll. The Witch and her speedy brother were also made in a lab. Even Fury is missing an eye. And Thor is an alien god running around with a magic hammer on Earth, for crying out loud.

Thus, we have a cast of characters who are something of Frankensteins themselves, who then go on to more blatantly reference the 1931 ""Frankenstein"" film is giving life to another AI robot (whether with synthetic skin or vibranium what have you or not), Vision. The god of thunder even comes back from his vision quest in a magical pool to provide the lightning bolt of a spark of life to the creature. Indeed, the Vision body was originally planned as the creation of Ultron, who brain washed his own mad scientist for the purpose. So, there is quite a bit of Frankenstein creating going on here. As Tony tells Bruce, ""We're mad scientists. We're monsters, buddy. You've got to own it.""

I enjoy this stitched-together from various genre and technical body parts aspect even if does lead to an imbalance of dark lighting and production design for talking scenes out of a horror movie conflicting with action sequences shot in daylight complete with interruptions of slow-motion superhero poses and bad one-line jokes. (Cap's aversion to cursing especially pisses me off. He was reanimated from fighting super-Nazis, not from ""Leave It to Beaver;"" he should act like it, dammit.) Plus, there's the usual modern-movie dichotomy of live action mixed with CGI animation, which continues to improve. Some of the picture is blandly unimaginative, though. There's too much set-up for future franchise installments. A fight sequence on a runaway train seems particularly to be a rip-off of the better scene from ""Spider-Man 2"" (2004). Although James Spader provides an amusingly chatty voice for a robot, the character is very reminiscent of ""The Terminator"" franchise; AI awakes, gets into the interweb, manufactures an army of mechanical clones, seeks to destroy mankind--we've seen it before. And the Quicksilver character pales in comparison to the version from the prior ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" (2014).

The apology theme for the Avengers' military adventurism is lackluster, as well. It worked better in ""Iron Man"" (2008) as a reflection of the War on Terror. And, really, do they have to make up places--""Sokovia?"" I'll accept ""Wakanda,"" but what precisely is the political point they're dancing around to try not to offend anyone with this vaguely Eastern European country? I sense this militarism of the Avengers, read (Captain) America, should be another Frankenstein monster here, but it's too muddled. Much of ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" is alive, but some of the body is dead parts.",6
Worst Avenger film in quadrilogy,29 October 2020,,2
New content for an existing schema,23 May 2015,"Avengers: Age of Ultron could be very well defined and summarized as what Downloadable Content (DLC) is for video games.

There is nothing significantly new in comparison to the previous movies in the Marvel universe. Almost all main characters sport only a slight addition to their arsenal and - apart from the two new characters, Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch - there is no significant change in the cast.

The movie gets straight to the point without _any_ prelude: action scenes. This, however, also introduces some plot-holes considering where previous movies of the Marvel universe left off; none of which is important in the context of Age of Ultron, but can be considered significant for those looking for the bigger picture.

If you liked what you saw before in the previous installments, and are itching for some more action, a new streak of moves and cheesy one-liners instead of re-watching the old ones for the 10th time, this is definitely something for you, no doubt.

The battles are very spectacular and full of ideas. You also get to see surprisingly new sides of select characters, which is interesting, but doesn't add significantly to the plot. Take this movie lightly, bring popcorn, and expect top-quality CGI.",7

"A FANTASTIC FILM, SEQUEL & MY FAVOURITE AVENGERS FILM",19 August 2019,"Age of ultron actually beats the brilliant first film, i absolutely LOVED Avengers Assemble & Age of ultron is an even better film than that!!!

The opening scene is action packed excitement, the Avengers are on a mission & are battling Hydra soldiers through a snowy forest & it's a breathtakingly beautiful sequence!!! Captain America is still my favourite Avenger, he's the lost relic from another time & he remains loyal & is the heart of the Avengers. This superb sequel really grabbed me & pulled me into this fantasy world with this amazing team of crime fighters, you really care for these characters & that's how well written they are & the world they exist in!!!

The chemistry between the Avengers team is great, playful & fun but full of heart, the team bounce off of each other, they became great friends & are a joy to watch together.

I found this fantastic sequel to be more grittier, Darker in tone & atmosphere & more heartfelt, there's a great depth to this story & it's characters, the script is superb it's fantastic writing. Each Avenger is given plenty of room to shine & really grow as a character especially Natasha (Black Widow) She is excellent & really shines as one of the greatest & bravest of the team!!! A fantastic performance from Scarlett Johansson, also Hawkeye is given alot more depth to his own story, we find out he has a pregnant wife & two kids, there's a warm touching scene where the Avengers hide out at his big country house & meet his family. There's so many great character moments & stunning action scenes. The great Jeremy Renner steals the show as Hawkeye for me, a great character that gets more screen time in this sequel. The Nightmare scenes that each Avenger suffers after the witch plays with their minds is so well done it plays out like a Horror movie, very creepy & dark scenes. Ultron is a Terrifying villain, an Artificial intelligence nightmare robot who creates an army of deadly robots to destroy earth, he's genuinely creepy & very menacing, a much better villain than Loki in my opinion.

The directing, the music, the acting, the action & the characters are all done perfectly. Probably the best Avengers film in my opinion & one of the greatest comic book films ever MADE!!!",7
"Man, people RELAX",11 June 2020,"So many of you (even ""so called"" Avenger fans) seemed to play down this episode on the Avengers saga.

Why watching 'Avengers: Age of Ultron' is important?,24 April 2015,"First of all because it's AWESOME.! The 142mins of the movie is not only packed with some great metal-bashing action scenes, its also gives a deeper view of personalities of our heroes. The inner-conflicts,self-realizations and the mind play that the Avengers suffer from,those wrong decisions made gets us to know them as Humans, than Gods. Coming back, the fighting scenes will make you clap so hard and shout (in excitement) so loud, that you'll never forget the experience ever.

Joss Whedon, You're the MAN.

Secondly,Avengers 2 has introduced a few new characters that will surely play a crucial role in the sequels to come. P.S.- These ones are so cool, you might end up replacing your favorites.

Thirdly, the movie gives a glimpse of the power of the Infinity Stones and will answer many questions that were raised in the previous films.

Fourthly, the new bonding between our avengers, there team play against the enemy they created. The fights and the new found love chemistry will keep you staring at the screen. P.S.- If you don't want to regret the rest of your life, go and watch the movie in 3D. Cause a flat screen is not much for Hulk and Hulk-Buster together.

Finally, the drama. The movie is all about the sacrifices our heroes go through. You might not like the way it ends,but hey,sometimes the god bleed too.

Conclusion: After you watch it, you 'll watch it again and again and again and again...",8
Very disappointed!,29 June 2022,,7
A Perfect Sequel From The Same Genius Director,29 April 2015,"This film is epic just like the first one, the same fine elements, a fluid storyline built from a complex series of events and characters. A great battle followed by an existential and human situation, and so on. Even we all know the characters too well, the director takes on the challenge to make them interesting in other ways involving a bizarre and megalomaniac guy like Ultron. I can watch this movie many times and still find new details that makes it charming. Congratulations to Joss Whedon and it's sad to know he has left The Avengers future projects. If you want action, extreme battle scenes, a good taste of superhero humor, some romance, meet new marvel characters and enjoy a boost of imagination, this is the film right for you and your kids.",10
The Avengers Letdown,31 July 2022,"After that amazing crossover event from The Avengers, what could go wrong with Avengers: Age of Ultron? The answer: way too much. This was just a boring movie. Some scenes were pretty great, but not enough to revive it. Joss Whedon has proven himself inadequate to be a director over and over, and this was no exception. While we did get a couple funny moments, and some great new characters, it just wasn't enough. They hit a couple characters way too low, and I'm still upset about it 7 years later. James Spader was a phenomenal Ultron, and I'd say that's the only standout character delivery. And it wasn't even bad acting for the rest, it was bad writing. In summary, I'd say this movie wasn't at all groundbreaking, and while it had its good moments, it's an okay watch if you want a movie to kill some time.",6
A redundant litany of comic book clichés.,18 July 2015,,1
Avengers: Age of Adequacy,13 July 2018,"A clear step-down from the first, 'Avengers: Age Of Ultron' is for the most part a mess. The characters aren't as well-written as the first, the pacing is poor, the story is pretty generic, and the film's action isn't even all that entertaining. On the flip side, the villain is unique, there are some good character moments and the inclusion of Scarlett Witch makes for some interesting scenes. However, these things can't elevate this film to more than 'good enough'. It's definitely not terrible and it's adequately made, but it just feels as if something is lacking to make us care more about the plot and characters. The film is certainly watchable, but it does nothing special to set it apart and therefore ends up being only a little more than average. There are worse superhero films out there, but considering that this is an 'Avengers' film, it can't help but feel like a let-down. 6/10",6

A derivative and dull follow-up that loses the focus on character and is ultimately just bland.,29 April 2018,"'Avengers: Age Of Ultron (2015)' is not the follow-up you, or director Joss Whedon, would expect and is honestly a derivative and dull experience clearly damaged by callous studio interference. This tampering transformed an already messy picture into a downright boring one. The character focus that made the first stand out, and that is key to the success of the best Marvel movies (as well as the best movies in general) is essentially gone, with each player practically caricatures of their former selves with weak motivations and barely any time or ability to convey them. The focus is placed almost entirely on the admittedly visually pleasing smashy-bashy finale that isn't as deserved this time and therefore isn't as compelling, being even more lifeless than the exposition sequences that will confuse even those who have seen all the prior titles. It's difficult to explain why at times I was just so bored, despite all that was unfolding on screen. And yet that is certainly the case, and the feeling just worsened with time to the point where I was tired upon the title's completion. The picture isn't terrible, it's certainly not among the worst even Marvel have to offer, but it is bland. 6/10",6
Excruciatingly bad!,28 April 2015,"The Draw! Well the first installment stringed together this rag-tag bunch and did a good job of it! Joss Whedon showed promise and there was a lot to look forward to! What we got to see! Definitely wasn't looking forward to this! This was a snooze-fest of the kind you wouldn't want to spend big bucks and time getting into theaters for! The plot is mashed up, convoluted and full of loopholes. The actors sleep through the whole episode giving you the impression they are performing from memory. The dialogues are stupid! Period! No one seemed to be interested in slowing this mess! It kept going on and on and on! Kevin Geige seems to have cooked more broth than he could handle this time. Like Thanos says as the end credits roll, ""Alright! I got to do this myself!"", someone needs to take the reins over from Whedon and Feige. The series is doomed! Disappointing is not the word to describe",1
Avengers: Age of Ultron,29 April 2019,,7
Avenging the Avengers,8 November 2015,"First off I'd like to say that I think the sequel to the first Avengers definitely lived up to my expectations. Yes the magic of seeing these characters together for the first time wasn't as dramatic but I will say that the team as a whole really functioned like a well oiled machine and everyone knew their role. This movie was flawed in areas and was not perfect but it still delivered as an entertaining Marvel adventure. The scale and scope was much grander in comparison to the first and I loved how they focused a bit more on the other Avengers who are not the main stay trinity of the group i.e.; Cap, Ironman, and Thor. Personally, Vision stole the show. His scenes were really cool and exciting and not to mention hes just awesome to look at. I thought James Spader hit it out of the park by giving Ultron some real gravitas. I also really like how they started to set the stage for Civil War. I believe that the films short comings will be forgiven and made up in Captain America 3. Overall Avengers Age of Ultron was highly entertaining and I don't think it deserves all the hate it has received. If you are a Marvel fan then this movie is for you.",10
Moving,26 August 2016,,7
A movie for all Ages,2 May 2015,"Avengers Age of Ultron is a surprisingly sophisticated, yet delivers the action and comedy you would expect from a Marvel movie. The movie starts with an incredible action sequence with slow motion kills, explosions, and comedy. This movie delivers laughs from start to finish, which separates this avengers from the last. After a jaw dropping action sequence the avengers find themselves in their new facility (Stark Industry). Where they soon encounter Ultron. Ultron is not your average villain. He is 100% AI, and the avengers are the only thing stopping him from world domination. The way he tries to defeat the avengers is turn them against each other. At this point the movie lacks something. The movie has all the great action sequences and jokes we were hoping for; but whatever that something they were missing was, they found it. The rest of the movie has the perfect combination of character development, action, and comedy that makes this one of the best films of the year.",9
Avengers,19 July 2020,"The role appears like a lantern, dazzled, but can not leave too deep an impression. There are too many characters in this film. Each of them has a dark history and paves the way for the future. Each role is very thin. Fortunately, there are many action scenes, and the opening long shot fight is not bad. I've seen it and I've seen it. There's no aftertaste. There is hardly a scene that makes people feel very hot-blooded.",7
Whedon's true mistake: Overestimating his audience.,7 May 2015,"Prior to watching the movie this is what I expected based on most review going on at the moment: Full of action, bad storytelling, something weird with Black Widow, and that Ultron was an unsatisfying villain. After watching the movie I can now add that most of what people are complaining about, why people are giving the movie very low scores, is highly over dramatized.

I would say to enjoy Age of Ultron at the level I did you must fill two prerequisites prior to seeing the movie. The first is that you have a decent foundation of the other Marvel MCU movies. You must have some knowledge of what went on in Iron Man 1, the first Avengers, the Winter Soldier, probably Thor 1, and possibly Guardians of the Galaxy. The movie is very quickly paced which I think left lots of viewers feeling lost, knowing these things before hand makes comprehending the plot much easier.

Second, you must be able to fill in the gaps. The movie packs on a ton of characters and weaves together many time-lines, it doesn't have time to explain Black Widow's infamous romance in the movie. It's true it hadn't been talked about before this movie but the writers presumed the audience would figure out that time had passed between Avengers 1 & 2 and actually they offer some lines that make it seem highly plausible. BUT YOU GOT TO PAY ATTENTION!

Other things they complained about: Ultron's inception, explained in plenty of detail. His plan, again explained in detail. Character motives, either alludes to previous movies or are explained.

Bottom line is the critics are mad because they don't understand, and they don't understand because they want to be spoon-fed all this information. Whedon is a clever writer who provided many lines and subplots that should have allowed viewers to understand the movie in better detail. In order to have done what critics wanted, the movie would have to have been much longer and it would have felt drawn out, and they would have hated it for that fact too.

Also another thing about this movie is that it is supposed to serve as a bridge to ""Phase 3"" of the MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe). What happens is it is supposed to leave open endings for the characters who will have later movies, to give them a direction to head in, to ultimately lead towards Infinity Wars. This is roughly the equivalent of the Harry Potter movies leading up to the war against Voldemort. A lot needs to be said and done before it can be made, Age of Ultron definitely sends them off in the direction they need to be.

It's either you catch the small things that were said to make sense of the movie, or you think it is all nonsensical. This turns out to be one that I'm confident critics are wrong about. Go to the movie, pay attention, enjoy the amazing action sequences, and understand its flaws resulted from necessity. 9/10 to combat the hate! :)",9
Special Effects Action,14 January 2019,"9 May 2015. Heavy on special effects and action and light on thoughtful, intelligence. There are the requisite twists and deaths and relational pairings. Ironman's dry humor continues to balance the onslaught of violence that echoes of Kill Bill Vol. No 1 (2003) and The Matrix Revolutions (2003). What's new and interesting is the slight advancement of 3-D imagery and the introduction of the creative ways of destroying things. There are few new characters that add a dash of freshness.

Overall, though there are a few dead zones, Ultron's actor's familiar voice can be a bit distracting and other then the action there doesn't seem to be much new or hugely interesting about this movie. Mostly creatively more of the same.",7
Just so much fun,17 August 2015,,9
Liked the first one more.....disappointed.,25 April 2015,"Lets start with all the good things, all the treats that this movie brought us because no doubts there are plenty of them. Stark tries to jump start a peacekeeping mission and something unexpected happened and now avengers have to deal with it.

Movie starts with a bang. Avengers are all set for a mission and they are jumping their and dodging this and all that and 'the twins' are introduced. Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver played by Elizabeth Olsen and Aaron Taylor Johnson respectively.

I must say this new addition is really exciting, not only in this movie, but i am waiting for more involvement of them in future avenger projects, despite of such an enormous star cast.

Now one by one let us talk about the director and the actors. Joss Whedon, he is a genius, or was, i don't know, all i know is i liked Firefly very much and this movie, i don't think it can compete with that, but what i was disappointed to see that as the movie proceeds it executes a very good story, also long, in a very easy going way. It does not have any of that charm that the first installment had. Also there are too many one liners, you know those sarcastic dialogues given to the actors (mostly to Downey Jr.) where they expect small laughs from the audience. I mean they were good in the first one but really used here over the limit. But no problem with the direction business. Its just when i hear Joss Whedon, i think of something that is perfect for me, this movie isn't.

Now Robert Downey Jr. is again in his best form, nobody can deny that when he is there, only he is there. The story around iron man is not so exciting though.

Chris Evan made an impression. There was a small portion about Captain America's past and his choices for his present, that i liked very much.

Mark Ruffalo seemed tired, mainly because he turned green for a long time in this movie, but his screen sharing with Scarlet Johansson was okay. Scarlet was sexy as always with some really great action moves.

Chris Hemsworth has some important part to play with which he did justice.

Jeremy Renner was really looking good when standing with all those superheroes, i mean in the first he was almost insignificant.

Elizabeth and Quicksilver were good, but their role was too small, they almost weren't looking that special, nor was Paul Bettany, i am a huge fan by the way, but seeing his suddenly appearing as a very important character felt forced.

The movie was good, i gave it 8 right, but the thing is i gave the previous Avengers a 9. I missed the thrill that was there all the time in that film, maybe because it was a new concept and now when this is a follow up, it isn't looking so exciting.",7

Avengers: Age of Ultron,2 August 2018,,7
Faster than a Catholic Rabbit,23 September 2015,"That's how fast Ultron multiplies himself, according to one character.

There is one thing to say about these Avengers and Avengers-Related films of late, they are stuffed full of ""Transformers Dark of the Moon"" style creatures and robots attacking large populations. Ie: Huge CGI Sequences showing the utter destruction of various cities, as if Tokyo is everywhere and can be rebuilt quickly.

But in this case, the story closely matches the Comic Books from whence it came. If you watch this without first watching the Iron Man films, the Thor Films, the Captain America films, and even Guardians of the Galaxy, you will be lost in a barren wasteland of references to something called ""The Infinity Stones"".

It is the one thread that connects all of these films, it was introduced in Captain America: The First Avenger, and it showed up in some form in Thor and Thor: The Dark World.

In fact, the one particular Infinity Stone gave Loki his power to brainwash Hawkeye and Dr Selvig. But we didn't know this in the first Avengers film.

The nature of this particular stone is what ultimately causes the creation of one of my favorite Avengers: The Vision. The Vision! I don't know if The Vision's creation follows the way it was done in the books, I never read the Ultron storyline. I suppose they had to change some aspects of it, like they did with the Extremis storyline in Iron Man 3- But even that is related.

I have never read any Marvel comic without having to buy several other titles just to follow a particular story, in was bankrupting me, I had to stop collecting. I'll have to find the Trade Paperback/Graphic Novel of this to compare the story elements.

But I think my disappointment is that people forget that these movies are extensions of those original Comics. They are filmed that way, to look like a comic book, and there is no other way to tell the stories. Every Avengers story eventually includes a huge battle over a city, a planet, in space, etc- This film has several large battle sequences even before the final climactic fight. They get sequentially more complex until the final one, it's not just a fight, there is a city floating in the sky, there are hundreds of Ultron Droids, and there are too many bullets flying around for even Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor-Johnson, who plays the exact same kind of guy in Days of Future Past) to avoid. I was totally shocked by Elizabeth Olson, who I did not like much in ""Godzilla"", she totally got the Scarlet Witch, and she gave her to us. The way she is, what she can do, that's straight from the Comics. One worm can that was not toppled was that ""The Twins"" are in fact Magneto's Kids. They don't mention much about the part of Wanda's power that is due to causing freak accidents to happen, she is an ""Improbability Engine"" (It's on the back of one of my X-Men Trading Cards).

One thing that was great was a party on the Avengers NYC Mansion, which we saw at the end of the first Avengers film. But it was crashed by Dr Daniel Jackson of Stargate, oops, by Ultron! I recognized James Spader's voice almost immediately, because it sounded very much like that character from the Stargate movie and the TV shows. Ironically, the actor in the TV versions uses the exact same voice. It was genius casting, gave Ultron a lot of Depth.

What Else? Oh Yah, in the Comics, Hawkeye was married to another Avenger, I think who got killed off. That's one thing that's different with Jeremy Renner's Hawkeye.

But as I watch these Avengers flicks and the other related Marvel Universe films, it appears that not only are The Avengers being Assembled, but the entire Marvel Multiverse! From X-Men to Avengers, from Thor to Iron Man, these franchises are making mine Marvel just like the comic books did when I was younger.

Nuff Said? Nuff Said!",10
Not great but still good!,27 April 2015,"Can't say its better than The Avengers (2012) but it's still a good entertaining film. What The Avengers (2012) lacked is ridiculously compensated in Age of Ultron, unfortunately at the expense of what made the first one a better and more complete film. Some might feel that the second act in The Avengers was a bit slow but in my opinion, it is moments like these that made the third act all the more fulfilling. Age of Ultron lacked that bit in my opinion. It was all one flashy action set piece after another with very little built up or back story. Without a slower second act to built up some tension and drama, the whole movie does feel a bit flat in the end.

Having said that, the movie does feel like there was originally a bit more to it than what was released. You can't help but feel that chunks of the movie were taken out to reduce the run time. That feeling when you see a scene transitioning into another and go, ""Wait hang on, did they just skipped a page?!""

To sum it up, it feels like a Transformers movie that was done right. A insane amount of non-stop action with tons of funny one- liners thrown in the mix with very little build up.",7
A good film - but not a great one.,27 April 2015,,8
Meh,29 January 2022,,6
If I were to say anything bad about the film it would just be petty,27 April 2015,"Obviously there will always be 'haters' (I hate that term) but I think you need to be a picky person in order to give this film a bad review. Yes I am a marvel fan, but honestly if I had to say any bad things about the film they would be really petty. For me it was a great addition to the marvel universe and ultron will certainly be iconic... He is a scary balance of humour, sociopathic tendencies and melodramatic evil that you need to have an icon and favourable villain.. James Spader was the perfect choice for the role.

End credits was fine, didn't blow me away, it was kind of expected but there has been so much speculation as to what it would be with the huge roster of films to come that what I could have hoped for would have been unrealistic

Wheaton did well to give more screen time to characters who had possibly been neglected and the new additions added to the spectacle. I'm interested to see how they will develop. However I think once than anything this film just makes me so much more excited for civil war.

Overall, The Avengers: Age of Ultron is more likely to stand the test of time in comparison to its predecessor... It was funnier and it had some moments where, as a marvel fan I was going ""wow"" or laughing in mixed emotions of ecstasy at the various Easter eggs and fan fulfilment. Also, this film has a darker tone in comparison to most marvel films which gives an extra layer to what has admittedly becoming a repetitive formula which was a rather liberating experience.",10
Avengers are back with a bang...Narration Disappoints a bit.,26 April 2015,,7
"The movie brings exactly what you expect, and more.",10 May 2015,"Not only does Avengers: Age of Ultron succeed at being a great follow up to its predecessor, it also manages to improve on the original. Avengers: Age of Ultron is deeper and darker than Marvel's The Avengers, giving more humanity to the main characters while also lacking boredom. This sequel manages to be faster and more evenly distributed than the original in terms of tone. In the first movie, the first half is pure dialog and the second half is just pure action, making the first 45 minutes feel kind of stale. In Age of Ultron, the dialog and action are more consistent throughout, making it more entertaining. Althoguh the motivation and arc of this movie's villain feels rushed, he is still a ton of fun to watch James Spader completely own the role as the evil Ultron. This movie takes the weakest character from the first Avengers film and gives him a heartwarming backstory and makes him one of the film's best characters. Overall, Avengers: Age of Ultron is just what you wanted plus a little extra.",9
Age of Ultron- forget about Ultron,11 May 2015,,2
Flawed but enjoyable,23 April 2022,"Despite all of the films faults (and yes, there are a decent amount of them...) this is still a fun and enjoyable sequel to The Avengers and you won't feel like you've wasted your time.",7
Many of these reviews don't do this film justice,2 May 2015,"I read the reviews last night and so many were so negative and I thought about passing on it. I posted on FB and several people said they loved it and go see it. I'm 51 but I love these films and not an wide eyed 13 yr old. I really can't see how anyone is a fan of these types of movies not liking this, it was from start to finish pure awesomeness. I absolutely loved the 1st and I think this was even better. The back stories on the characters totally fleshed them out more and made them human.People were complaining about them saving the world again, Hello??? it's a comic book movie. I'm telling you if I missed this in the theaters and saw it at home, I would have been irate. Go see it in the theater.",9
Lackluster sequel,15 January 2019,"Once again, Earth faces an existential threat and all that stands between us and extinction are 'Earth's Mightiest Heroes'. This time we hapless humans are faced with 'Ultron', the verbose metal-manifestation of Tony Stark's software solution to world-peace gone rogue. Lacking the spark and cleverness of the first Avengers film, this sequel covers much the same ground, as the team squabbles amongst themselves, then come together when they are needed most. The usual superhuman crew (introduced in solo films or the first entry in the franchise) are opposed/joined by a couple of Eastern European meta-humans (complete with Boris and Natasha accents), 'Red Witch' and her brother 'Quicksilver'. Elizabeth Olsen looks great as the telekinetic Red Witch but her abilities are so vaguely powerful that it's hard to imagine why she alone can't solve most of the problems. Also new on the scene is 'Vision' (also vaguely all-powerful), in whom is embedded one of the MacGuffins around which next film in the franchise circles ('the excellent ""Infinity Wars"", 2018). 'Age of Ultron' is a step down from the first Avengers film: the story is illogical (see goofs section) yet predictable, the script weaker (especially the endless (and sometimes incongruous) ""lighthearted"" banter between the übermensch), and the villain more irritating than menacing. The special effects are pretty good (although the film opens with a gamey-looking battle between the team and Hydra minions), as is the acting (considering the genre). While I got a little tired of Tony Stark's incessant 'droll egotist' shtick, it does play well against Steve Roger's 'greatest generation' decency and Thor's demigod literalness, and Mark Ruffalo is excellent as Bruce Banner/The Hulk, the ultimate in ego/id incompatibility. The pacing of the film is a bit off, especially the prolonged layover in Hawkeye's Norman Rockwellesque farmhouse (and why you would use your family's home as a 'safe house' when at war with a near-omniscient foe is beyond me). All in all: OK as a segue in the 'Infinity Stones' story arc but a bit weak as a standalone feature.",7
"If Your IQ Is Above Average, You Will See This Film as Superior To First Avengers",3 May 2015,"Also, if you have attention deficit disorder, you will like the first Avengers better. However, if you like a deeper and darker story line, and you do not have an attention deficit disorder and have an above average IQ, you will like this film.. Here are the reasons;

1. Better character fleshing - In the fist Avengers, we had characters come together to stop a basically mindless plot by Loki to rule The Earth. Character motivations had little to no fleshing. Here, we have each character's motivation as an Avenger delved into much deeper, and in a much more realistic and human way. (I.E, Banner and Romanov motivation and interaction here, it does make a ton of sense and it's not forced if you understand the character motivation)

2. Better antagonist motivation -- Ultron's motives make sense. In some ways it's not hard to actually agree with his agenda, which makes him a much better and threatening antagonist than Loki, who I found to be a sniveling childish punk in the first film. Ultron has a mission, and as artificial intelligence his point of view is to evolve beyond that of a simple program, and has the freedom to interpret what it means to ""bring peace."" I really liked this angle much better than Loki and his boorish childish ego. In fact, Ultron reminded me very much of the Agent Smith character from The Matrix trilogy; very similar point of view and mindset which to me makes Ultron far more menacing and interesting - it's not a stretch to actually see his point of view and actually agree with it in many ways.

3. Better/deeper dialog -- Do not believe other reviewers when they harp on the cheesy one-liners. They fit in decently here, not out of place like in the last Transformers film for an example. Occasionally, a few do seem forced, but in no way do they subtract from the much more tied-in and serious undertone this film has over its predecessor. Additionally, this film fleshes out Tony Stark in a way only the first Iron Man was able to accomplish. One weakness I did find was the Steve Rogers character taking a small step backwards in this regard. However, Banner, Romanov, Hawkeye and Stark characterizations move forward while Thor remains consistent.

A great new addition is ""The Vision"" (Thor's Vision) who is basically AI come into genetic life, and is a cross between Jarvis and Ultron. (The Vision is ""worthy!"") The end of the film fleshes him out properly where he converses with Ultron and points out the differences between the 2 AI's.

Now, if you want mindless action, which is how I saw the first Avengers as; the kind of mindlessness that does not require you to actually pay attention and enjoy the greater overall depth here, you probably will not like this film, and may even find yourself confused by it. This seems to me to be the tone of the negative reviews for this title.

In my view, this film ties up and transitions the Marvel Universe in a most efficient way, (except for the single mid-credit appearance, which is basically a do-over) which should make the next chapter, ""Captain America, Civil War"" (Ant-man is a separate slice of pie for now) a smooth transition. Note that the first Avengers film did not do that (Thanos end credit, poor continuity into Thor-Dark World.)

Conclusion - If you like a deeper story line with an antagonist who is similar to The Matrix's Agent Smith, (this film has a bit of a Matrix feel) and like your brain fed along with top-notch action, This Avengers film will be a far better experience for you than the first one. However, if you like your Marvel action spoon-fed with little to no thinking required, you may not like this one and certainly will not like it better than the first Avengers - you may even give it a negative review.",9
Marvel Cinematic Universe Marathon 2019 #13,20 December 2021,"First of all, it's nice to see Joss Whedon choose to go with the 2.39:1 format instead of his usual 1.85:1 aspect ratio.

Avengers: Age of Ultron is a decent get-together film with lots of fun and action. But it's fast pacing script and convulated plot doesn't add up to the equation of The Avengers formula.

James Spader makes a good villain, as well. Don't look too closely at the plot, though, or you'll see plenty of holes. Plus, when you have so many jokes in a movie, some are bound to miss.

When the sentient Ultron makes plans to wipe out the human race, they and the rest of the Avengers, a team of superheroes, set out to stop him. This is a noisy, compact actioner with a baffling plot but engaging for its interesting notions of predestination and about scientists going too far with their knowledge. Robert Downey Jr's mousetrap fast witty repartee is amusing and there is good support from the likes of Paul Bettany. Those unacquainted with the film series will not get its full effect from the limited backstory. The Avengers' disposing of their foes looks like tossing garbage in the bin rather than proper fight sequences to engage with. World saving is also a well trodden storyline, but most of the film's budget (the second highest in film history at the time) is up on the screen with wonderful special effects to marvel.",6

The Avengers Reunite to Face Ultron's Wrath in 'The Age of Ultron',22 April 2023,,6
Marvel continues to amaze us,18 May 2015,"Age of Ultron beautifully captures the essence of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It helps Joss Whedon reiterate why people should watch movies that are a part of the MCU.

Age of Ultron is one film where everything comes together. Almost all loose ends from the Phase 2 films are brought together and it is knitted really nicely. Despite all the hate it is receiving from a lot of people about it not being a dark film, I think it's nice that it's not dark. The Avengers are these super-cool heroes with a lot of bonding with each other and coordination. Joss made sure that AoU lived up to that and the CGI he put in to complement that is just MARVELous.

The film gives insight into a lot of the topics that were left unexplored in the previous films and all the subplots do nothing but build on the characters very nicely (as opposed to what the usual reviews say). Obviously we do not get the thrill of seeing these characters get together for the first time ever and the small little differences that it creates and obviously the bar set by The Avengers (2012) was really high, Age of Ultron offers to show us how these characters have grown to like/dislike each other. It explores their deepened chemistry and yes, if not surpassing the bar set by the first film, it does meet it.

With a moral meaning hidden in the movie, with a lot of depth to justify the heroes' actions and kick-ass one-liners which tickled everyone's ribs, Age of Ultron is a masterpiece and I do hope that the follow-up Captain America Civil War lives up to the standards set by this movie.",10
"Definitely Satisfying, but Feels the Same",2 May 2015,"Having just got out of seeing Avengers: Age of Ultron, let me start by saying that I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. The action is definitely there and some shots look right off the pages of the comic book, which was great. Having said that, this movie has a few problems that have been recurring through many Marvel movies.

PROS: Let's start with the good parts. As mentioned before, the action is there and should suffice for most of the viewers. To continue, Ultron is probably the best villain so far in the MCU, and he is brilliantly portrayed visually and by the voice work of James Spader. As usual, the Avengers themselves are all great and each get some spotlight, especially Hawkeye. This was probably my favorite part of the movie. Before, Hawkeye was kinda just there and was out- shined by most of the other heroes. This sequel expands greatly on Hawkeye's arc and it was very touching. Also, Vision was used magnificently here and was easily one of the highlights of the entire movie. Lastly, the comedy is there as well with a bunch of little quips from everyone throughout many scenes. The chemistry of all the actors greatly adds to the comedy and brings on more laughs.

CONS: While some of my problems are that the film feels very similar to its predecessor and that it needed to set up future MCU movies, most of my problems coincide with the positives. To start, the comedy, it worked at some parts, but at others it just felt out of place. At some points the movie was trying to show a more serious and darker tone, but then threw in a one-liner. Next is a recurring problem and my biggest problem with the movie. The fact that I never feel any threat of danger for any of the characters made it harder for me to be completely enthralled by the action scenes. I've had the same problem since the first Avengers came out. In my opinion, the only Marvel movie to show any threat or consequences for the characters was Captain America: Winter Soldier, but I digress. My last complaint is that some parts felt a little rushed, namely, the beginnings of Ultron.

Overall, while watching this movie, the positives outweighed the negatives for this movie and it made me greatly excited for the next films to come. While some parts may be a bit overblown and stuffed, Avengers: Age of Ultron met my high expectations and brought me a highly enjoyable sequel that is definitely worth at least a couple more viewings.

Overall Score: 8.75/10",6
Worth to see,11 May 2015,,8
Avenger age of Ultron is a great film but not perfect,25 April 2015,,7
The Age Of Ultron,27 May 2016,"Joss Whedon returns to write and direct 2015's ""Avengers: Age of Ultron,"" which is not in any way related to the critically acclaimed Marvel Comics comic book series ""Age of Ultron"" by Brian Michael Bendis, Bryan Hitch, Brandon Peterson, and Carlos Pacheco - except, of course, for the title ""Age of ""Ultron."" (As a side-note, I read this series before I ever saw the movie, which has a completely different story-line from Whedon's film.)

""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" takes place three years after ""The Avengers"" (2012), in which the Avengers team of super-powered heroes - Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey, Jr.), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Dr. Bruce Banner/The Incredible Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans), Natasha Romanoff/The Black Widow (Scarlet Johansson), and Clint Barton/Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) - must Re-Assemble to combat Ultron (voiced by James Spader), a rogue artificial intelligence that was created by Tony Stark and Dr. Bruce Banner in a good-willed, if mistaken, attempt to protect the Earth from all threats, human and extraterrestrial, and to create a world where the Avengers are no longer needed.

Of course, and in what is perhaps Marvel's attempt to one-up the similarly-themed ""Terminator"" franchise, Ultron - Marvel's version of Terminator's Skynet - comes to view humanity as a threat, and that the only way to truly achieve peace is to eliminate all human beings. So the Avengers, with newcomers, and twin mutants - Pietro Maximoff/Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and his sister Wanda Maximoff/Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) - go to work to try to stop the ego-maniacal and quickly evolving Ultron before it destroys all of humanity. (In another side-note, it is worth mentioning that the pairing of Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen here as siblings is really interesting since just one year before, they played husband and wife in 2014's ""Godzilla."")

""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" is a superior sequel to ""The Avengers."" I've waited a year to see this movie and it didn't disappoint (much). I don't need to talk about the other performers because we've grown so accustomed to them already and we know who they are. And although strong supporting characters such as James Rhodes/War Machine (Don Cheadle) and Sam Wilson/The Falcon (Anthony Mackie) make small appearances here & there, the real star here (and the real reason to see this movie, period), for me, was the truly awesome James Spader as Ultron.

It is well-known that in the original comics, Ultron was actually the creation of Dr. Henry ""Hank"" Pym/Ant-Man/Giant-Man, and the maniacal robot harbored a murderous personal grudge against its creator in a bizarre twist on the so-called ""Oedipus Complex""; but here, he was created by Tony Stark and Dr. Bruce Banner. Ultron is also one of the greatest comic book villains of all time, and one of the few non-human characters to take that mantle. So although Spader himself never appears on-screen, he was quite menacing as Ultron, and with just his distinct voice alone, he was able to make Ultron a truly formidable adversary to the Avengers, with a darkly humorous personality to boot. His portrayal of this psychopathic robot from Hell is one of the better portrayals of superhero-movie villainy in recent years.

""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" was an exciting and action-packed entry into the Marvel Cinematic Universe - which, of course, was one of the principal titles that would set up this year's ""Captain America: Civil War"" (2016).

Avengers age of Ultron,7 June 2020,"I can't say the film didn't lack action because it didn't, every minute was filled with brilliant effects and amazing shots. An action packed adrenaline ride all through. However this said the film lacked story. At first the film was taking over from the first avengers, the story was good. But somewhere into the film the story fell apart with too much happening and without the solid story line it felt weak, with no real connections at all there was just fighting and action all over. I thought from what little story this film had to offer it was a lot more comic based than the previous one. The main villain in this film felt like a weakly based character, he had little to do with the story and was probably a contributing factor into it's downfall.

In conclusion I thought that the action, acting and effects are among the best, however the weak story left me with a far different feeling to the first. I thought although this film was great for a sequel it wasn't as good as the first. The film felt like it was meant to put a story across ready for the next film, which I hope will have a better story and live up to my expectations! However if for now you're looking for a great action film this is definitely a great one to watch, even though the story was weak and lacked that edge it is still a great film and hopefully will make an even better trilogy!",7

My Review!,29 August 2019,"The movie is great for people who've a bit of experience of it's early cartoon characters. I tried explaining a few things to a few but then I was just sounding stupid. For people who haven't watched the cartoon series, don't let my comment on the same turn you off. The graphics are a kicker, the character's have played well, all round, great work. Worth a watch. I might watch it again.

P.S: Personally, I liked Avengers (film) 1 more.

They made some characters stupid so that they could argue.,19 December 2019,"I have loved almost every MCU movie. Civil War and Age of Ultron are two blemishes on the stretch of great movies for me though. I liked all three Thors, all of Cap's, both of GOTG, both Ant-mans, all of the Spider-mans including Far From Home, and I even enjoyed all of the Iron Mans. I know lots of people disliked Iron Man two and three, a lot disliked Thor Dark World, and a lot disliked GOTG 2. I liked them all myself. However the bickering and blame game drama of Civil War and Ultron just contaminated those two movies for me a bit too much.

I saw this way back in 2015. I remember how I was just annoyed how they dumbed down the characters just to make them argue. It just infuriated me that they were all just bickering with each other and being idiots. Not the heroes I wanted to see. A bunch of blame game out-of-character nonsense. What is worse is that the arguments weren't even rational. It is like they just needed to create some fake drama filler as if this were a stupid reality tv show.

I also recall feeling that they didn't completely make the villain make sense. His intent for the reason said was just illogical. That angered me as well.

There WERE lots of GOOD things in this movie, but I'm keeping it at just six out of ten because these negatives really weighed on my mind throughout the movie. For the plot itself to be compromised...dang it really bummed me out. I do advise watching it if you are going to watch Infinity War or Endgame. There are some good things in these Ultron and Civil War that I am glad I didn't miss out on.",6
A solid second outing for everyone's favorite superhero team,10 September 2015,"When crafting a sequel to any movie, the goal is usually to make it bigger while still retaining the qualities that made people fall in love with the first one. On that alone, AVENGERS: AGE OF ULTRON succeeds marvelously. While the action in THE AVENGERS was mostly confined to New York (at least the climax), ULTRON is more of a globe-hopping adventure. The banter between the team members is as funny as ever and, without the need to bring the team together this time, there was more time allotted to character development, particularly Hawkeye and Black Widow, who haven't had so much to do in the Marvel movies up to this point. Of course, with this expansion comes a handful of new characters to add to all the ones we're familiar with (and most of whom at least make a cameo). Chief among these is Ultron, a sneering villain whose personality is directly based on Stark's. There are also the twins, Pietro and Wanda Maximoff, who have a particular connection with Stark that sees them initially aligned with Ultron against the Avengers. To sum up all that's good with the film is quite easy: it's frickin' cool. A slightly more polished way to put this is that it delivers on the all of the witty repartee and CGI-enhanced action that we've come to expect from the MCU. However, there are a few points where it doesn't quite live up to its predecessor. First, the novelty of having the team together has worn off a bit. Second, while the increase in locations is appreciated, the narrative is somewhat more splintered and unwieldy than it possibly should have been. A lot of this has to do with some scenes which are setting up future adventures. Another big part of this has to do with the final action set-piece basically being a redux of the Battle of New York from the first AVENGERS. And, while Ultron is great as the villain always ready with a quip, his motivation remained as opaque and vague as Scarlet Witch's powers (summed up as ""weird""). It boils down to not being as streamlined nor as unique as what came before it. Still, none of this really negatively impacted my enjoyment. I was as eager to return to this world as anyone, and Joss Whedon surely didn't disappoint me.",8
More of a hit than a miss!,28 April 2015,,8
It was Great at the Beginning and the Middle but that Ending WTH!,6 May 2020,"Ultron had a Great Introduction, and the same with Vision but that Climax with Ultron was so Lacklustre.

Quicksilver and Scarlett Witch were Great in this.

That City in the Sky was Amazing to watch.",7
Avengers PLEASE keep assembling!,25 April 2015,"The visual effects in the film were phenomenal, there was a minute or so at the beginning that felt a little off, but I think that was just me. After that the battle scenes were amazing, in my opinion second to none in comic films, it was as beautiful to watch as the action in say ""Edge Of Tomorrow"". There was some scenes that seem so flawlessly made that they could easily pull off being real life events. Stand out effects for me was the Hulkbuster and Ultron, both were amazing to see, especially Ultron the range of emotions shown by a completely robotic humanoid made the character that extra bit disturbing.

As for the characters and cast, which at this point due to longevity have become one in the same really, by that I mean when I think about the characters I envision them as their live action selves and no longer their comic looks. All the returning cast are as good as they have been in previous instalments, except for Jeremy Renner, he was outstanding in his role as Clint he was really given the freedom to actually show emotion and his range as an actor. Was great to see him able to flex his acting chops, which I will be honest I was not sure he had. The biggest additions to the cast are Paul Bettany as Vision who was brilliant in what he done, but didn't have to do much due to being an emotionless android, Aaron Taylor-Johnson as Pietro Maximoff/Quicksilver his acting is as expected personally I find him to be a good actor who is really honing his skills in recent years, while his accent falters at times, it is a hard accent to pull off I find. Then we have Elizabeth Olsen as Wanda Maximoff/Scarlett Witch, another extremely talented actress in my opinion, she was brilliant in this too, especially in the more emotionally driven scenes then we have James Spader as Ultron the most ominous audible villain I have heard in a LONG time, his voice just oozed evil and dominance I can say I finally understand the hype around his ability.

The action starts at an 11 in this film and only gets better, that's not to say that the story or characters miss out. The film has a solid story to it, but even more so, has some wonderful character development, you get to see sides of some characters we have not yet seen in the MCU. Really shapes up some big moments for the future of the franchise, some great moments, some gut wrenching, all together mashed into a brilliant story and progression to characters we all know and love.

The runtime does seem long beforehand, however, there is enough going on at every turn that you kind of forget how long you have been watching and that is a good thing. It's a 141 minute ride that doesn't feel as long as others that run this time.

Overall, I'd go as far as to say this is the best film in the MCU to date in my opinion, which I never thought I'd say due to my dying love for Avengers and Captain America The Winter Soldier. The film was an emotional ride from start to finish, filled with action, ass kicking, hilarious lines and character development second to none in the current MCU crop. If you are not currently into the whole superhero explosion we have had in recent years, I highly recommend starting with this or Captain America The Winter Soldier they perfectly personify the superhero world but also serve as ""everyday"" films if you will. Very happy to say Mr Joss Whedon goes out with a bang and certainly not a whimper, I'm already longing for the day he returns to the MCU in the future. I had extremely high expectations going into the film, came out with them shattered and then some, roll on Ant-Man!",10
Disappointment,17 November 2018,,7
An entertaining sequel which doesn't quite live up to the original,16 May 2015,"Avengers: Age Of Ultron is an exciting sequel to the 2012 movie even though it doesn't quite live up to the original.

The plot is that Tony Stark and Bruce Banner accidentally create an AI called Ultron. He says that he wants to save the world but his idea of saving means destroying the world so the team has to get together and stop him.

Firstly, this is not a bad movie. I liked it a lot. Each character gets their chance to shine and the action scenes are magnificent. The final battle is epic and entertaining. The movie is computer animated but it didn't bother me at all. Also, a particular character's death scene near the end is unexpected and sad.

But I had a huge issue with the movie's comedy. Marvel sometimes puts one-liners and comedy relief in. Sometimes it works but other times it doesn't. The movie has a lot of one-liners and I found most of them not to be funny. Also, some of them felt really out of place. They would be in battle fighting for their lives and some of them would just be making jokes desensitizing the viewer to any impending fear of death in battle. If the characters seem so relaxed then what suspense is needed to be held by the audience. It feels really out of place.

Also, I had an issue with the script. I don't want to say too much because I want to keep this review spoiler free. But I will say that it feels very rushed and unorganized. There are a few completely unnecessary side plots. There are also some useless characters that could've been removed because they really don't impact the story overall. Also, the villain was a massive letdown in Marvel's growing pile of mishandled super villains.

In conclusion, this movie has positives. If you like cgi action scenes then you'll enjoy this because the movie handles the special effects nicely. But if you were looking for a deep story which the trailer promised then you'll be massively disappointed.",4
Wish they failed in the end,29 May 2016,"This movie has its flaws as with any superhero movie. I however enjoyed this one more so than Avengers (2012). The action was tighter and more swift. The story however was nothing new, but very engaging dealing with an AI that goes rogue and watching the seeds of disassembling take root among the Avengers. The characterization is some of the best I have seen of any superhero movie.

Now the bone I have with this movie is that it doesn't take the risk in showing the reality that failure can happen. The ending for this movie presented the Avengers with an impossible situation that involved either saving the human race at the expense of a failed state or allow the extinction of humanity. This was a pivotal moment in superhero era where the superhero will have to face a disastrous situation the Avengers and the world would never recover from. Instead we get a generic ending and the Avengers once again saving the day. We could have gotten a movie where the superheroes fail. That's what I was hoping to see as that would not only change the dynamics of the Avengers, but the dynamics of superhero movies to come.

Ultron was great but I was hoping for more use out of him in how he affects the world structure. When it says Age of Ultron I thought Ultron was going to revolutionize the world. I was hoping for world implications of his existence nothing short of economic catastrophe, internet shutdown, launch of nuclear weapons codes, wars, massive human loss, and of course the murder of the human race at the hands of Ultron a la robotic army.

AOU is worth the time and is still a fun ride. Just hoped that the Avengers failed this time around.",7
Gust stunning,27 April 2015,"This is one of the best movies I have watched.It have eventing drama,action,comedy at the same time.The effects are marbles and stunning.All my expectations became true.Some will say that there isn't any good actors in the movie and there is gust effects but for the mass public it is one of the best Marvel movies yet.Some critics will say that it gust another fantasy and animated movie of Marvel but i cant imagine some one ho wont like this movie.One time you are watching very carefully to catch the story line and the suddenly they say something and start laughing so much that its hard to watch and after that there is a very powerful scene with drama or some crazy action.",10

The MCU (So Far) Ranked: 16,10 April 2019,"T took me a long time to come to terms with the fact that this movie is just ok.

Avengers: Age of Ultron should be so much better than it is but it ended up being the poster child for when a studio gets cold feet and tries to take over on directors vision. Joss Whedon is an excellent story teller but this does not so off his talents at all. Once again this certainly isn't a bad film it just isn't great, there is some good dialogue and the introduction of both Scarlet Witch and Vision is worth seeing.",6
Avengers: Age of Ultron,25 April 2015,"This is a movie I've been waiting months to see. I'm a big Marvel Comics and movie fan. The first outing for this ensemble of super characters, The Avengers is one of my all time favourites. So, really looking forward to this movie but filled with trepidation: what If it didn't live up to the hype, how many sequels are as good as the first, what if it was just downright disappointing? So the first question to ask is ""where you disappointed""? Heck no, this is one well crafted, superhero, super fun, super sequel. Whew, I'm telling you I was worried going into the cinema but from minute one, this movie takes you on a roller coaster of action, fun, super-amazing CGI, great characters and a well thought out story. Even has a few laughs thrown in for good measure.

The story at its heart is a simple one: good people, modern day Knights in shining armour, okay more latex than armour but go with the flow. With warrior hearts that have to do battle with evil; finding the resolve and character to fight against the odds to claim victory for good. It's good vs evil, that simple. Of course the good guys all have super powers, okay, technically Tony Stark doesn't have super powers out with his Iron Man suit but go with me on the premise, all the good guys are super good and of course the bad guys are super bad. Except that in this movie the bad guy ain't quite ""guy"" but I'll say no more and let you figure out what I mean for yourselves. The story has many layers of sudo science and the CGI adds to the sci-fi dimension of the tale, but hey it's a Marvel Comics adaptation, of course it's going to have sudo science and sci-fi in it. It may be a sci-fi movie with lots of special effects but it's also got lots of great characters, many of which are not human but they've all got depth and are all very human. It's an old story rebooted for a modern technological age; even plagiarises ever so gently from Beauty and The Beast on a side strand!

The characters all work well together, you get the feeling that the actors had fun working together. Great performances from the whole cast, it would be unfair to pick out any individual actor, no one tries to out act the others they all work well together. They had fun working with each other and they bring fun to the movie. The movie has a lot of humour, okay, some of the humour is geeky, but hey let's be honest, you don't go to see a Marvel superhero movie without having a little bit of geek in you! The end result is that the characters they are acting on the screen all bond well together; it's an ensemble of all, a team of talent. They are The Avengers.",10
Not the biggest fan,18 January 2019,"The main plot never really convinced me. The basic idea had potential, even if it doesn't sound too original. The way they executed it - mediocre ?!

Had also good parts that I enjoyed, some of the slower paced ones for example and obviously production and CGI are on point as always.

So, if I am not a big fan, why still 7/10 ? It's an MCU movie after all, it's by default decent. Arguing about everything else is being nitpicky.",7
"Maybe some, including myself, just suffer the ""First Viewing"" Effect (Movie is really awesome though)",27 April 2015,"(This is the first time that I wrote a review for a movie here in IMDb. Maybe I have to share this because I think I suffered the ""first viewing"" effect and I admit that I doubt that it was a good movie after I left the cinema the first time I have watched it. However, I think my disappointment resulted from my own fault. This, maybe, happened to some. Maybe not. I wrote this also because I find that the movie doesn't deserve so much hate that it tend to affect negatively those who haven't watched the movie yet.)

After watching it again, I have told myself, ""It is awesome after all. Why have I hated it before?""

I have realized some possible reasons: 1. EXPECTATIONS.I am a cinephile. I also love Marvel Movies. I am waiting for this movie for a long time. Whenever I became aware of a possible good movie, I am researching the possible plots and possible characters. I am very hyped. This happened to me before this movie came to theaters. MAYBE I HAVE CREATED MY OWN VERSION of what would happen in the movie (Like Ultron will be like the DC's Joker-Type Villain) and when my expectations did not happen, I became kind of disappointed.And honestly, I cared less at some point in the movie. 2. SPOILERS. Some of the best scenes were already everywhere so those scenes had less impact for me the moment I was watching. 3. LACK OF FOCUS. While watching, the thought of ""It was not what I've expected"" was bothering me even if the movie was far from the climax. Some scenes that seems ""new"" to me gave me the ""want"" to chat with my friend so my attention is not 90-100% in the movie. Thus, I have missed some scenes and important dialogs that made me say to myself that ""the next scenes we're irrelevant even though they really are relevant after all.""

Just an honest opinion here. As a cinephile (Yes, I'm not just fond of Marvel but I really like watching different genre of movies), this ""First Viewing"" effect happens to me often. Maybe this also happened to some. Maybe not. (One of my friend suggest that this also happened to her because a movie's story is sometimes new to her so she would watch again and the second time of watching really fixed everything and helped her find the movie an awesome one which is the real thing).

For those who are still planning to watch the movie for the first time, ""Don't bring the negative feeling that could come from the negative comments you've already read. It's better you don't expect so much. And just Enjoy the movie. After all, this movie, like any other movies, is a treat for yourself. A thing to enjoy ,therefore, releasing some stress. Don't be that one who is like making a school project where you must prepare a critic paper by finding the movie's weaknesses). Watch it with 100% attention to the the movie.

For those who have already watched it (especially those who suffered this ""first viewing effect""), Why not give the movie another shot? Maybe not in cinema again. Maybe some will change his/her view on the movie. And maybe, some will Not.

I am furious,22 May 2015,"I had to get this out of my system, so why not in form of review.

First here goes rant.Screw you Hollywood and yours peace of garbage,streamlined movies for brats.

Now to more constructive review (although, bare in mind if you read mini-series Age of Ultron,I am talking about comics by the way, you are going to be utterly and I repeat utterly disappointed , so don't bother reading further).

First of off when will this going to end ? Serious scenes that should make you sad,mad,scared are turned into comedy.This is fashion that is carrying over from infamous movie for kids (Hobbit 3 I am looking at you).Marvel universe is much more than listening to ""smart cracked jokes"" (to be frank only joke they got right is with Thor's hammer).

Movie has huge problem with pacing, villain is lame (the lamest there it is), I mean how exactly is what you presented in this movie Ultron ?Actually why it's called Age of Ultron ? Was this some agenda to attract more audience like comic fans for example or what ?People who read comics know what I am talking about, it is one of the best mini-series ever created (some people will beg to differ but like I care ..) .

It get's worse when they present Scarlet Witch and her brother Quicksilver.They had introduced two characters that play major role in Marvel Universe and spit at them by giving them like 10 min worth footage ? Action scenes are what you would expect,it's only thing done right.I want write anymore, because with each line I am getting more mad, so I will wrap it with one paragraph.However, before that let me just say, that while first movie didn't live up to my acceptation, I liked it, even with all things they got wrong,as for this one,If I could I would ask manager of cinema to refund my ticket because I would be better of If I had wasted money on something else.

If you are casual, new generation, unaware of MU until first movie and you simply don't give a damn about whole Universe setting,pale attempt, joke of the Avengers movie, go for it, it's made for people just like you.If you fall under category under unaware but willing to dig deeper than I suggest you skip this movie and go for comics.And I don't need to mention rest of us furious , viewers who felt betrayed ,now do I ?",3
3.6/5,14 May 2015,"Another year, another Marvel movie, and this time, the heroes are facing their greatest threat yet...A hype train. Last year's one-two punch combo of ""The Winter Soldier"" and ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" sees the studio sitting on a pile of money and critical praise. Now comes the sequel to the Avengers. It brings the earth's mightiest heroes, Iron Man, Captain America, Black Widow, Hawkeye, Hulk, and Thor together again, and this time they're fighting the biggest baddie of them all: Ultron(James Spader), intent on making a city into a comet to evolve humanity by destroying it...or something. James Spader was a fantastic choice, and his menacing voice and evilly pompous personality could make for a great villain...if the end didn't come down to him splitting himself into multiple copies, and having those copies attack everything that moves. For the smartest Avengers villain yet, his plan is remarkably similar to EVERY OTHER ONE. Ultron is aided by Scarlet Witch(Elizabeth Olson) and Quicksilver(Aaron Taylor Johnson) who both do serviceable as both lesser bad guys and reluctant heroes. They are, however, hindered by some bad Russian accents. From the opening scenes, it's clear that the formula of dialog from the first Avengers film is still here. That's great. Witty banter gives way to strangely thought-provoking statements, and some cutting-edge meta humor thrown in there for good measure. Joss Whedon(Creator of Firefly, Buffy, and Angel) is a master at this sort of thing, and he's back in his element. In fact, the standout scenes in the movie are the quiet ones. Hawkeye's conversation with someone very special who I will not reveal, Ultron's many monologues that bounce between philosophical and hilarious, and a fantastic party scene all come to mind. There are bits of dialogue in this film that sound like poetry, like when Ultron comments that he enjoys the ""geometry of belief"" in reference to a church being in the center of a town. However, the problems come from his trying to re-create the magic of the first film too much. The opening action scene is all shot in the one-take style that made the final scene of the 1st film so memorable. This time around, it's hindered by bouncy CGI, especially where Thor is concerned. His hammer doesn't look like it's connecting with anything, and the laws of physics are so bent that everything begins to feel pointless. This stuff is absolutely unacceptable in a movie of this size. It's refreshing that the film isn't too dark, like the trailers suggest, because that's not what these films are supposed to be. However, it certainly looks dark. The vibrant colors of Avengers 1 are replaced with drab yellows and whites that look good in Fincher films, not summer blockbusters. The issue of battle fatigue that films like ""Guardians"" have so masterfully avoided rears it's ugly head in ""Ultron."" Instead of a thrill ride, the final action scene is a slog, with almost no audience reaction in my theater. The cast is in fine form, and their chemistry is palpable...except for the most out of left field romance I've seen in a film of this kind. Bruce Banner and Black Widow's dialogue and actions toward each other are about as subtle as a punch from the Hulk, and about as well-written. There are other problems too, some plot holes, some storytelling. Overall though, fanboys will love it, casual fans like me will have fun, but the joy stops there, something that could not be said about Guardians, Cap 2, or the 1st Avengers.",7
A marvelous sequel!,8 May 2015,,10
A perfect opening scene,21 March 2020,"The opening sequence alone is a highlight. How computer animation, film and action combine here is unique. Part 2 of the superhero saga continued super. Music, excitement, actors. Everything fits together perfectly. A must for the cinema.",7
"A whirlwind of action that ties in all of the separate franchises, but a bit hectic",1 May 2015,"It began with a simple premise, conjured up in the mind of our favorite genius billionaire playboy philanthropist, Tony Stark: artificial intelligence. ""Peace in our time"", Tony says is the stated goal.

The end result is anything but.

Ultron is born out of good intentions, and so begins the Avengers' greatest challenge since, well, since the last movie. It is undeniable that this film is the best overall Marvel movie yet, as it successfully and not in an in- your-face manner, ties together all of the separate franchises and their characters (notably, Idris Ebla shows up as Heimdall and Hayley Atwell as Peggy Carter makes an appearance as well).

However, before the tempest over throwing down the 'undeniable' word grows too strong, let's point out some of this films more prominent weaknesses. Some of the best action is in the very beginning, but you end up missing some of the best parts because the film dives into it from the very first frame and you have to play catch-up to figure out what's happening (however, regular Agents of SHIELD viewers will be able to transition much easier).

Also, for those who are not fluent, or even slightly versed in Marvel lore, there will be many segments where characters are introduced where you just say 'who?' Finally, for those who are fans of the other films of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, this film will bring in some of your favorite supporting characters and then relegate them to bit parts (Falcon gets it the worst, he's in one scene in the beginning and a virtual flash frame in the end. Really?)

However, if you go into this movie with the strengths and weaknesses in mind, you will be hard pressed to argue with the assertion that this is Summer 2015's can't-miss movie.",8
Not the Best Avengers Film.,30 April 2019,"But still, an Avengers film. Love seeing all my favorite characters in a major battle, and the Hulk was awesome. Still, the storyline wasn't the best, could have been better.",7
Top Film,10 June 2015,"This action packed thrill ride hit the cinemas on the 2nd May 2015, and has been a blockbuster ever since, and is the sequel to the Marvel hit The Avengers. The film is full of action from beginning to end, making any other action classic look minuscule. This blockbuster tops the original Avengers, as it has a better storyline. Unlike the original this film begins with a action scene, as the other one took around 30 minutes to get going. Tony Stark and his group of superhero buddies, face a upheaval and face the daunting task of defeating their own creation of Ultron. This mega mind seeks to destroy the Avengers and create world peace but has the wrong idea on how to create it.

In The Avengers 2 : Age of Ultron we are faced with 2 new characters that join the team. The two are twins and are a social experiment. Who have a vendetta against one of the Avenging gang, but later face the harsh reality of being on the wrong side, Scarlett Witch and Quicksilver both fight for good but are both caught on the wrong side. The two children of Hydra face difficult challenges thorough the epic, and one faces a life changing event that will change their view and aspect on the world for ever. The Avengers 2 : Age of Ultron is a very good film, filled with action and romance from 2 unsuspected characters. Marvel as a world-wide company have exceeded all expectations of the film and made it better than the original.",10
Something Missing,13 May 2022,"""Age of Ultron"" feels like it lacks a little bit in terms of giving us an exciting plot. Ultron (James Spader) is a good villain. The entire ""Avengers"" cast does an excellent job here, as always, with Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Elizabeth Olsen, and Paul Bettany coming up as new faces.

The plot's a bit of a letdown, it seems more as a bridge to get us to ""Infinity War"" from the first film, in hindsight. A lot of mention of Infinity Stones and things we see later. Ultron's plot is basically a rehashing of the old ""Terminator"" movies, but he doesn't really show up and do anything threatening until the last half of the movie. The alien invasion of New York in the first film is a way better climax in my opinion.

It's obviously a necessary movie to watch as a continuing piece of character and story development for the MCU. The movie itself just isn't all that spectacular. Good performances from A-List actors and incredible special effects, but hollow on the inside.",7

Great time! But not quite there...,11 May 2015,"While the Age of Ultron does feel similar to the previous films in the Marvel cinematic universe the personalities of the full team of Avengers contributes to the enjoyment of this film. The chemistry of the actors provides for many humorous moments and allows for entertaining breaks between the awesome fight scenes. I'm interested to see a villain like Thanos who has had more build up for future films. Ultron was the best villain of Marvel phase 2 but his creation and character could have been fleshed out more and that would have added to this film. Marvel has yet to present a villain that meets the coolness of the good guys. Batman has the Joker, Superman has Lex Luther but Marvel seems to be struggling to find a villain that will last against their awesome heroes. Lets hope Thanos doesn't turn out to be lame.",9

Disappointing,11 November 2018,"The gang of superheroes from ""The Avengers"" (2012) return in this big-budget futuristic sequel to fight off another set of bad guys hell-bent on destroying the world.

The technical aspects of this film make it an enjoyable experience especially in the action sequences. The special effects are at their best when Mark Ruffalo's character turns into The Hulk. While the movie has a lot of heart, its dialogue is weak and far less engaging than the action scenes. Also, attempts at wit rarely succeed.

It can still be a fun outing as long as one doesn't expect too much.",6
Probably the best film of the year,12 May 2015,"I honestly don't understand why this film got such underwhelming reviews. I know some people haven't entirely caught up on the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but I think some people are just haters or DC fanboys.

I think this film is probably going to be the best film of the year. It wasn't perfect, but no Marvel film has been. Even Guardians wasn't perfect. This film was much better than the first film. It's got better action, a better villain, (Loki wasn't entirely established until Thor 2, but he's still almost as good in the first film) much more humor, and a cast of well acted characters that knocks Avengers out of the park.

Some people claimed that the story was weak, but all marvel story's are a platform for the action. This one was no different. And the final battle was no more ridiculous than the last 5 marvel films. Vision was by far the best part of the film, and he completely stole the show. Ultron gave a great performance with much more personality and humor than I expected, and stands as the MCU's 2nd best villain. Some people thought he was too soft, but I thought he would have been boring if they made him a stone cold killer. Hawkeye's performance was also much better, and he ranked as my 3rd favorite character in this film. Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch were also great, and as for the other characters, they were no worse than in the first film (except Thor)

My only real nitpicks are minor, and the only thing that took away any enjoyment were the jumpscares. Some of the characters didn't improve much, HYDRA was wasted (even though the opening sequence was awesome), death didn't play much of a theme at all, despite what Whedon said, so I felt like I was lied too, and the Black Widow/Hulk romance, while interesting felt incomplete. The ending and mid credits scene also fell flat.

Don't pay attention to the metascore when you go to see this movie (because I know you will) and don't lower your expectations. I didn't, and I wasn't disappointed.",10

Too much of the same,4 May 2015,"I will have to admit before starting this review I am one of the ones who wished that DC had bet Marvel out of the gate. That being said I enjoyed the first two Iron man movies, the first Thor, the first and second Captain America but The last Iron man, Thor and now this its just too much of the same thing. I wasn't going to go see this movie because I knew that after you destroy one city you've destroyed them all but I was interested in hearing James Spader do Ultron and to see what they were going to do with Jarvis. The more the movie went on the less I cared about even those two things and I really didn't like the whole Black Widow/Banner/Hulk thing. And the Hawkeye story was just unnecessary and pointless. I really hope that this is the end of the Avengers for a while but if the ending is any kind of hint I guess they'll be back.",5
Surprisingly boring.,22 April 2018,"""We're on a flying city, fighting robots, and I have a bow and arrow. None of this makes any sense.""

-Hawkeye

This movie is competent. The acting, effects and cinematography are all pretty good.

The problem falls with the story. Its pretty weak. Time is wasted on pointless, boring scenes. In the middle of the movie, there is a 20 minute sequence (that's not an exaggeration) where The Avengers are on a farm. The main villain is a robot. Watching the Avengers fight robots is boring. This movie tries to make nearly every character a comic relief, but there are only a few jokes that actually work.

I'm a fan of the Avengers, but this isn't a good movie.",6
Successful sequel to the first Avengers,14 September 2015,"This is a movie review for the 2015 sequel to the critically-acclaimed 2012 film, THE AVENGERS. This is the sequel, AVENGERS: AGE OF ULTRON, which is once again written and directed by Joss Whedon. After the success of the THE AVENGERS, another sequel was planned for a release of summer 2015, with the writer and director Joss Whedon returning and the entire cast retuning.

With S.H.I.E.L.D. destroying (after the events of the previous film) and the Avengers needing a hiatus from stopping threats, Tony Stark jumpstarts a dormant peacekeeping program, Ultron: a self-aware, self-teaching, artificial intelligence. However, his plan backfires when Ultron decides that humans are the main enemy and sets out to eradicate them from Earth, leaving it up to Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, The Hulk, Black Widow and Hawkeye, along with support from Nick Fury and Maria Hill, to stop him from destroying all life on Earth.

Along the way the Avengers encounter the powerful twins, Pietro Maximoff / Quicksilver and Wanda Maximoff / Scarlet Witch, who joins them in their fight becomes Avengers as well. They also encounter the familiar Vision.

I love the story of the sequel. I think I have to give credit to writer and director and creator of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., Angel and Buffy the Vampire Slayer creator Joss Whedon because he wrote the hell out of a script and directed this film wonderfully and he does let the story run through without feeling like a montage and 141 minutes --- 2 hours and 21 minutes long --- It is really okay and amazing because I have long waited for this movie because this one of my top 10 highly-anticipated movies of 2015 and this is really cool and Marvel does an incredible job with this film.

Robert Downey Jr. once again steals the show as Tony Stark / Iron Man and he shines in this film and he does a fantastic job this time around. Chris Hemsworth once again plays the role of Thor after playing him in the first two Thor movies, the first Avengers movie and he played James Hunt in the Ron Howard biography film RUSH and he does incredible, too. Mark Ruffalo, Chris Evans and Jeremy Renner return in their roles as Bruce Banner / The Hulk, Steve Rogers / Captain America and Clint Barton / Hawkeye and they all do an amazing job.

Scarlett Johannson plays Black Widow / Natasha Romanoff once again and she is great, but a lot of things had to be done because during the production of this film, she was pregnant with her second or first child, I don't know. Don Cheadle returns as Colonel James Rhodes and it is great to see him once again as Iron Patriot. Paul Bettany plays Vision and J.A.R.V.I.S. and he does great as both of them.

Now, we have the new characters: Aaron Taylor Johnson plays the role of Pietro Maximoff / Quicksilver and it is really good to see him play a superhero again after playing in GODZILLA and the superhero films KICK-ASS and KICK-ASS 2 and he does really great and amazing as Quicksilver.

We finally get to Elizabeth Olsen as Wanda Maximoff / Scarlet Witch and she is really cool and she is so HOT as Scarlet Witch and Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen would be really proud once they see there sister in the film. The performance from her is really great and she screams so loudly and she did a great job with the scream for her character and she is so awesome.

Finally, James Spader plays the title role and villain Ultron and he is simply amazing. Nothing else to say about him, he should win an Oscar for playing a villain, but it's not really going to happen.

The action is just amazing and when stuff goes down, stuff in the action sequences is going down and this is really amazing and fantastic for the film and I really do like the way the action is presented in 3D and IMAX 3D and this film is presented in a 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen format.

The trailers were the reason that I liked this movie and because everyone comes back for this sequel and they introduce new characters and they really done this really great. The music by Brian Tyler and Danny Elfman is really great and amazing. The cinematography, production design, editing, costume design, sound design and visual effects are all amazing, especially with the battle between the heroes and the Ultron drones and it was really cool.

Overall, I love AVENGERS: AGE OF ULTRON is really amazing and fantastic. This movie does not have any major flaws at all and I really think this deserve a lot of praise because this movie is just simply great. My rating is exactly a 9 out of 10. This is a superhero movie that I don't think gets enough critical attention and praise. I can't wait for the two-part sequel to this film, AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR, which PART 1 will be released in May of 2018 and PART 2 to be released in May of 2019. The stakes will be raised up for the next two AVENGERS movies and it will be really cool.",9
An average entry into the series,24 June 2019,"I love the MCU, although I've always felt that AOU wasn't very strong. The plot and internal logic seems thin although not without its great moments. Its necessary to watch for the overall timeline, but not very satisfying.",6
A Visual Spectacle Well-Balanced with Story,24 April 2015,"As Marvel continues to dominate the movie industry and box office, their latest outing 'Avengers: Age of Ultron' certainly one-ups its 2012 predecessor with new heroes, allies, and a formidable foe that makes previous villain Loki look like a tamed kitten. Since this movie marks the end of Joss Whedon's directorial position for Marvel, he pulled off such an amazing move by making the original film's light-hearted moments turn a little darker, but never straying completely away from character development and nothing short of more screen time for each. It's like, Whedon wasn't trying to make everything from the last movie better with more destruction or mayhem, along with the appearance of new characters without proper explanation (he's not Michael Bay), instead he balanced those out evenly with better depth story-wise.

When a rogue AI known as Ultron (voiced by Blacklist's James Spader) declares extinction on humanity in order to bring peace to the world, the Avengers must reunite to stop this new threat as it threatens other parts of the world, along the way fighting their own battles inside and out.

I was blown away with the original Avengers movie, and its sequel doesn't disappoint as I was literally at the edge of my seat. Unlike the previous film, this now gives Jeremy Renner's Hawkeye even more development into what he can really do on screen, complete with clever one-liners and stylized action sequences alongside his fellow co-stars. Scarlet Johansson's Black Widow had some light shed onto her backstory, which doesn't distract from the business at hand, only an insight into emotional depth (including her fellow allies). Robert Downey Jr. still has his wits portraying Tony Stark/Iron Man when mingling with anyone around him, while new faces Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch proved to be quite the brother-sister team (done strikingly well by Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Elizabeth 'Liz' Olsen respectively). Now as for the titular character himself Ultron, James Spader basically shaped the character with an ominous, cunning tone crossed with wittiness that could make anyone shake in fear or have a tendency to laugh when in his presence. Which is kind of rare in past Marvel villains. The accompanying underscore of both Brian Tyler and Danny Elfman - in place of original composer Alan Silvestri - made the action sequences and scenarios look and sound more suspenseful, breathtaking, and epic to every degree. In the end, each hero that fought admirably left behind amazing twists and tragedies I did not see coming (though I won't spoil it there). In fact, I feel the need to watch it again for some reason.

My thoughts: Admittedly, a few loose ends needed to be cleared up since it causes the main story to feel pretty vague to understand when connecting them with a few notable subplots, but for a second round of Marvel movie crossover, Joss Whedon assembled what appears to be yet another superb entry into the Marvel Cinematic Universe.",9
Very bland super-hero pic,1 August 2024,"The constant jibe of who gets the last word in seems forced, predictable and acts like an edit for the next scene. Coming out of the screening, there is not one scene or moment that i feel that i can walk away with in awe.

The romantic angle that was introduced lack chemistry. From out of nowhere, the characters involved suddenly had an interest for one another? Without any build up of it in past movies nor in this one, it just felt empty.

Camera angles that were purposefully shot for the intentional thrill of 3D is like any other angles used in any other 3D-movie-going-experience. I wonder when will this gimmick/trend go away.",6

7,11 September 2020,"I liked this one, already seen it before out of order so wasn't any shock value - I liked ultron as the villain though and Scarlet witch was a nice addition probably wouldn't watch it again though less interesting when you know what happens in the end",7
Age of ultron,16 February 2020,"What a great movie. With all the characters for the Avengers. Great special effects, lots of action and some humor. great cast",8
Out of place,18 January 2020,"Considering how good (and even amazing) the other Avengers movies are, Age of Ultron is a surprising disappointment. It's not terrible, but it is bad when compared to the other Avengers movies.",7
Scarlet Witch is my wifey,30 March 2020,"They do need to figure out how to settle on a genre with these movies, because I'm not sure what they were going for. At times it felt like I was watching a cartoon, and other times a sci-fi movie. I will say that James Spader's performance as Ultron was chilling. I got chills down my spine every time he spoke. The advantage of Disney owning Marvel is they can have villians sing otherwise happy Disney songs and ruin people's childhoods by making them creepy. Now, concerning the characters of Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch. (Scarlet Witch is my MCU crush!) Neither of their actor(esses) sounds genuinely Russian, and at times you can tell the accent is fake, because half the sentence will be in an American accent and the other half a ""Russian"" accent. I did enjoy the witty banter between all the members of the Avengers, and surprisingly, even Ultron had some witty dialogue. He is probably the best villain in any of the MCU films. Now, one more thing. I didn't put the ""One does not simply leave a Marvel movie before the end of the credits"" meme like I usually do, because there's only one scene after the first 2 minutes of credits, but nothing at the end, so don't wait for the very end of the credits. Grade; A- 9/10 4/5 stars",9
"Decent sequel, nowhere as good as some of the best ones",2 July 2018,"I'd watched this movie in theaters, but I don't remember a whole lot. I do remember the floating city and a new Avenger but that's about it. It did have a lot of action and good special effects and some new characters. Plus the original cast came back for more. I don't know if I'll see it again but it was decent for what it set out to become. It's no Dark Knight though.",6
Solid but predictable,6 April 2020,,8
"Despite Having It's Moments, It Is A Weak Effort",17 April 2019,"I just finished Avengers: Age Of Ultron and I have to say, it ranks down the bottom of the pile with Thor 2, Iron Man 2 and Iron Man 3. I enjoyed parts of it, the Hulk V Hulkbuster fight, the Banner/Romanov sub plot, the Hawkeye family, and some of the humour really worked, I especially loved the running joke about Thor's hammer and his face when Cap moved it was great. But overall, I found it lacking!! Especially compared to the brilliant first.

All of the cast fit their roles like gloves now, they are all comfortable in the roles and it shows. There is not a weak link, in the cast, but things like the collateral damage to civilian life (during things like Hulk V Hulkbuster) still bothers me. Like Thor: Dark World and Iron Man 3, It seems rushed. Did they start filming all of these without finished scripts?? It would explain things a lot, as they are not as polished as Captain America: Winter Soldier and Guardians Of The Galaxy.

Despite that, Age Of Ultron outgrossed both of them.",7
Not as good as the first one... more formulaic and derivative,1 May 2015,"The movie is good until the middle, the beginning is good and the fight between Iron-Man and Hulk is almost worth the price of admission, the comedy is awesome, but then there are some problems... it feels like a collection of action sketches not very cohesive and in different places in the world, it doesn't feel like a solid movie, and then...the ending is exactly the same as the first Avengers!!!,substitute New York for Slovakia and the Chitauri for Ultron's minions and is the same !!! it feels tired and repetitive and absolutely nobody clapped at the end of the movie on Opening Night!!!! and Loki is not even there, even the ""Captain America the Winter Soldier"" was far better!!!",4
Avengers reassembled,21 June 2022,"Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015) is good just not as good as The Avengers (2012). This movie is entertaining and fun to watch but can be slow at times.

The whole Avengers cast are great as the superhero team, and they are awesome in action scenes. The Avengers team has great chemistry, and they still work well together.

The main villain Ultron has some story around him and a reason to hate Tony Stark or the Avengers team, but it would be better if there was more to it. Other than that, he is a good villain.

The action scenes are great and awesome to watch. The effects are good, and they can have suspense, along with there being some MCU humor in the dialogue.

There are teases to upcoming MCU movies and the 3rd act final battle is great to watch. The Avengers (2012) is better but Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015) is still fun to watch.",7
"Extravaganza, thrilling, and My Favorite Movie",31 May 2016,"Avengers: Age of Ultron is my favorite movie, it has incredible action that blew my mind away. The movie had many surprises having Vision as a powerful and peaceful avenger and the hulk-buster that was a awesome and epic. I thought that Ultron was a dark, complicated, and emotional villain that made me think of him as my favorite villain. Ultron was extremely powerful with unique abilities that would make him one of the avengers dangerous threats. The beginning was fantastic with the movie setting the plot and then ending with tons of action and excitement leaving me with wanting to see more. Scarlet Witch and QuickSilver were amazing, each having formidable abilities and a tragic story. Captain America was heroic and brave and we got to see and know more about Hawkeye and it made me think how awesome he is. Black Widow and the Hulk showed a big love interest that made the movie better. Avengers: Age of Ultron is my favorite movie.",10

Not just any normal action superheros movie but has a lot of beautiful relationships and emotions that you find yourself crying,11 April 2022,"I love how this movie reflects on how human and sentimental the avengers are.

I felt the wormth inside Barton home and loved the relationships they'd had (with Nat and Mrs Barton and her kids) and created, like how a small house filled with love provided them a place to lay low and plan their way out of the crisis, like it was a substitute for the S. H. I. E. L. D HQ which is an aesthetic gesture for me. Their interactions there were really iconic.

Also found it touching that the true destructive powers to them wasn't any weapon whatsoever but it was manipulation in emotions and memories which is beautiful to some extent and shows their human side.",8
"Great comic inspired actions, mediocre character exploration.",24 April 2015,"'Avengers : Age of Ultron'

The wow factor is there, but the only thing falling short is the director's decision (probably STudio Exec's) to cut out additional one and the half hours. All the essential characters development is missing (especially the twins) and the whole movie feels like a mash up of 'after-events' rather than a flow of happenings. All of them could make us care more about their stories but instead now we only 'seem to care' about their actions. Many scenes in the film looks obviously shortened just to focus on actions and many issues left unresolved. For now, i will be anticipating the director's cut if there is any because it will look like more of a complete story.",7

Mediocre,14 June 2022,"For me the film was action heavy without any substance. There were lots of cool ideas being thrown around, but none of them properly developed. The ensemble of the avengers is great as always but this film added nothing new to the formula that the first film didn't have.",6
I'm Not Feeling the Hate,10 October 2016,"I can't understand the distaste people have for this. The Avengers were growing more comfortable with one another, a fact made clear in the script. In the first film we saw them learning to be a team, in Ultron we saw them acting as a team.

The script was fine, the acting was fine, in fact Spade stood out. Not only that but it raised a few questions as to what was coming next. It developed the characters better.

Some of it was a little over-the-top but you are watching a movie based on comic books.

The little romance may have stood out as forced & unnecessary, but, well that's only a reason to take away 1 star, not 9.

You get to see new characters, you get to laugh & you get to gobble up popcorn in & suck down sodas in the typical action/sci-fi induced hypnosis.

I honestly can't see all why it has so many negative reviews.",9
Good Marvel movie.,25 July 2018,"This is a really good movie, I had a lot of fun with this movie. It was a 9 but I dropped it down to a 7 because I just watched Avengers: Infinity War and that was AMAZING!!! This was a good movie, it really is. The problems that I have problems with is the fact that we have to much story, not enough action.",7
So awesome!,17 September 2021,"This was much better than the first Avengers movie, in my opinion. There was much more action & emotion! Honestly, it was a little frightening and thrilling as well! 10/10.",10
"This one was no better, but neither too worse than the first Avengers",7 November 2022,"Overall, this was definitely a swell continuation of the Avengers Initiative that really foresees focus on the Black Widow and Hawkeye the most, as they didn't have their own films especially. Most of the humor was Marvel's classic style, but I wouldn't consider as laugh-out-loud? As the first film. Loki of Asgard and Ultron both wanted something in common: Restored peace. They both made the fierce enemies that Marvel probably intended (the only real difference being Ultron as an A. I.). Vision was one of the greatest editions to the Avengers team. The over-the-top action was much anticipated, but of course it was much epic like the first film.",7
NAME OF THE AVENGERS SEQUENCE,14 March 2021,"The San Diego Comic-Con is bringing us incredible revelations and after the DC announcement of the Superman and Batman movie Marvel did not lag behind and announced the title of the sequel to The Avengers, will be Avengers: Age of Ultron.

For this ad, Marvel aired a teaser in which a red and gold armor (presumed to be Iron Man) appears in the beginning being constantly beaten by something invisible and as background the main characters' lines in the first film stating that the super team is not able to act together. It ends with Bruce Banner's phrase that the team is a ticking time bomb.

After that tense moment the camera comes close to the helmet that it is picking up and we realize that it is actually Ultron and not Iron Man. Even catching Ultron is smiling sinister. For those who don't know Ultron is a villain who was created by Ant-Man scientist Henry Pym.

In Marvel's Age of Ultron miniseries, Ultron dominates the Earth and shapes the world according to his wishes, and the only way to stop it is to go back in time and stop Pym from creating it. The feature (now titled) Avengers: Age of Ultron will premiere in May 2015. From CULTZONE Portal M.D. 2013-07-21",9
Scarlet Fever,25 April 2019,"Continuing the ""Endgame"" prep with ""Age Of Ultron"" a film that, somehow in my head is a bit of a misfire. Happy to report that, though this is perhaps the weakest of the three ""Avengers"" films, ""Ultron"" is still a decent film and has a lot of great moments.

Haunted by the threats from other worlds that he's seen, Tony Stark wants to replace the Avengers with Ultron, an autonomous artificial intelligence that would protect the Earth. Finally locating Loki's missing spear, he utilises the properties of the Mindstone Infinity Gem to bring Ultron to life. Faulty and psychotic, Ultron decides that the best way to protect the earth would be to rid it of the primitives that inhabit it.

I find it really hard to believe that this was only four years ago! It seems like a lifetime. ""Ultron"" gets off to a shaky start, I felt. The battle to capture Von Strucker is a little bit too frantic to be enjoyable, and the CGI occasionally is a little shaky, however, the film really picks up from here and neither of those flaws could be levelled against the rest of the film. Expanding the cast and adding a number of characters who would feature in ""Civil War"" and ""Infinity War"" was done well. The plot points for the whole Infinity Saga is starting to come together too, with Thor learning about the Infinity Stones and realising that someone is behind their recent appearances, perhaps that impacts on this film a little - as Ultron doesn't necessarily feel like the same threat that Thanos is.

I can't decide how I feel about James Spader's Ultron. His naturalistic delivery is fun, and often funny, but I'm not sure how realistic it would be for an artificially intelligence to display these sort of mannerisms. Visually he's not quite as good as say Thanos in ""Infinity War"", there's a sheen to the CGI that's not quite dead-on, maybe the moving mouth was a mistake too.

The film does have perhaps the single most rewatchable single scene in all the MCU, the battle between Hulk and Ironman in his Hulkbuster outfit. There is lots of good stuff in the final battle scenes also. With hindsight, it's easy to say that it was time for Whedon to move on from the MCU and for the Markus/McFeely/Russos to take the saga forward, and with their writing and direction they have elevated it to another level. But ""Age Of Ultron"" is a really really good film, that would, in any other series, be a highlight. Here's though, it's just a solid addition.",7
Delivers what is expected.,16 May 2015,,8
A high-stakes superhero sequel,18 June 2024,"""Avengers: Age of Ultron,"" directed by Joss Whedon, delivers another action-packed chapter in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, bringing together the beloved superhero team to face a formidable new foe. The story begins with Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) and Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) attempting to jump-start a peacekeeping program, which inadvertently leads to the creation of Ultron (voiced by James Spader), an AI with a destructive vision for humanity.

The film excels in showcasing the ensemble cast, with each Avenger getting their moment to shine. The chemistry among the characters, including Captain America (Chris Evans), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), adds depth to the narrative. New additions like Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) bring fresh dynamics to the team.

The action sequences are visually spectacular, with memorable battles that highlight each hero's unique abilities. Ultron proves to be a menacing and complex villain, adding to the tension and stakes of the story.

While ""Age of Ultron"" sometimes struggles with balancing its numerous plotlines and characters, it remains a thrilling and entertaining superhero spectacle. The movie's exploration of themes like artificial intelligence and the consequences of power adds depth, making it a worthy sequel that sets the stage for future MCU adventures.",7

A Decent Entry to the MCU,20 July 2020,"Age of Ultron is one of the lesser films in the MCU but still manages to be one of the more rewatchable in my opinion. With decent CGI and a great cast of characters, the film stays watchable. However the story of this film feels convoluted and very messy. The entire middle of this movie feels like a DCEU Movie, and I mean that in a bad way. Overall, Age of Ultron didn't live up to the hype and failed to be that great of a movie as well.",6
AVENGERS : AGE OF ULTRON,28 November 2018,"Expect the movie data base to welcome this movie because it had technology from another dimension.

Avengers: Age of Ultron,9 June 2024,"This is not a bad follow up to the first film. ""Stark"" (Robert Downey Jnr.) and ""Banner/Hulk"" (Mark Ruffalo) have a grand design to create a computer programme that will ensure peace on Earth for ever. Snag is, that programme hoodwinks ""Jarvis"" as well as both of them and turns into the rather menacing James Spader iteration of ""Ultron"" (yes, I too thought that was a detergent!). Anyway, ""Ultron"" concludes, not entirely unreasonably, that peace on Earth might be more attainable if mankind were actually to be the beings eradicated, so he sets about creating the ultimate vibranium-based weapon to accomplish this most dastardly of deeds. ""Stark"" must now rally the ""Avengers"" to thwart this plan - but can they combat the seemingly insurmountable odds and rescue mankind from oblivion? The usual suspects now congregate and using their combined strength and ingenuity take on their metallic foe and his equally lethal army of minions. My favourite has to be the cute and extremely nimble ""Pietro Maximoff"" (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) but there are plenty of decent efforts here that give the film a collegiate feel to it. There are a lot of characters, but for the most part Joss Whedon keeps them rowing in the same direction. The dialogue is poor, though - and I found that the robotic nature of their enemy robbed the film of much of it's mythological and characterful style, replacing it with frequently over-long fight scenes that seem to wreak havoc on everyone and everything except those actually fighting. Spader has some good lines to deliver, as does Chris Hemsworth's ""Thor"", but oddly the two leading characters - ""Stark"" and Chris Evans' far too goody-goody ""Capt. America"" proved to be much less effective here than before, as did Scarlett Johansson's pretty underused ""Natasha"". Still, for the most part this long, colourful, action epic flows well and proves to be an enjoyable big screen experience.",7
Almost an Action Chick Flick,3 May 2015,There are reviewers that completely did not get it. This was more than an action movie which apparently some of these people wanted or like others wanting to laugh. Well this was not a comedy and when they mix too much comedy into it you get George Clooney as Batmsn. This was a well scripted and plotted story with great interactions with characters and maybe a little too much Hawkman back story but the squeaky wheel does still get the grease in Hollywod though it may just needed to grease him like Loki. I like the fact that they took it a bit dark and showed the weakness of humanity and sometimes your Heros and Gods fail to live up to your expectations. The only true Hero lays in the hearts of peaceful humanity. This movie had everything a mature person would love and they have been gearing these films More to a crowd who have imaginations and like a good ride. Age of Ultron should not disappoint and if it has you really need to open your mind and absorb the character building and plots if you choose to continue to watch these franchises and TV adaptations or you will truly become lost as did Ultron. Just don't let it destroy you with your hating.,10
Just plain bad,26 November 2019,Don't be brainwashed. This is just a remix of the first Avengers movie. Nothing new here except for the new heroes but plot-wise it's pretty much the same thing.,6
Unnecessarily pretentious for a mindless blockbuster,3 March 2018,"The script was a major dog in this movie. Upon rewatching the film, it's clear these are different characters, not the same ones in the first. There's too much babble in this movie about topics only drugged out college kids and professors would discuss, not real people. It gets absolutely ridiculous after a while. Also, Marvel is hurting their movies having the superheroes be worried about every single innocent person. These heroes would be thanked in real life for their service, not chastised and condemned. Civilians condemn the Avengers for the lives of a few people dying in spite of the fact the villains were either trying to take over the entire world and kill a lot more or outright destroy it completely. It's ridiculous. The humans have no ability to control these superheroes either; they are Gods. They would answer to them, not the other way around. Like most babble from college types, it's just not grounded in reality, but more the result of ultra-privileged, sheltered lives and a lack of a willingness to understand how the average person operates.

The CGI model of Ultron was incredibly bad and made it hard to take him seriously. It was cartoonish, a total hack job. There's a reason they largely kept him out of the trailers. Not sure who was responsible for that, corporate hacks or whatever, but it really hurt the film.",3
A slightly weaker sequel to one of the best action movies of all time,6 April 2018,"Avengers: Age of Ultron stars Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, and James Spader with the rest of the avengers crew as they make and have to defeat the robot, Ultron, before he tries to destroy the world.

Writing wise this movie has some of the most memorable lines and scenes of the series. Including the famous party scene and the intro fight scene as well. But sadly this film lacks with it altering the overall story of the comics and it feeling like a rip off of the first Avengers film and even though it decides to take more of a risk with introducing three new characters and giving an explanation of what exactly the infinity stones are and how many exactly there are too. It doesn't stand up to the first one.

With Joss Whedon directing this film again like the first one he still kills it. With a bigger budget and the crew ready to go and kick ass is everything that a comic or movie fan wants. With the beautiful use of CGI to make Ultron feel real and relatable with his roboticness makes the directing of this film top notch.

The cast once again is amazing. With Spader killing it as Ultron and his soothing yet uneasy voice he uses in it to give life to this robot makes the film memorable in those senses. And Aaron Taylor Johnson and Elisabeth Olson as the twins, they add a new layer to Stark and show that there are a lot more unique people out there than just the 6 we love. And with Renner having more than roughly 26 minutes of screen time like in the first one. We get more depth of him as a person and as an avenger that makes us as an audience love him more.

With the script being not as strong as the previous film. This movie still stands up to being a great MCU film and holding some of my personal favorite scenes in the series.

This film was too much fun to critique.,19 May 2015,"Avengers: Age of Ultron is the second time we have seen the Marvel universe's greatest heroes come together on screen. I typically try to think about films critically and pick apart as many pros and cons as possible; however, I enjoyed watching this film so much that I turned that part of my brain off while watching. Is this a prefect film? No, it isn't; but I had so much fun watching everything unfold that I didn't care. Is this professional? It's not, and I don't plan on saying this often, but I don't want to critique a movie like this because I don't want to bring such a entertaining experience down in my memory. The characters are well developed, the overall universe is not afraid of moving on and changing things, people grow and learn, the action scenes are excellent, the villain evil, yet likable, and I could go on and on. Is it better than the first movie? Is some ways it is and in other ways it is not. Overall I definitely think it is a worthy sequel. I was entertained from start to finish and was left wanting more.",9

Exciting sequel that proves that Wheadon is the master of balancing characters.,27 April 2015,"This is a spoiler free review.

First off, let me begin by saying that this sequel has exceeded my expectations by a great amount. I was blown away by the sheer amount of spectacle and work Wheadon has put into making this sequel.

Well, in terms of comparing it with the the first Avengers movie, it would be high impossible to impact pop culture in such a way the previous one did. Wheadon recognizes this, and hence the movie feels fresh because it takes a new path, a painful path for the heroes. It feels more personal, more on what it takes to be a hero and and how being a hero means having no place in society. It's definitely fresh, and avoids the mistake most sequels do by aiming to go bigger and more of everything.

Avengers 2 isn't a mass event like it's predecessor, but instead a much better movie that chooses to focus on character arcs and most importantly, the story.

Ultron played by James Spader is a great villain. He's just like a human trapped in robot's body. He behaves like a spurned son of Tony Stark, and hates his father more than anything. He also has twisted views on how to achieve peace, since he was ""born"" very recently, and so sees nothing wrong with genocide because he isn't human. Unlike other Villains of Marvel, he doesn't just make a joke now and then, and in only scene is he humorous, simply because he is naive.

In shot, he is a very, VERY unique villain that I've never seen before, and really hope that he returns.

However, the thing I admired more about the movie was how Wheadon manages to for around 16 MAIN characters in the movie, give convincing origins for Quicksilver, Scarlrt Witch and Ultron, enough to symphatize with them throughout the movie. He does it skillfully and artfully and it is integrated seamlessly into the movie.

Some of the so called critics have complained that the movie feels very fast and some scenes have to be deleted. However, I can honestly say that it is not so. Yes, there's a lot going on in the movie. But no, it isn't overstuffed. It simply means that you can enjoy this movie more and more every time you watch it. This is a movie that gets better with repeat viewings, because you absorb something new every time, whether it be something you missed or a fancy easter egg.

Overall, this is a fantastic addition to the MCU, and possibly the best superhero movie of all time.

"Some stand out moments and some excellent dialogue and sequences twinned with bland action, mark-missing gags and extraneous nonsense.",18 February 2020,"This film is a finely tuned $10000 watch that's been rendered useless by being run over by a Ferrari. It's perfect parts lay splayed and although each one is worth a mint. The whole can't tell the time any more - it's useless. Shout out to Ultron's James Spader and his overall design.

Just as muddled and overstuffed and cringey as it is brimming with creativity, in-jokes and references and creative action sequences.

It's hard to love this move but it's hard not to admire it. Had it come in two parts with some more relaxed pacing, it would have been heralded a triumph.",6
Entertaining enough for your Marvel fan. Average viewer may need homework.,2 May 2015,"So after a very successful first film in what is a very popular franchise Avengers: Age of Ultron brings the team back together for another world-saving event. This time, instead of Tom Hiddleston's power-hungry Loki, it's the menacing A.I. robot played brilliantly by James Spader. And that's what is a really great addition to the film; Spader is such a good bad guy, his voice didn't go through any filters, he did motion-capture for the face so you get all his mannerisms and in an 8-foot robot, that is very effective. The other two new cast members I enjoyed more than I expected too, they did a great job as the enhanced twins and their powers were very enjoyable to watch on screen. Of course our main heroes are always brilliant in their roles and it's great to see them all interact both while battling and in casual situations.

Plot-wise, it's a very different film from the first, the Avengers are known-all over the world so it's interesting to see what various countries think of them and what they do which they play on well; it also shows that they're not always that invincible, the team gets hit hard in this film more than they have done before and we get to see how they overcome that. All-in-all I really enjoyed the story.

The only negative things I have to say about the film is that the opening segment lasted a bit long and the final battle didn't quite seem as good as the first film but other than that this is a another fantastic Marvel movie; there are some exciting easter eggs of what's to come and Paul Bettany's Vision is a fascinating addition to the franchise who I am very much looking forward to seeing more of.",9
Enjoyable,12 September 2023,"I have a heard time reviewing these marvel films I've never really been a big fan of the univers but I've been trying to watch all of them in chronological order. Some of them I've seen were really good, some really boring this one was messy to say the least. It wasn't bad but in comparaison to the first one it's less good. I feel like in these avenger films there are too much characters with a lot forgettable or underdeveloped. I don't really know what to think about some of them but I don't really have negative stuff to say about them either I guess I will see in the other films to see how they evolve and contribute. But overall it's a good, messy and enjoyable film.",7

Avengers: Age of Ultron is no longer as surprising as the first part,13 May 2022,"Avengers: Age of Ultron is no longer as surprising as the first part. Perhaps this is due to the fact that there is no such gap between the crossover and solo films of the cinematic universe. Avengers: Age of Ultron has no distinct antagonist. And the only thing that is remembered in the future is the appearance of several new actors. Well, the final battle turned out to be a second-rate, invented Slavic-Balkan country, which American heroes save looks complete hypocrisy, against the background of real events of 2000.",6
Immensely Entertaining,8 May 2015,"Beginning with 2008's Iron Man, Marvel's franchise is a behemoth larger than any of its heroes or villains. While much of that is due to its box-office numbers and zeitgeist power, its quality and soul are the things that make it stand apart, and Ultron is no different. Maybe the novelty of seeing these demi-gods on the big-screen just hasn't soured for me yet, but I found Ultron's nerd-splosion to be (mostly) unendingly awesome. It may have an over-abundance of characters and too many battles, but it's also quick witted, thematically grounded, and immensely entertaining enough to satisfy any fan. This Comic-Con-come-to-life adventure kicks off with our guys fighting side-by-side, a truly cinematic moment of epic proportions that doesn't disappoint. They are brought together to fight Ultron, a botched creation of Stark's whose power and ruthlessness are equally endless. As the plot unfolds, it feels more like a well- constructed bridge to better (and darker) places than a destination unto itself, but the wonderful performances and dialogue guide the festivities delightfully. Deeper, though, is a recognizable political element to the proceedings; Cap and Tony stand-in for our own two-party government system, while showing presenting these disparate ideals as less black-and-white as we often think. Sure, Ultron is lesser in almost every way to the original, which was arguably the greatest superhero movie of all- time. People sick of superhero epics will most assuredly not be persuaded by Ultron. However, those of us who still find endless joy in likable characters, snappy humor, and strong themes in their action movies will be far disappointed.",5
Ensemble pieces are hard.,25 November 2019,"You have several main characters revolving around one goal, but all of these characters should be unique and driven by their own wants and needs, but all of those wants and needs need to be connected to the core of the story. When you take half a dozen heroes who are (largely) off on their own adventures most of the time, it can take some doing, and I don't think that doing was done quite well enough here.

The Avengers have been wiping out Hydra one base at a time for some months and have come across the final large stronghold. They quip their way to victory, discovering Loki's spear from the first Avengers as well as two ""enhanced"" individuals (one who's fast and the other that's weird). With the spear, Tony Stark and Bruce Banner begin to analyze it in order to figure out how to take advantage of it. What they end up doing is creating Ultron, an advanced AI that takes a cryptic mission from Tony (""peace in our time"") and twists it in a very Asimov sort of way to mean all of human life must end because there will be no peace with people. He overcomes Tony's personal digital assistant (Jarvis), inhabits a robotic body and uploads himself to the Internet so he can escape into anything he wishes.

There's a fight, Ultron escapes, he finds some vibranium (helpfully expanding the MCU slightly in the process with references to Wakanda), and escapes again, this time with the help of the two enhanced. He escapes to South Korea where he uses a scientist to create a ""real"" body for him (how this is appreciably better than his upgraded body he gets later isn't really explained). Through another action sequence, the Avengers steal this body and then bring it to life so that it becomes Vision. Everything converges in the invented Central European country Sokovia (where the movie opened) where Ultron, who's been talking positively of the asteroid that destroyed the dinosaurs throughout the movie, has creating a system that will life the capitol city up in the air before dropping it to the ground with enough force to cause a global extinction event, which the Avengers avert. Because of course.

So, there's the plot. A lot is going on. I think the stuff around the creation of the body that becomes Vision is really just there so we can get Vision. As part of Ultron's plan, it feels extraneous at best. His end goal is human extinction. Having some sort of humanish metal body feels just extra. But around this large, somewhat unfocused, plot we have our heroes, and as I implied earlier, not a lot of them seem to be there for any other reason than they are Avengers.

First, let's talk about what this movie is supposed to be about. The first Avengers was really an excuse to get superheroes together to fight a heavy. The underlying idea was about team building. It was facile, but it worked and every character was functioning towards that goal. In this, the goal seems to be centered around Tony Stark's desire to create a replacement for the Avengers in the form of a highly intelligent AI that will protect Earth from threats originating from off world. It's an extension of where Tony was left at the end of Iron Man 3. He wants Iron Man to be unnecessary. The creation he ends up with fights back (using ""I've got no strings"" from Pinocchio quite effectively in a creepy sort of way), and Captain America's assertion that humans should always be part of the decision making process ends up correct. In terms of characters who seem involved in this thematic idea you have Tony, Bruce Banner, Captain America, and Hawkeye. The rest feel extra, taking the movie in different directions.

Thor is the one who seems the most out of place. He's there for a literal reason (Loki's scepter is supposed to go back to Asgard with him), but outside of that he doesn't really contribute to any of the movie's core idea. In fact, he famously goes off in the middle of the movie to help inform the audience about Infinity Stones. They sacrificed cohesion of the film itself in order to help sell later installments of the franchise, and the movie suffers for it. Black Widow also feels like she's in another movie. The exploration of her past is interesting, but I don't see how it feeds into the ideas at the movie's core. What this does overall is create a disjointed experience that keeps the movie from coming together as a single work.

There's quite a few individual pieces of the film that I like quite a bit. The action scenes are fun (though, we get another big CGI army). I really like Ultron himself. He's not just a quippy form of Loki. He's driven by an ideology and a set of beliefs all while talking in a way that betrays the malfunction at his core. The relationship that begins to blossom between Natasha and Bruce is both sweet and tied to some interesting unique parts of their characters (Natasha's insistence that she's a monster and her ability to draw Bruce out of the Hulk). And I really like the central idea and how that manifests in Ultron. I just wish the movie came together a bit better.",6

Age of Ultron once again delivers an entertaining but inferior sequel to the Marvel ensemble hit,26 April 2015,,6
Whats with all the hate? (,3 May 2015,"I get that even with the greatest movies like Star Wars, Dark Knight and Avenger, that not everyone is going to love it. People will have different opinions or some plot holes will be more annoying to others, but oh my god; what is with all the hate for this movie? I'd be okay with '7's' or 6's but i've been seeing a lot of 1's and thats upsetting to me. At first i thought these were just trolling haters or snooty critics that think superheroes are nothing more than children entertainment, but after reading some of these reviews and seeing the numbers tallying up i know these are legitimate fans upset with this movie. And all I can say is, Im sorry.

I don't mean that in a sarcastic way like, ""Oh sorry you have bad taste in movies."" No I mean sorry as in, ""Im sorry we couldn't see the same movie."" I loved the action, I loved the comedy, I loved the characters, I loved the villains...design and facial expressions (Yes they give Ultron facial expressions It's really neat). The only thing that bothered me a little was the Bruce and Natasha romance. Not because, ""Oh it wasn't in the comics"" but... I don't know I didn't love it and I didn't hate it.

All I can say is Im upset all the marvel fans couldn't enjoy this movie together, but maybe thats a good thing. I guess its better people gave their honest opinion and not like it just because its Marvel.",9
Not as good as the first,21 May 2018,"I thought it was kind of disappointing. Some of the action scenes were fun, but it had too many additional superheroes and the story was typical for a Sci fi movie: Robots invading and destroying Earth. I wanted to like it, but the first had more action and laughs and was paced better. Some of this dragged. It had some cool stuff, but the original had a more interesting story because the superheroes hadn't met before, so those interactions were unpredictable and fun. This seemed too familiar. No, it was similar to other Sci fi movies like Matrix and Terminator where robots are destroying mankind. It continues the first, but Nick Fury is given nothing to do, Thor acts more ""normal"" I guess, it had a few big action scenes, but not as many as the first. It had more superheroes though.",6
Avengers:Age of Ultron,29 November 2015,"In the Eastern European country of Sokovia, the Avengers – Tony Stark, Steve Rogers, Thor, Bruce Banner (Hulk), Natasha Romanoff, and Clint Barton – raid a Hydra outpost led by Baron Wolfgang von Strucker, who has been experimenting on humans using the scepter previously wielded by Loki. They encounter two of Strucker's experiments – twins Pietro, who has superhuman speed, and Wanda Maximoff, who can manipulate minds and project energy – and apprehend Strucker, while Stark retrieves Loki's scepter.

Stark and Banner discover an artificial intelligence within the scepter's gem, and secretly use it to complete Stark's ""Ultron"" global defense program. The unexpectedly sentient Ultron, believing he must eradicate humanity to save Earth, eliminates Stark's A.I., J.A.R.V.I.S., and attacks the Avengers at their headquarters. Escaping with the scepter, Ultron uses the resources in Strucker's Sokovia base to upgrade his rudimentary body and build an army of robot drones. Having killed Strucker, he recruits the Maximoffs, who hold Stark responsible for their parents' deaths by his weapons. Together, they go to the base of arms dealer Ulysses Klaue in an African shipyard to obtain Wakandan vibranium. The Avengers pursue them, but Wanda subdues the Avengers with haunting visions, causing the Hulk to rampage until Stark stops him with his anti-Hulk armor.2

A worldwide backlash over the resulting destruction, and the fears Wanda's hallucinations incited, send the team into hiding at Barton's safehouse. Thor departs to consult with Dr. Erik Selvig on the meaning of the apocalyptic future he saw in his hallucination, while Romanoff and Banner plan to flee together after realizing a mutual attraction. However, Nick Fury arrives and encourages the team to form a plan to stop Ultron. In Seoul, Ultron forces the team's friend Dr. Helen Cho to use her synthetic-tissue technology, together with vibranium and the scepter's gem, to perfect a new body for him. As Ultron uploads himself into the body, Wanda is able to read his mind; discovering his plan for human extinction, the Maximoffs turn on Ultron. Rogers, Romanoff, and Barton find Ultron and retrieve the synthetic body, but Ultron captures Romanoff.

The Avengers fight amongst themselves when Stark secretly uploads J.A.R.V.I.S. – who is still operational after hiding from Ultron inside the Internet – into the synthetic body. Thor returns to help activate the body, explaining that the gem on its brow – one of the six Infinity Stones, the most powerful objects in existence – was part of his vision. This ""Vision"" and the Maximoffs accompany the Avengers to Sokovia, where Ultron has used the remaining vibranium to build a machine to lift a large part of the capital city skyward, intending to crash it into the ground to cause global extinction. Banner rescues Romanoff, who awakens the Hulk for the battle. The Avengers fight Ultron's army while Fury arrives in a Helicarrier with Maria Hill, James Rhodes and S.H.I.E.L.D. agents to evacuate civilians. Pietro dies when he shields Barton from gunfire, and a vengeful Wanda abandons her post to destroy Ultron's primary body, which allows one of his drones to activate the machine. The city plummets, but Stark and Thor overload the machine and shatter the landmass. In the aftermath, the Hulk, unwilling to endanger Romanoff by being with her, departs in a Quinjet, while the Vision confronts Ultron's last remaining body.

Later, with the Avengers having established a new base run by Fury, Hill, Cho, and Selvig, Thor returns to Asgard to learn more about the forces he suspects have manipulated recent events. As Stark and Barton also leave, Rogers and Romanoff prepare to train new Avengers: Rhodes, the Vision, Sam Wilson, and Wanda.

In a mid-credits scene, Thanos, dissatisfied by the failures of his pawns, dons a gauntlet3 and vows to personally retrieve the Infinity Stones.",10
"A flawed plot, but still able to entertain...",19 July 2020,"The biggest problem with basing the plot of your movie around fighting an AI, is that a true AI is unbeatable... a true AI is capable of simultaneously controlling all robotic facilities on earth, at the same time, and endlessly creating a perfect army of their own flawless design... you simply can't beat an AI. And that's where the plot-holes start in this movie: Ultron doesn't act like a true AI. Ultron makes mistakes, and he is endlessly inefficient. A true AI can launch all nukes on earth in an instant and smash all satellites in orbit around the earth into each other, thus stopping all communication on earth, OR even better, he could reroute all satellites to ONLY relay his own communications. So like I said, you can't beat a true AI, because the human race and even the avengers, are powerless without technology and if that same technology/weapons is used against them in the form of robots/nukes then the human race stands no chance in defending itself.

Anyway... the movie, apart from the plot-holes, is a pretty standard Marvel movie: Bad guys appear, the heroes fight said bad guys, and the movie ends. It's not as good as Deadpool or Thor Ragnarok, but it's still completely capable of providing 2hrs10mins of entertainment. 7/10.",7

Enthralling !!!,25 April 2015,"Avengers turned out to be as thrilling and exciting as its first part. It was definitely good but not as great as the original.

Avenger are threatened by new enemy Upton is spawned from a peace program initiated by Tony Stark keeping other members out of loop. However , things turn topsy turvy when the program goes horribly wrong as he plans an attack on Earth and wage a war against mankind and turn humans into his slave. Together, Avengers with new members must fight the evil Ultron.

It would have been really challenging for Joss Whedon, director of Serenity and the original Avengers, to make a film by assembling all the superheroes in one flick but to my surprise he did a fantastic job and turned this comic-story into a must-see film. Of course, if you would have followed their original parts then this will be easy to continue. The differences between the characters has been portrayed ecstatically. 1st half boast of some path-breaking action sequences. The street fight between Iron man and Hulk is astounding. 2nd half loses the steam with so many stories interwoven under the same umbrella. Couple of scenes that easily stands out are conversation between Ultron and Iron man, the chemistry between the black widow and the Hulk. Climax fighting depicted reminds you of the first part which is well executed. Screenplay is effective along with punching dialogues Cinematography is enthralling. The CGI is magnificent with thrilling visual effects. On the flip side , any superhero movie is supported by electrifying background which is clearly missing here. Nevertheless, it is compensated by powerful performances by rest of the starcast especially Robert Downey Jr who clearly stands out in his portrayal of Ironman and witty one- liners. He is just getting better with each film. Surprisingly, I liked Scarlette Johanson as the Black Widow.

Overall , an action-packed entertainment with good storyline , lovely performances and superb CGI. It definitely misses the mark when compared to the previous part but do you even care when you have the privileged to watch all the superheroes under the same umbrella. GOOD 3/5",7
Rated G,3 May 2015,"This is the worst Marvel movie has ever made. Think of all the movies Marvel has made. Now think of the one you hated the most.....put this movie below it. After the first 30 minutes i wanted to go home and go to bed. Plus I'm tired of Stan Lee making cameos. Its not cool and he's an awful actor. Marvel is tacky. Plot: Ultron is everywhere, he is the internet, a city is floating, and seriously how many times does Thanos have to appear after the credits to threaten Earth? DO NOT PAY TO SEE THIS MOVIE, download it for free. DC comics gets their movies right. Marvel is a whore and Im glad I sold all my comics because they peaked in the late 1990's. Hollywood is beating a dead horse.",1
"The Avengers return in an entry that while not without its moments, feels a decidedly lesser effort this time around",8 April 2023,"Following the collapse of S. H. I. E. L. D. during the events of The Winter Soldier, The Avengers stage a raid on a HYDRA stronghold in the Eastern European nation of Sokovia rousting their forces and recover Loki's scepter, unaware the stronghold houses two genetically engineered Sokovians in fraternal twins Pietro and Wanda Maximoff (Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen respectively) with Pietro in possession of superspeed while Wanda is a very powerful psychic and telekinetic. As Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) goes inside the stronghold Wanda creates a vivid vision in Tony's which spurs him to convince Thor (Chris Hemsworth) to let him and Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) study the scepter which Tony intends to use as a basis for an automated defense system to fend off more attacks like the Chitauri one in New York. Unbeknownst to Tony, the project yields results earlier than expected as the artificial intelligence Ultron (James Spader) is created and taking Tony's words of ""Peace in our time"" as his directive sets out to take out the Avengers and convinces Pietro and Wanda to work alongside him.

Prior to the release of the Avengers, Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige made clear his intentions the second phase following the first Avengers movie would likewise culminate in another Avengers crossover with an option for writer director Joss Whedon to return. With the Avengers a massive success upon release, Joss Whedon quickly returned to not only direct the sequel, but also to develop the MCU companion TV series Agents of S. H. I. E. L. D. and even Robert Downey Jr. Agreed to return despite his contract having been fulfilled with Iron Man 3 agreeing to both this film as well as another Avengers film. While the film was a massive commercial success bringing in $1.4 billion against a $365 million budget (though possibly as high as $500 million according to some estimates) and while critical reception did lean positive, but with a fair number of people considering it not as good as the prior film. There are individual scenes or moments within Age of Ultron that are impressive, but the whole affair feels like its missing something and it feels more unbalanced and less satisfying than its predecessor.

In terms of performances I think it should be fairly obvious by now that the characters I said still inhabit their roles well is no less true this time around. Paul Bettany gets to do a bit more as Downey's A. I., J. A. R. V. I. S. this time around and Aaron-Taylor Johnson and Elisabeth Olsen are solid newcomers to the series. I guess my main issue with the film really comes down to Ultron himself as he's nowhere near as good of a villain as Loki and feels rather lacking as an antagonist for this team. I think a big part of what made the first Avengers work so well was all the little pieces teased in the lead-up films that eventually lead to them all coming together as pieces in The Avengers, and with Ultron we don't have that build-up as he's just a standard rogue A. I. only distinguished by James Spader doing the voice. If they were going to do a villain like this they really should've setup something in at the very least Iron Man 3 but since every MCU movie in phase 2 has been more focused on building up Thanos and the Infinity Stones, Ultron just feels like a placeholder until a more interesting villain shows up. I also felt like the writing wasn't as good as the first Avengers film with some not particularly good handling of Black Widow's character and I also felt like Pietro and Wanda allying themselves with Ultron made the characters feel pretty stupid and it felt like a contrived excuse to have the ""heroes fighting heroes"" stuff from the first movie only making less sense.

Avengers: Age of Ultron is a movie I honestly struggle to remember after viewing it. There are some good fight scenes or character moments spread throughout, but the movie as a whole just feels so much more cluttered, messy, and unfocused without that same feeling of satisfaction you got from the buildup and release of the first one.",6
Avengers: Age of Ultron wages war against the close minded.,2 May 2015,"Let me begin this review by stating that, if you're sick of the ""typical Superhero story formula"", then this movie is absolutely not for you. The people that are going to get the most enjoyment out of this movie are those that have enjoyed previous Marvel films. With that being said, let me get to the key points of what made this movie a success through my eyes.

The absolute most important thing for these movies to accomplish, is bringing comic book characters to life, to the point that you forget that you're watching someone portray a character, and simply are viewing the character in their natural form. For that, I'll give this movie an A+. The cast is the same as the previous films, but never before has each character seemed so comfortable within their roles, and their relationships to one another.

Ultron, as a Villain, is one of the best that the Marvel Universe has created. If I had to fault this movie for anything as it pertains to Ultron, I'd fault them for not involving his character enough. The screen time that this character receives is far less than he deserves, and I absolutely hope that's made up for with the directors cut once it's released. Ultron is convincing, funny, maniacal, and really just bizarre. Ultron, as plenty of great villains do, believes that he is the good guy throughout the film. He's not evil for the sake of being evil. He's good in his own mind, and that belief actually caused me as the viewer to almost feel bad for him, before remembering that he's a machine. He'll very likely be my favorite villain in the entire Marvel Universe after a few more viewings, and that's saying something, with how fond I was of ""The Winter Soldier"" as a Villain.

The ""typical Superhero story formula"" is definitely present throughout this film, but if you can keep your mind open, and look at everything else that's going on, you'll come out of this film satisfied. The character development, humor, and even storyline are so prominent and well done that it outweighs, by far, the ""I've seen this before"" thought process, because a lot of it, you really *haven't* seen before. I'm not going to say ""Ignore the critics"", but I will say simply, see this movie for yourself. Form your own opinion. Judge it based on what it is, not what you'd like it to be. If you walk into the theater, or turn on your TV, with an open mind, then you'll likely be as impressed with this movie as I am.",9

Not as good as the first... But close.,26 April 2015,,7
Successful sequel to the first Avengers.,27 April 2015,"This is an early movie review for the 2015 sequel to the critically-acclaimed 2012 film, THE AVENGERS. This is the sequel, AVENGERS: AGE OF ULTRON, which is once again written and directed by Joss Whedon. After the success of the THE AVENGERS, another sequel was planned for a release of summer 2015, with the writer and director Joss Whedon returning and the entire cast retuning.

With S.H.I.E.L.D. destroying (after the events of the previous film) and the Avengers needing a hiatus from stopping threats, Tony Stark jumpstarts a dormant peacekeeping program, Ultron: a self-aware, self-teaching, artificial intelligence. However, his plan backfires when Ultron decides that humans are the main enemy and sets out to eradicate them from Earth, leaving it up to Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, The Hulk, Black Widow and Hawkeye, along with support from Nick Fury and Maria Hill, to stop him from destroying all life on Earth.

Along the way the Avengers encounter the powerful twins, Pietro Maximoff / Quicksilver and Wanda Maximoff / Scarlet Witch, who joins them in their fight becomes Avengers as well. They also encounter the familiar Vision.

I love the story of the sequel. I think I have to give credit to writer and director and creator of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., Angel and Buffy the Vampire Slayer creator Joss Whedon because he wrote the hell out of a script and directed this film wonderfully and he does let the story run through without feeling like a montage and 141 minutes --- 2 hours and 21 minutes long --- It is really okay and amazing because I have long waited for this movie because this one of my top 10 highly-anticipated movies of 2015 and this is really cool and Marvel does an incredible job with this film.

Robert Downey Jr. once again steals the show as Tony Stark / Iron Man and he shines in this film and he does a fantastic job this time around. Chris Hemsworth once again plays the role of Thor after playing him in the first two Thor movies, the first Avengers movie and he played James Hunt in the Ron Howard biography film RUSH and he does incredible, too. Mark Ruffalo, Chris Evans and Jeremy Renner return in their roles as Bruce Banner / The Hulk, Steve Rogers / Captain America and Clint Barton / Hawkeye and they all do an amazing job.

Scarlett Johannson plays Black Widow / Natasha Romanoff once again and she is great, but a lot of things had to be done because during the production of this film, she was pregnant with her second or first child, I don't know. Don Cheadle returns as Colonel James Rhodes and it is great to see him once again as Iron Patriot. Paul Bettany plays Vision and J.A.R.V.I.S. and he does great as both of them.

Now, we have the new characters: Aaron Taylor Johnson plays the role of Pietro Maximoff / Quicksilver and it is really good to see him play a superhero again after playing in GODZILLA and the superhero films KICK-ASS and KICK-ASS 2 and he does really great and amazing as Quicksilver.

We finally get to Elizabeth Olsen as Wanda Maximoff / Scarlet Witch and she is really cool and she is so HOT as Scarlet Witch and Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen would be really proud once they see there sister in the film. The performance from her is really great and she screams so loudly and she did a great job with the scream for her character and she is so awesome.

Finally, James Spader plays the title role and villain Ultron and he is simply amazing. Nothing else to say about him, he should win an Oscar for playing a villain, but it's not really going to happen.

The action is just amazing and when stuff goes down, stuff in the action sequences is going down and this is really amazing and fantastic for the film and I really do like the way the action is presented in 3D and IMAX 3D and this film is presented in a 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen format.

The trailers were the reason that I liked this movie and because everyone comes back for this sequel and they introduce new characters and they really done this really great. The music by Brian Tyler and Danny Elfman is really great and amazing. The cinematography, production design, editing, costume design, sound design and visual effects are all amazing, especially with the battle between the heroes and the Ultron drones and it was really cool.

Overall, I love AVENGERS: AGE OF ULTRON is really amazing and fantastic. This movie does not have any major flaws at all and I really think this deserve a lot of praise because this movie is just simply great. My rating is exactly a 9 out of 10. This is a superhero movie that I don't think gets enough critical attention and praise. I can't wait for the two-part sequel to this film, AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR, which PART 1 will be released in May of 2018 and PART 2 to be released in May of 2019. The stakes will be raised up for the next two AVENGERS movies and it will be really cool.",9
The bar is set high,7 July 2015,"And therefor it's not as surprising to see/hear people being disappointed in the outcome. But the movie itself is more than decent, if you watch it free of any comparisons. And I don't mean free as in not connected (Guardians of the Galaxy can be seen as that), but as in not comparing it in scale or humor to the other entries in the franchise. Phase 3 is a go after this.

Since I'm not that familiar with the comics themselves I cannot compare nor am I ""biased"" or preoccupied/preconceived by anything. So characters coming up and the interpretation of them are fresh as they are presented. It might take the ""easy"" way out in some cases, but overall the odds are against stacked against our heroes.

Apart from building up on the previous build ups and Hawkeye/Widow getting more screen time, what I do like, is the fact that you get little jokes throughout the movie. The ""language"" joke might annoy some, but I like little gems like that myself. Obviously some people are fed up with Superhero movies, but that won't change the fact, that they are here to stay ... and entertain if you let them",8

Whedon Triumphs Again With Avengers!!!,17 May 2015,,10
Marvel Disney hit it out of the park once again,15 July 2015,"AVENGERS AGE OF ULTRON review of Mike Smith

When Tony Stark and Bruce Banner try to jump-start a dormant peacekeeping program, things go to hell and it's up to the Avengers to stop the villainous Ultron from enacting his terrible plans.

The first Avengers movie was awesome! Guardians of the Galaxy was amazing! So how do you top those two juggernaut movies? You make the film a little darker, make it a bit more mature, add more comedy and funny banter between the cast and amp up the action to 11.

By now it's no surprise that the cinematography was stunning and the action scenes are amazing. You are going to want to re watch this film a couple of times, the action is so overwhelming and fun, your going to miss a lot. One thing I love about Avengers Age Of Ultron is the banter that goes on with the cast. It keeps you smiling throughout the film and the one liners stick with you for days.

As you know the cast is amazing and work spectacularly together so let's talk about the four new members. Aaron Taylor-Johnson who plays Quicksilver is funny and a bad ass while Elizabeth Olsen who is Scarlet Witch is more mysterious and spooky. These two work really well together as a brother sister team and balance each other really well and makes you want to see more of them. Paul Bettany who voices Jarvis finally makes his physical daybue as Vision. We don't get to see much of him but as with the rest of the cast he's funny, bad ass and we want to see more of Vision. Last but not least is Ultron, voiced by James Spader. I was thinking he was going to be more of a dark and scary villain. It turns out he's funny and lovable in a bad guy way. It makes sense because he is made from Tony Stark and as the movie goes on Ultron loses his charming self and turns into a evil mad man. This blend leaves you wanting more. I really enjoyed that Avengers Age Of Ultron focuses a bit more on the other Avengers like Hawkeye, Black Widow and Hulk, it really rounds out the universe and gave these characters a chance to shine.

Marvel Disney hit it out of the park once again and I kind of underestimated this film because of the first Avengers and Guardians of the Galaxy. I didn't think they could top those films, well Joss Whedon proved me wrong and is making it harder for me to write these Marvel reviews. From start to finish this film is a fun ride and doesn't feel like a 2 and a half hour long movie. Keep your eyes peeled for Stan Lee and SPOILER ALERT there is no end cutscene. Cheers and remember life won't suck as long as Joss Whedon keeps doing this amazing job.

Avengers Age of Ultron REVIEW by @KillFillm on Instagram,6 May 2015,,8
"Why are so many characters with lines listed as ""uncredited""",28 April 2015,"I love the film, and I love the complexity. I think the Agents of SHIELD ep just prior to the film's release needs to be seen before the film. I'm confused as to why on IMDb there are actors and actresses with lines in the film who are in the ""uncredited"" section. I will be watching this film dozens of times to look at ever piece that relates to the previous films, Agents of SHIELD, and upcoming stories. It would be nice if movie theaters would play the lead in (last two SHIELD episodes as a pre-film help or anyone who is lost at the beginning of the film). I'm a bit confused as to why Marvel is tying this film to ones coming out in 2017 and 2019 though,... that's very difficult to keep sorted.",10
"Impromptu Humor, Too Much Thick & Heavy Action, and Unsatisfying Characters New and Old",3 May 2015,"Being the sequel to the biggest superhero movie of all time is not an easy thing to be. Meeting the expectations and demands of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, of dedicated fans, and the general movie- going public is no easy task.

In an ambitious effort to top the previous Avengers movie, Joss Whedon packed around 5 different big-budget action sequences in Age of Ultron. The blockbuster action felt epic in the trailers and promos, but somehow lackluster in the actual movie (probably because we are bombarded with too much of it). Watching this superhero extravaganza, I felt that the filming style was gimmicky (camera turning around 360 to show way too many things going on at once).

Even with its 2 and a half hour run time, AoU has a rushed pace, and not enough time is given to the characters and audience to dwell on what is going on. There's so much ground to cover in this sequel that the movie struggles to find room. The movie glosses over the Scarlet Witch-induced hallucinations that the Avengers suffer, the ""Infinity Well"" (where Thor learns of setup for Phase 3 and the Infinity War), and the fact that SHIElD is back, but with no mention of the rival factions within it (shown on Agents Of SHIELD).

Everything and nothing is at stake in AoU. After all, it's obvious going into the theater that only one or two of our heroes will die-- because most of the Avengers have more movies that they're contracted to star in. Plus, Disney benefits far too much because of the MCU to kill off a money-making character. Knowing this, what is the point of making movies where the entire planet is in danger, yet not a single civilian gets killed on-screen and almost none of the Avengers are ever in real jeopardy? The comedic timing of the film is also off, as too many jokes and quips are made at inappropriate times, and this contributes to a lack of tension in the movie.

None of the acting is noteworthy or remarkable, but the conflict of ideologies between Tony and Cap was interesting to me and a natural progression of their characters (also setting up the two for Captain America 3: Civil War). I appreciated the camaraderie that the Avengers had in the Avengers Tower party scene, as it humanizes Earth's Mightiest Heroes. I personally didn't like the romantic relationship between Bruce and Natasha--none of the previous films, including this one, set them up as a couple--and yet they're talking about abandoning the team and running away together after defeating Ultron?

Bruce's inner demons are starting to feel tedious to watch, especially in the way it was handled. ***SPOILER ALERT*** He very unceremoniously leaves the team in a quinjet. And Natasha has now flirted (or at least had moments of romantic playfulness) with Tony, Cap, Hawkeye, and the Hulk. That seems kind of insulting to her character. (However, I do like that AoU delved into Black Widow's dark past.) Hawkeye gets some love, but I still don't think it was enough. (I don't even see why Black Widow and Hawkeye are main characters in the MCU, they're better off as major supporting characters. After all, they're fighting an army of robots and Hawkeye himself says that all he has is a bow and arrow!)

***SPOILER ALERT*** Of all the characters to kill off, the end of a recently introduced and supporting character is somewhat disappointing--especially how it was handled. We barely got time to be introduced to Quicksilver, but he is killed anyway. His final words are ""Bet you didn't see that coming"", but many had already predicted his death. (Was Quicksilver killed simply for shock effect, or because his character was too weak to compete against the one from X: Men DOFP?) The Vision, Quicksilver, and Scarlet Witch are all undeveloped (Scarlet Witch feels way too much like Carrie; from the horror movie).

Ultron is ""not as scary as the Winter Soldier, or as interesting and entertaining as Loki, or as ominous as hyper-intelligent Ava from Ex Machina."" He doesn't do anything actually useful with all of the power he supposedly has (no hacking, no using nukes?). AoU's Ultron is a far cry from the comics, where he's apparently a ""hyper- intelligent and adaptable being"". The father son relationship between Stark and Ultron that could have been, isn't. ""We aren't given any time for him and Stark to form a relationship that could later turn to hatred. There is never that process that allows us to accept Ultron first as Stark's 'child' and then as his antagonist."" Considering the love-hate relationship between Hank Pym and Ultron is a key part of his character in the comics (which I haven't read but know enough about), AoU is a letdown in that regard. (And the way he is defeated is pretty lame.)

Age of Ultron could've have definitely been a much better movie. Instead of leaving people wanting more, Joss Whedon has left most wanting less. The action gets too thick and makes the movie feel bloated; too many one-liners are said at impromptu times. Cap and Iron Man are the most interesting characters, but the rest fall flat. Whedon ""simply has too many balls to keep in the air for one movie—even a two-and-a-half-hour one."" In interviews, Whedon has said that he feels burned out by his responsibilities in the MCU. Therefore, him leaving the franchise is probably the best for all of us.

I have reviewed 40 movies (some on Metacritic and/or IMDb) including the 2014 and 2015 films: Fast & Furious 7, The Divergent Series: Insurgent, Taken 3 and more. I also review other TV shows, such as: Marvel's Daredevil, Agent Carter, Empire (2015), The Flash, Arrow (Season 3), Gotham, Marvel's Agents of SHIELD (Season 1 and 2), and more.",5

Age Of Ultron,1 May 2015,"You have to remember that almost each Avenger had their own sequel or was included in one, so this is like the climax of phase 2 of the MCU, but it wasn't like the last Hobbit film where is was all fighting. The movie about 3/5 of the time goes pretty fast, maybe a little too fast to collect your thoughts. Ultron is (Tiny spoiler) made almost 15 minutes into the movie. He is an awesome smart villain that didn't get the screen time he deserved. There is a lot of action, which is pretty overwhelming. But during the fast paced moments, the plot and character development is done pretty well. And Ultron is pretty well introduced. Now with the pros.The action is very well done. Hawkeye got the screen time and story he deserves. And personally I thought the Banner/Natasha relationship was fine. The Avengers get equal screen time. And the Vision and the twins were a great addition. And the Marvel human is there. All in all Age of Ultron is a great closing/climax to Phase 2 that does have a great villain that had it's injustices, a good and solid story that does move a little fast, Marvel surprises, humor, and fantastic characters.",10

*********************It will contain spoilers that is the truth**************,2 May 2015,,1
Good second part,23 July 2015,"The Avengers return together in the second installment of the Avengers film trilogy. Once again all the characters have to work together to overcome an enemy that threatens the whole word and once again we tie together all the individual plot lines from the solitary films.

And once again it works. It really works. I especially like how director Joss Whedon has had the courage and common sense to allow the characters to evolve. The team has already been built so it's a great time to focus on their camaraderie. And that's the heart and soul of this movie. It's fantastic to see all these great characters working together and even just hanging around. In fact they have a party near the beginning of the movie and it's easily one of the best scenes in the whole film.

The actors are still at the top of their game with Chris Evans and Robert Downey Jr. once again earning a special mention. They're the two personalities who define the franchise and I cannot wait for Captain America: Civil War for a chance to see them together once again. Furthermore, the special effects are still state of the art, the action scenes are exciting and the villain is also one of the best we've yet had, which is great because interesting villains have been the one thing that Phase Two movies have mostly lacked.

But yeah, it's not a perfect movie or as good as the first Avengers. Most of the areas that work, work as well as in the previous film, but there are a couple of things that are a bit rough around the edges. Like the side plot they give to Black Widow and Hulk. It's interesting, but it comes straight out of nowhere and thus we don't really have a chance to connect with it. I'm not against the idea itself, but the execution needs some work. Secondly, by this point the plot formula is starting to become somewhat transparent. And I like the formula, but I would like it to be tweaked just a bit more so that I couldn't predict the story so accurately from the first few minutes.

Ultimately what this means is that Avengers: Age of Ultron is a good film, but it doesn't come close to being the best we've yet seen. And truthfully, it was pretty unlikely that it was going to be. Second parts are hard to do because you still have to save something for the finale, yet you've already established the characters and all that. Nevertheless, Age of Ultron is more than worth a watch or two if you've like the franchise so far. Have no fear. It's good, great even.",8
I think that it's better than the first movie!,4 February 2022,"Even If it has a slow beginning and I've thought myself that I am not going to like it, personally it seems that this movie it's even better than its predecessor. Both ""Avengers"" are very good movies, not excellent, but both have plenty of action, great acting and nice special effects, only exception being the fact that this one felt a little bit more emotional than the first one. Also, the villain of this one seems to be much more interesting than the villain in the first movie, which is Thor's brother, Loki and his army of Chitauri. Ultron seems to be more threatening, because it's an artificial intelligence digital being, which has the constant ability to evolve and adapt. Even I've rated them both with 8, this movie deserves a rating of 8,5. Both are worth watching!",8
Avengers Assembled to take on Ultron,23 July 2015,"Earth's Mightiest heroes reunite once again to save the world from Ultron (voiced by James Spader), a self conscious A.I. hell bent on eradicating humanity.

Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen), Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and Vision (Paul Bettany) have been added to the already existing superhero roster, adding some much needed firepower to take down Ultron.

The action sequences are quite spectacular, especially the one with an out of control Hulk and Iron Man (with his Hulkbuster suit), enough to leave the fan boys thrilled. The ending of course is literally out of this world as the Avengers have to contend with a falling Sokovia plummeting Earth as well as Ultron and his countless robot minions.

Hawkeye gets some character development introducing the audience to his family living in a remote cabin in the woods (get it). Banner and Black widow have a few scenes opening up to each other filling, some emotional depth of the movie.

The movie however does have a few plot holes that were left unexplained. At the end of Iron Man3 Tony Stark decides to quit being Iron Man, yet here he is in all his glory. A few jokes could have also been left out as it desensitized any tension or suspense.

Joss Whedon does an admirable job in making a consistent summer blockbuster. Cool CGI, fun one-liners, good performances and average plot is become somewhat of a template that most Hollywood movies seem to follow. I feel that Marvel should have tried to do something different as I was left wanting something a bit more. Age of Ultron is still an enjoyable film and will definitely entertain those who are just in for a good time.",8
"2015, is the year to watch out for in terms of Hollywood movies for sequels and ending of franchisees.",7 May 2015,"2015, is the year to watch out for in terms of Hollywood movies for sequels and ending of franchisees.

This year every possible genre has covered from Action, Thriller, and Romance to Horror, Science fiction and Comedy.

December 2014 ended with Ben Stiller's' final comedy historic genre – Night in the Museum-3 in, 2015 began with Liam Neeson's Taken 3, and in the month of February was added the spice of Romance and Love through the 50 Shades of Grey, where one saw the introduction of Dakota Johnson.

The Fast and Furious legacy continued into its 7th Edition, emotions taking over with what one saw in the final clips, some inspiring monologues by the Lead protagonist Vin Diesel in the remembrance of late Paul Walker.

Tony Stark, Steve Rogers, Bruce Banner return as the ' Avengers' to fight a new villain- Ultron. Professor 'X' will be back in 2016 as the X-Men fight another battle for survival.

To top it all, we will see the return of Hans Solo, Luke Skywalker in the Star Wars VII- The force awakens, a continuation of the saga created by George Lucas set thirty years after Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi (1983).

Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) and team take on their most impossible mission yet, eradicating the Syndicate - an International rogue organization as highly skilled as they are, committed to destroying the IMF, as MI-5 returns for one final blast.

If there is action, can our good old Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) be left behind as, After finding himself in a new time-line, Kyle Reese teams up with John Connor's mother Sarah and an aging terminator to try and stop the one thing that the future fears, ""Judgment Day"" so in a new plot wee see the genesis of the Terminator.

If there is Science fiction, there are superhuman abilities, so the fantastic four make an appearance. In 1993, began a fantasy, a fiction when Steven Spielberg took us into the world of Dinosaurs. After 22 years with fresh faces and better technology with a rejuvenated plot, he returns again with Jurassic World making us look into the belly of the beast once again.

Horror movies have always literally been a hair-raising experience, so return the Conjuring -2 and insidious chapter 3 to make us go sleepless into the night.

So are we all set for a entertaining and captivating 8 months.

a Big disappointment,24 April 2015,"The First Movie was way better, it had a soul and a thrill that made the entire package exiting, this second movie is all flash and no bang, Thrills are constantly interrupted by forced humor and it all feels pretty fake, no chance for immersion as the movie is too busy to finish and then start a third movie. Plus the Subtitles cover 1/3rd of the Screen which spoils the point of watching the movie in the Theatre(this is only an issue in India). Wait for DVD or Blu Ray, this is not as spectacular as the First one was, this is just made because they had earned the money to spare and wanted earn more money to spare, doesn't really take forward the Avengers anywhere or make you feel like you're part of the Movie, the so called dark theme and good reviews are just for the Hype, Don't fall for the Hype",1

surpasses the original in my opinion,19 September 2016,"I liked this sequel more than the original.as usual there is a ton of intense action sequences.it's also a very funny movie and once again the acting is as good as or better than in the original.there are also a few more marvel characters dropped into the mix.but the one thing that makes this film superior to the first(in my opinion,anyway)is the villain Ultron.this is one of the best villains to come along in the last few years.he is certainly a worthy adversary to the Avengers.Havin James Spader voice the character was a stroke of genius,in my mind.his voice just fits the character so well.overall,an excellent film.so far,Marvel is winning the superhero sweepstakes against DC,for two very important reasons.firstly,humour,second a relatively lighter tone.DC films tend to be dark and bleak.until DC figures this out,they will continue to lose ground to Marvel.this is just my opinion of course.anyway,for me Avengers: Age of Ultron is a 9/10",9

Don't Understand The Hate,30 June 2020,,8
Avengers return,25 June 2015,"The first Avengers film was a fun popcorn film, it helped that it had a fiendishly fun villain in Loki.

Age of Ultron begins in the middle of an action sequence with all the Avengers assembled and it is the first of several prolonged action scenes in the film. It reminded me of Man of Steel, a lot of wanton destruction in one film which just becomes dull after a while.

The plot, Tony Stark uses Loki's sceptre to kick-start an artificial intelligence peacekeeping programme that he has tried to develop for some time. Even though Bruce Banner warns him several times not to mess around with the power of the sceptre, Banner then goes on to help Stark. The end result is the formation of Ultron who decides that it is the human race that needs to be destroyed and kick-start a new earth that would be peaceful.

So in between the wisecracks including an ill judged Latin gag it is Iron Man's recklessness that causes the chaos. Captain America is still an overgrown boy scout, there is a bolt out of the blue growing love affair between the Black Widow and Bruce Banner which comes across as unconvincing as the scenes where they tried to hide Scarlett Johansson's bump as she was pregnant in real life at the time of the shooting, hence why she is the bar woman for the night in that party scene.

It is Hawkeye who is more fleshed out in this film and delivers a more human dimension to the plot.

Of course along with the main plot we have a whole host of subplots thrown into the mix including more superheroes and villains. So we have the Falcon dropping by, Quicksilver, the Scarlet Witch and the formation of a new Avengers team by the end of it.

The film tries to do too much and looks like a film made by committee and lacks the personal vision which elevated Captain America: The Winter Soldier last year.",5
A solid movie,23 May 2021,"I think Age of Ultron is a good Marvel film.

But certainly not one of the best.

For example the characters Quicksilver and Ultron were a disappointment and could have been much better written.

But all in all I really enjoyed it at had fun.",8
LOVED IT!,9 January 2019,"Amazing, just amazing! Marvel ate its best. The hulk is great",10
"""There is only one path to peace... your extinction.""",14 May 2015,"Ever since the coming of Marvel's Avengers, the world has not been the same. In the real world, the film set the gold standard for how to pull off the cinematic-universe model of filmmaking, and it did so with such iconic status that it'll remain a landmark for generations young and old. Within the universe Marvel created, the Avengers opened up the Earth to staggering possibilities of war with god-like entities from other worlds. Since then, the events of Iron Man 3, Thor: The Dark World, and Captain America: The Winter Soldier would cut the strings off of the Avengers team and force them to face a new challenge on their own.

The film immediately kicks off with a destructive brawl in Sokovia, where the Avengers come pre-assembled to pummel the hell out of a Hydra base. In the process, they run across more superpowered villains, and a stark vision of a dismal future. This leads to the rise of Ultron, a new breed of villain that actively splits the team apart from the inside out. The Avengers fight themselves, quite literally in a few scenes, including a chaotic sequence between the Hulk and Iron Man. They come together in the end for one lengthy climax that pits them against a whole army of machines, while the fate of the world hangs in the balance. With all of this going on, it goes without saying that there's definitely loads of superpowered action to behold. At the same time, the film is careful to keep things lightweight with bursts of witty banter and humor.

The story strikes me as being a grade more mature than the last Avengers film, which was little more than an alien invasion that prompted heroes to band together. Now, it's a robotpocalypse that threatens to tear the team apart; in spite of that, the characters are explored a little more in-depth, often with surprising insights into each characters' strengths and weaknesses. Not every viewer will enjoy the sudden relationship between Bruce Banner and Natasha Romanoff (and I agree that it's rather weird; she was practically afraid of the guy in the first film). Also, not every viewer will find Ultron a striking villain - he is not necessarily menacing like Ronan or a ""bad guy we love to hate"" the way Loki is - but I found him interesting and nuanced, especially as a ""child"" of Tony Stark who inherits some of his same traits, which gives him a twisted sense of purpose. Through Ultron and his motivations, the film unearths strong themes of evolution and the progress of mankind; themes that were common in the X-Men, but were rather implicit in the other Marvel films up to now. Parallels are blatantly drawn between Ultron and Pinocchio, but I couldn't help but to compare Ultron to V'Ger from Star Trek: The Motion Picture - they are both ""child-like"" intelligences that threaten mankind and strive for evolution, but while V'Ger meant no harm in the end, Ultron exudes hostility and angst beneath his playful sarcasm, and I think that makes him more remarkable. In spite of these insights, I thought the film's story was quite intriguing. Ultron's diabolical plot gives the Avengers team a twisty mystery and a larger-than-life spectacle, which might strain logic in a few places, but it also leads the characters into different directions by the end.

The film boasts pretty good photography. It tends to be very choppy and shaky in the action scenes, much unlike the first film, which felt much more smooth and solid. However, this film does have some good-looking shots. Color schemes are notably darker and more drab. Editing can be rather choppy. Acting is fine for what it is: Chris Evans, Robert Downey Jr., Mark Ruffalo, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, and Samuel L. Jackson are as enjoyable to watch as ever. James Spader breathes life into Ultron superbly. Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen are pretty good in their roles, and there are a few welcome cameos by Don Cheadle, Ibris Elba, Stellan Skarsgard, and Anthony Mackie. Writing is pretty decent. This production spares no expense on the sets, props, costumes, and special effects; it all looks a grade more polished and more real than the first film. The music score by Bryan Tyler and Danny Elfman reprises the same themes that Alan Silvestri introduced, but also contributes some strong compositions throughout the picture.

Avengers: Age of Ultron delivers bigger action, with an intriguing story that gives the titular team a more desperate fight. I don't think it's quite as breezy as the first film, and I find the first film's action scenes easier on the eyes. If you're following the Marvel movies, however, this is the apex of Phase 2, and it's worth the time.

Pretty much as Good as The First,12 May 2015,,8
Another 200 plus million Whedon Self Indulgence porn fest.,8 March 2017,"The assembled Avengers cinematic universe, as well as each character's standalone film(s) is intended as an homage to a long standing property, fore fronting entertainment and nostalgia above substance and development. That is not detrimental by any means, some of the best products of entertainment have followed the same formula and found incredible and justified success. What Whedon has done with both of the assembled outings though did not qualify in this category at all. I am aware that he has achieved that untouchable-nerdy godlike status that allows him the ""creative"" liberties to now assemble juggernaut films like Avengers Assemble and Age of Ultron, where the eye-candy mind-numbing loud-chaos inter-cut with snide comments, punchlines and one-liners aiming at posterity are force fed on audiences. Considering then that we're not expected to be watching a film with the narrative complexity that Nolan has granted Batman trilogy, we wouldn't have expected such thin, lazy and pedestrian treatment. The characters that previously were given little to no room to develop are now treated to clichéd and forced subplots, the setup and motivations are as tired and laughable as it goes and the required comedic relief is so forced and bland that it is widely cringing. Even so, Whedon somehow manages to go through the motions requiring an almost impossible sense of suspension of disbelief, even for comic book standards and plot holes you could walk an elephant through.

All his might seem a contradictory coming from a self-proclaimed summer blockbuster superhero film fan. It might even seem more contradictory review coming from a huge X-Men, a fan that manages to somehow find redeeming qualities and saving graces in the weakest entries (and there are nine of them). The case with The Avengers franchise though is that an already overcrowded ensemble unites for sequels upon sequels, not to mention their own parallel trilogies that also include mini reunions of sorts, with absolutely no originality or saving grace other than the massive wide spectacle of worldwide destruction. Call it cynicism, call it incoherence. I call it overgrowing exhaustion with this franchise.",2
Avengers: Age of Ultron Review,9 September 2016,"Avengers: Age of Ultron(2015) Starring Robert Downey JR. Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, Jeremy Renner, Scarlett Johansson, Mark Ruffalo, Elizabeth Olsen, Araon- Taylor Johnson, Cobie Smulders, Don Cheadle, Paul Bettany, James Spader, Samuel Jackson, Andy Serkis, Hayley Atwell, Stellan Skarsgård, Idris Elba, and Anthony Mackie Directed By: Joss Whedon Review You all have waited since it's announcement, since the other five phase two films were completed and now the time has come for the sequel to one of the biggest films in history Marvel's Avengers:Age of Ultron is here! And it's glorious, a wonder to behold but it's missing one thing. The Film sees earth's mightiest heroes assemble again as Tony Stark creates a peace-keeping program known as Ultron that eventually turns on him believing that the only way to save mankind is to destroy it. Now the assembled team must stop the out of control robot in order to save mankind. We also see the return of some of other favorite side characters such as Maria Hill, Falcon, War Machine, Heimdall, Eric Selvig and some new characters like Quicksilver and Scarlett witch. James Spader he was born to play Ultron, he owns this role. The relationship between Bruce Banner and Black Widow is by far a great edition that hope continues for the next time we see these two characters on screen together. Giving them traits in common, explores Black Widow's past and giving them a romance that is incredibly believable. Hawkeye has a much larger part of this film and that is my favorite thing about this movie because he is my favorite Avenger and I hope I see him in Infinity Wars. Everyone has talked to death about the casts chemistry from the first film and that same chemistry is still here, there's no need for me talk about it. I love the new characters of Scarlett Witch and Quicksilver and I'm glad they got these two actors to portray them, they would have been my first choices. The only down side to this movie is that their were a lot of things cut from this movie but it still manages to be one of the best superhero films I have ever seen. It will never beat Spider-Man 2 though. Also the Iron Man situation with him quitting by the end of the third film was quite possibly one of the many things cut from the film but, like in the first film that be rectified in dialogue with him creating the peace keeping program so he doesn't have to be Iron Man. All in all people keep saying Guardians of The Galaxy is the best film from this universe which while I do think its great I don't think it's better then all of the others except Iron Man 3 and 2. This sequel manages to still have great depth, action, humor, and characters to make it great fun. I'm giving Avengers: Age of Ultron a five out of five.",10
What a marvel is - to be human,20 June 2017,"This movie is very interesting. There are many critical comments about this movie because of the attempt Marvel has made - to show the human part of superheroes.

Little spoilers ahead)

This is not the usual Avengers thing..more like X-Men story )This is much more deeper - the family of Hawkeye... moments of romance between Natasha and Bruce. Even the compassion I think many of us can feel to Pietro and Wanda..This is a very beautiful movie because of these moments.

The best scene of the movie was the family of Hawkeye, - the only shelter of Avengers... and Clint Barton finally had a very deep and great part of the team here ... I love this movie exactly because of it - no superheroes but just humans like us... the message is very good.

P.S. And Scarlett is amazing like always)) the more I watch Avengers movies the more I feel sorry for Bruce and want them to be together. Mark Ruffalo is very good and convincing)))",8

Avengers: Age of Ultron is wonderful,29 May 2021,"The story is interesting and well written. The acting is on point. Some scenes were perfectly done, like the party scene. The villains in this movie were okay. What drags this movie down for me are unnecessary jokes in some scenes, but some of the humor was really good.",9

"Could not be Happier with this Darker, More Thrilling Sequel,",1 May 2015,"Avengers: Age of Ultron is an outstanding movie with a very well developed plot and a superb cast. I know that many people will probably disagree with me, but I feel like this movie did everything right in terms of serving as a sequel to the original Avengers, it took the characters in to darker, more severe territories, which was a wise choice. Joss Whedon knew what he was doing and did not go the same route as many sequels do, by playing it safe and using many elements merely because they worked out well in the first movie. The cast are all still in good form, Robert Downey Jr. is of course the star of the show once again as Tony Stark, I also loved the new characters who are played very well by Elizabeth Olsen, Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Paul Bettany. James Spader is terrifying as Ultron, a terrific villain who felt necessary for this sequel, as he is a step up from Loki, a great warm up before the Avengers: Infinity War. It's well written, the cast are all in great form and it kept me at the edge of my seat throughout, I would recommend Avengers: Age of Ultron to all moviegoers, particularly Marvel fans, you will certainly be impressed.

After a machine built by Stark and Banner to help the Avengers protect the world turns villainous, it is up to the Avengers to save the world from a robot powerful enough to destroy them all.

Best Performance: Robert Downey Jr.",9
Age of Ultron manages an impressive feat - being even better than The Avengers,1 May 2015,"Avengers: Age of Ultron already assumes that the audience is familiar with superheroes, who they are, and what they can do. After all, a film with a genetic beast, spies, a billionaire vigilante, a God, and a super soldier kinda already demands you assume this is a universe of the fantastic.

After raiding the last of the evil Hydra's headquarters, the Avengers stumble on the last remnants of secret technology that Stark uses to create artificial intelligence, Ultron, in order to protect the world from future conflicts that the Avengers could not face alone. Unfortunately, after gaining sentience in Stark's rush to exploit the tech before being whisked away to Thor's home world of Asgard (land of Norse Gods), Ultron commences an attack on the Avengers, which slowly starts looking more like an attack on mankind after he starts gaining more perspective on life, though his real motivations remain mysterious for the majority of the film. Tagging along are Pietro and Wanda Maximoff - experimented twins who team with Ultron who have a personal vendetta against the Avengers. It's up to the Avengers in a globe sprawling adventure to stop Ultron before his plans come to fruition.

First, I have to say that the first Avengers is a mad feat of complexity as an ensemble film - giving enough time and personal arcs for each character to make a cohesive whole from everyone's story. With Age of Ultron, things are ratcheted up to 11 as character stories seamlessly flow in-and-out of a labyrinth of a narrative. I feel like this movie will become even better with repeat showings as character beats and story revelations will become more enriched with hindsight of where they lead to.

Characters who got the short end of the stick in the last film in terms of screen-time, like Romanov and Barton, are given particularly more story to enjoy as most of the other characters deal with one form or another of the choices they've made and where they choose to proceed in terms of the world they want to leave behind. Never in my life would I think that a superhero film would more ponderous about the impermanence of life, the concept of immortality, and moral pragmatism than Age of Ultron. In a film that could have been so easily tempted to streamline story elements, writer/director Joss Whedon crafts a story that demands an attentive mind to examine every piece of dialog, story beat, and (yes) even joke to bring a holistic view of a grand superhero story. It's mature without falling into being lethargically dour, grandiose without being just an empty light-show, and uplifting without being simple-minded about it. Great acting, snappy dialog, deep thematic content, and terrific action scenes make Age of Ultron the gold to which not only every superhero film will be judged by, but every film that identifies itself as a blockbuster. It's not merely a stopping point for a dull viewer to enjoy as they wait for the sequel, but a fascinating perspective on humanity as a whole.

The Avengers show the world (and the audience) that at the end of the day, their job (or responsibility depending on who you ask) is to protect people, and while there will always be disagreements as to how to accomplish it, there's no question that these people with the ability to change the world will always answer the call.",10
absolutely awful.,28 April 2015,"This movie, sadly, falls victim of its own hype. i was soooooo wanting this movie to be a great sequel to the original Avengers, and it falls flat on its face.

Andy Serkis, plays a character, who says about 3 lines, and is in the movie for the best part of 90 seconds, his part should have been enlarged, or written out. The story felt cobbled together, as did the story telling, and for its part made no sense, ie. the finale is seriously flat, and how Ultron came about is explained in about 5 lines in a short scene, that again, could have built up more tension. There is a plethora of gags, ala ""buddy cop"" style, and i had to check i wasn't watching Lethal Weapon with Riggs and Murtagh instead! Luckily, the movie has some great eye candy, but its all sum, and no substance, the movie lasts for 2.5 hours, but in all that time the story was hurried along, with no depth. There isn't much character development with the new guys, and as to why Red Witch and Qicksilver are even there, makes no sense, and is explained poorly.

This movie is no better than say, Iron Man II, and that is feint praise indeed, the flick flatters to deceive the viewer from the off, and its true that the action is non stop, and hits the ground running, but the price paid for the constant tempo, is a lack of quality, that is sadly obvious, that the first movie had it in bucket loads.

If you're a youngster you will love this movie, if you a more mature, discerning fan of the genre, then you will be left wanting. Joss Wheddon was quoted as saying this was the hardest thing in his life to get over the line, believe me it shows.

Wait for the bluray, this is a big flop, from start to finish.

gutted.",3
Must have seen a different movie,2 May 2015,"It sounds like most of the people who reviewed this movie didn't care much for it. I don't know if I'm abnormally easy to please (I certainly don't think so) but I loved this movie. I thought it was fantastic. I thought the humor that was present throughout the movie was true to the characters and added some personality to what could have been a very dark & dreary movie. I thought that there were some great small moments of character development (let's be honest, we can't be expecting every one of the dozen main characters on screen to undergo a dramatic personal growth in this type of ensemble effort) and there is just enough of a story (not a complicated one) to bring the impressive action sequences together nicely. In fact I think one of the strengths of the movie was the character interactions/dialog. I'm admittedly a fan of the way Joss does that in just about all of his projects (I know some are not) but the little hints (some subtle, some not) & moments of reading in between the lines does a lot more character development than some want to give credit for. If I were to judge by the theater's reaction, everyone seemed to come out of auditorium thoroughly impressed. There was laughter, gasps, oohs and ahhs all throughout the movie I'm sure there are some folks who genuinely didn't like parts of this movie, but it seems that at least some of these bad reviews are coming from kids who are just too cool for school. I thought Joss did a great job and that in many ways Age of Ultron was the equal to and in some moments surpassed the first movie. I had read some of the reviews before seeing the film and was resigning myself to maybe being disappointed or the movie not living up to my own expectations. I ended up loving every second of it. I felt like a kid in a candy shop for 2.5 hours and couldn't find a bad thing to say. I guess everyone has a different take on it, had different expectations for what sort of movie it would be or what the characters would be doing... but I for one, couldn't recommend this movie any higher.",10
The New Age is Epic !,27 April 2015,"As the third phase begins in the billion dollar Marvel Cinematic universe, there was always the feeling that the sequel to 'The Avengers' would be a let down. The dream movie of 2012 was the ultimate superhero experience, bringing together a collection of superheroes who had been so brilliantly built up over the previous four years. What could the sequel do to add to that experience? The answer is a lot and much of it unexpected, managing to exceed expectations and bring the Marvel world into a new era. This movie sees the superheroes once again battling an enemy so powerful that their own weaknesses become apparent and the introduction of new members to the elite force make the mix even more compelling. The cast were as great as ever and so familiar in their respective outfits and persona's but it's the additional superheroes that add flavour to this epic sequel. The inclusion of another female superhero, with the brilliant Elizabeth Olsen playing 'Scarlet Witch' seemed to steal the show and bring some much needed darkness to the Marvel world. The bar only gets higher and the ride even better ! @zulfmanauthor",10
Great movie. All the haters need to quit.,1 May 2015,"This is a great movie in my opinion. I looked at reviews last night after watching this movie, and I was surprised to see how many people were posting negative reviews of this movie. While this movie may have similarities to the first movie that some are complaining about there is also a lot that changed also. The saying that goes something like ""If it isn't broken, don't fix it"" can apply to some parts of this movie which is a good thing. To the people are saying that its the same ol' type of action movie and are disappointed, I think you are looking too deep into and expect too much. Not every sequel has to be completely different then the first movie of any series. I feel that people are also giving it bad reviews because they are the close minded type who always think the first of any series is the best and no sequel is better. I think people should be open minded when they see this to truly see how good it is. In fact I am going to most likely watch it a second time in theaters!",10

"Entertaining and fun, but could be better",3 May 2015,,5
Age of Ultron is by far my favorite MCU movie (tied with the original Avengers of course),22 November 2015,"On the 29th of April 2015, my brother and I went to see this highly anticipated movie. I would give it an 8.2-8.5 out of 10. Those who say that this movie didn't live up to the hype are idiots. It is witty with its one liners, it is jaw-dropping with its visuals and action sequences and is awesome because we get to see new Avengers (Vision, Scarlet Witch, Quicksilver etc.), Hulk vs. Hulkbuster, a villain who is just as good as Loki and a team fighting together with no boring bits or overrated scenes, like in the first Avengers movie. Those who disagree with me are spoiled fan boy haters who cannot see greatness in front of them. It is tied with the first Avengers movie as my favorite MCU movie and tied as my favorite movie of 2015 with Mad Max: Fury Road. I disagree with IMDb and believe that this movie is at least 8.2/10. Those fan boy haters are tied in their own strings of hate and impossible anticipations. There are no strings on me.",8
"watch it, query 3d necessary",15 May 2015,"Worth watching, enjoyed it, lots of action scenes and fighting that the 3D seemed to fail and take away from the movie, in fact the 3d did not add and might of subtracted from the movie. SO I am planning to re watch it later when it comes out on DVD in 2d.

I loved how it seems to be linking in other marvel movies and I am looking forward to see how the next one picks up and how this will link in with the next Thor movie. Love the scene with Stan lee. My wife and I compare it very favourable against the other avengers movies. If you felt let down by any of the previous ones this could maybe restore your faith.

Although I hope you choose wisely whether to watch it first in 3D or 2D, choose your own destiny, thank you marvel and all involved in the movie.",9

A must see at the cinema!,25 April 2015,"I am a very big fan of Marvel and their films, they can hardly do wrong sometimes. I was skeptical at first thinking perhaps Age of Ultron would be a downfall in the franchise but I was very much mistaken. I really enjoyed this film from start to finish. I thought that at some point Marvel have to make a bad movie, this may come with Ant-Man later this year but not with this movie.

The story great with a balance between what is best for humanity and the world which Is a lot different than trying to conquer New York from the last movie. With an actual good Marvel Villain arguably since Loki, Ultron voiced by James Spader was excellent. The two new additions in the Maximoff brother and sister was really good to see that Marvel can add new characters that slot straight in. In fact loved all the new characters ones which I will not mention for spoilers.

For anyone wanting a new great marvel movie this is it, anyone want a great movie in general this is it. Watching it on the big screen is a must. Loved the movie.",8
Definitely a Great Sequel,25 April 2015,"Being one of the most anticipated movie of 2015 Avengers: Age of Ultron done a great job keeping its fans more entertaining. This sequel i would say a perfect one. From beginning to end lot of funny scenes are there. visual effects are outstanding. one of the best scene From this movie was the iron man vs hulk fighting scene. The way iron man punches hulk's face was quite hilarious. The script was funny,every character Has equal importance and they played it well . I really enjoyed the romance between Bruce and Natasha. Scarlet Witch & Quicksilver did a great job with avengers.

Though the plot was not a great improvement over the past one but the visual effects & bunch of funny scenes never let the avengers fans Unsatisfied.",9
This one is underrated,15 May 2020,"I think Avengers age of Ultron is underrated , very brilliant movie with good philosophy .",9
"Strings...Strings...Strings...""There are no strings on me""...",29 April 2015,"Summer is upon us and you know what that means..Holy Grail Avengers...the most anticipated movie of the year has arrived and I am drinkin'it..this movie is awesome, it's a rock concert comic book slam back through from start to finish.Fun is the keyword here because this movie has not left any comic book pages left and come up in the big screen..right from the opening action sequence through everything.

It has dark moments like they showed in the trailers, it gets even darker then the first avengers but it kept that same sense of humour..the jokes work so well that you go from jokes to action back to jokes, it's like the new character ""Quicksilver""..as fast he is zipping around that's what this movie does a good joke then a great action sequence.

The relation between the avengers is taken to a next level, their chemistry is great and there is so much character development especially of ""Hawkeye"" and ""Black Widow"". Captain America was as cool as he has been..new comers Quicksiler and Scarlet Witch were pretty good too.

The avengers face the new baddie - ""Ultron"" voiced by James Sapder.. who is hands down one of the most awesome villain ever...""Period"". He is menacing, dangerous,Master of manipulator, charming and funny but in a very sadistic way, he just deliver's monologues after monologues and that makes him more and more convincingly evil. I Loved Ultron as the villain.

Then you get to see ""The Vision"" who is Jarvis who really added a lot to this film..He gets one of the infinity stones(Mind Stone)..and gets the ultimate power. His character shows so much equality of the human existence and choosing sides.

There were bits in the film that bummed me out where i was like why that scene has to be in the film.

And the End Credit scene is amazing..where ""Thanos"" comes in and says I'll do it myself..and grabs the Infinity Gauntlet glove..woah..now we will see him in Avengers:Infinity War part 1 in (2018) & part 2 in (2019). Joss Whedon does a great job in making this movie.

Finally Avengers:Age Of Ultron is........ - ""AWESOMETACULAR""..!!",9
"Just Your Typical Mindless, Juvenile Action Flick Piece Of Trash",8 June 2015,"Just what you could expect. A tiresomely frenetic, needlessly violent and mindless yawn of an actioner with cardboard characters, endless overdone special effects and a $29.95 script.

The storyline was moronic and the acting sucked. Robert Downey, Jr. was particularly lame, a master of two on-screen emotions.

Because I was working this event, I got to sit through it twice in one day. In 3-D. Once would have been more than enough.

No wonder these big-budget, so-called ""blockbusters"" are such box office bombs these days. They bite it big time the first time or two out as a franchise, and then become even more ridiculous and unwatchable as new installments are puked out. What kind of morons bankroll this type of crap? Really?",2
Iron Man steals the show...,24 April 2015,"Yes ! Expectations were way too high, being fortunate that it released in India among selected countries, a week earlier than the rest. thanks to the distribution houses. The Marvel-Disney joined together will rule the superhero industry has been proved again. It's obvious to compare a sequel from the last one. So this time, the movie is less comic, and more action, lots of action. And this time, the team has grown bigger than the last one, the only problem is next time, the justification of screen appearance.

The script writers have totally justified the story about what kind of super-villain will they need, although there were stuff you want to know how it happened but the pace of the movie doesn't gives you the chance to sink in the think,

Iron man, stood as the captain of the team, so yes he is everywhere in the movie, Hulk and Bruce, both of them gave a noticeable part, and as usual. You do miss Nick fury and SHIELD in this one. Thor was there and Captain America was negligible for me. Only there for killing and action,

Quicksilver not as enjoyable as X-Men: Days of the future past, and Scarlett witch was superb.

So the question is, as I said in the start, expectations were too high, so does it meet the expectation...?

Definitely, make sure not to miss this one....",9
Very Exciting and Fun,17 May 2015,,9
I'm not a die hard fan of comic book movies BUT...,16 May 2015,"*minimum spoiler*

I don't get all the bad reviews about this film. I went to opening night IMAX 3D. Everyone had a great time. People laughed, they cheered, they clapped. I am not a die hard super hero fanatic but I really enjoyed this film. It sustained a 2+ hour time frame and I never felt bored. There are some beautiful scenes such as the beginning of the film when they are all fighting next to each other as well as the scene at the core area. It was some of the best cgi/slow motion I've ever watched. I also really enjoyed the party scene. The humor was fun and right on for a marvel superhero movie so I'm not understanding the criticism. I loved all the characters, even the bad guy...This is great entertainment if you like this sort of movie. Yes, plot lines are important but what you need in a movie like this is fun, witty dialogue and kicking ass and it delivers!",9
Age Of Ultron,27 May 2015,,10
Joss Whedon is the worst sell out in cinema history,26 April 2015,"This film is OK if you are a michael bay fan

if you can turn your brain off, and not think (in other words if you are a conservative in America) this movie is great fluff

everyone else will ghate this mess

why?

whats the point of a villain if hulk can one shot him

why call it avengers, why not hulk does stuff

hulk can do almost anything

except try to look interested in scarlet Johansen

and you know, there must be a superhero at work, because it takes super powers for anyone to give her an acting job

her voice is nasally she looks old and fat she cant act why does she get any screen time, i don't know

Thor is supposed to be a god. he gets jobbed out as some fret boy douche bag in every avengers film

PG 13 waters this turd down to almost urine levels of awful

hulk goes crazy and rampages in the city

NOT A SINGLE PERSON GETS HURT

why bother at this point with the hulk dynamic, he wont ever hurt anyone, the biggest problem with hulk is PG13- ruins any tension because you know he wont hurt anyone

RDJ phones it in, he looks bored by this point, his ego is too big to share screen time with B listers

evans as cap is good, but they give him so little to work with- hes literally got no story arc, hes john cena, hes mr nice guy, he has no personality, no depth, hes a kitten with a frisby

ultron is awful as a villain

i think whedon is a hack, he cant do this kind of thing justice

don't waste your time with this film, wait until they show it free on live TV

you're not missing anything that wasn't in the first avengers",1
The most satisfying superhero movie experience in years,3 May 2015,"I want to start off by asking this of everyone who thinks the first movie was superior: can you name one thing that Age of Ultron didn't improve on? Now this is certainly just one man's opinion, but I felt Whedon proved his ability once again to handle nearly a dozen superheroes on the screen together with ease. The fight sequences were thrilling and they showed us more of the Avengers working together despite their differences in methods and ideals. I laughed much more than I had anticipated (""Iron Man: Go to sleep, go to sleep, go to sleep"") and the moments of calm provided not only comic relief but some elements of well executed and genuine emotion. In fact, Hawkeye steals the show in multiple scenes, which was satisfying to watch after he was under-used in the first film. Of course, Age of Ultron is by no means flawless but so rarely does a movie come this close to perfection. I was slightly underwhelmed by the main villain Ultron who, while charismatic, never came across as being especially menacing. But this can be overlooked as all the heroes bring their collectively impressive acting talent and charm to every single scene. Even the brief mid-credits scene left me in awe because it reveals what is in store for the next two Avengers movies and what is in store for the future looks very exciting.",8
Worthy sequel to Avengers,30 April 2015,"""Everyone creates the thing they dread"", claims Ultron as he corroborates his emergence as a formidable adversary to the Avengers. A by-product of the Iron Legion from Iron Man 3, Ultron is an unhinged opponent initially created by Tony Stark to maintain accord. A physical manifestation of the detriment the team can cause, the AI goes awry and vows to ensure mankind's doom.

A sequel to the blockbuster behemoth The Avengers, the monolithic feature is massive in scope and epic in scale, an immersive experience best served in IMAX. Writer-director Joss Whedon is assigned the unenviable task of essentially culminating another phase of movies. The unlikely champion of the original, he is able to repeat the trick.

He excels at dabbling with a huge ensemble and crafting an intriguing premise, which merges multiple narratives into a singular, uniform anecdote. While the progression for each character is logical, new introductions are carried out seamlessly as well.

The usual suspects return in fine form and the new additions further supplement proceedings. Equilibrium is struck between all characters, each given their moment to shine. The female contingent is typified by Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) in another authentic depiction and Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen), one half of a destructive duo with deviant abilities. Other pieces of the jigsaw include Vision (Paul Bettany), an android with fascinating strength. Furthermore, the titular foe is memorable and mesmerizing. Biblical in speech and imposing in ideas, Ultron is inherently unstable and views human beings as a plague worth decimating. Television veteran James Spader is an inspired choice to voice the sentient robot. The only qualm in his portrayal is that there isn't enough of Ultron on screen.

Although it consists of the requisite fireworks, the personal and intimate character moments render it more profound than generic action fare. While set pieces fade from memory, characters always endure. The chemistry between a charismatic cast and tender moments shared by their characters are what render the movie its soul. At its nucleus, it contains several intertwined smaller stories which are heartfelt and sincere.

The subject matter is also sporadically divergent in nature. New players upset the status quo and expose the soft core of the team. The group is forced to contend with friction and conflicts among themselves.

In terms of production value, cinematography is supremely executed: the visual aesthetic is excellent. A couple of one-shot sequences of the heroes in motion are supremely exquisite. Action is always in abundance, with an epic confrontation between Hulk and Iron Man's Hulkbuster armor the highlight.

A prevailing modus operandi for Marvel, the plot is laden with references to past and present events. While certain nods tie in to previous films, others tease forthcoming developments. As opposed to being shoehorned, the seeds are sown with finesse. The follow-up also contains several unforeseen surprises in store for viewers. An explosion of color and celebration of comic books, the film features an onslaught of mayhem at a whirlwind pace. Age of Ultron merges several genres such as action, drama, comedy and romance, which is likely to appease enthusiasts and pedestrian movie goers alike.",8
Amazing sequel that isn't better but isn't any worse!,7 July 2015,"I honestly do not see why there are some people who bash this movie. This deserves higher than a 7.9 on IMDb! I have been as long as I've lived a Marvel fan, and know what is good and what is not. Avengers: Age of Ultron does not disappoint for that matter, lol i saw earlier some review that said this movie was bland........you're kidding me right?! Action packed right out of the gate, and keeping it fresh with the new villain Ultron, and other new characters. The thing that I personally like about AoU over Avengers 1 is it didn't feel slow like the first 2/3rds of the first film, now talking about the epic ending battles... I think the final battle of New York was just a tad better, just a tad, because lets face it when Bruce went hulk and put his stop sign of a fist to the giant chitauri carrier, everybody in the world was like...this is a dream come true! And Age of Ultron gives me that feeling, but I don't know thats how hard it is to decide, but mark my words the battle against Ultron is not going to disappoint what so ever!! As for my final point: the acting! Robert Downey Jr. Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Mark Ruffalo, Jeremy Renner, Chris Hemsworth all get their equal share in this movie and all are as great as usual! Aaron Taylor Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen are very good as the siblings of Quicksilver and the Scarlet Witch, and the fans i think will really enjoy Paul Bettany as the Vision...but the stand out of this film is James Spader as Ultron, sinister yet the humor is there for a great combination to an awesome and next to Tom Hiddleston maybe the best Marvel villain on film ever! Overall I give Avengers: Age of Ultron a 9/10 as a spectacular sequel i cannot wait for blu-ray, and cannot wait to see whats in store for the Infinity wars, hope this helps people!",8

Downey Jr., Hemsworth, Ruffalo, Evans, Renner, Johannson are all back for the new installment. It's their great reunited team since 2012's ""The Avengers"". What makes this different from that first ""Avengers"" movie is that when we open up in this one with a bad ass scene is that everyone's strengths and abilities are helpful towards one another. They are an actual team that can work together and fight together. You truly get to see what makes each and every one of them a kick ass superhero! That's right, even Jeremy Renners Hawkeye! Marvel finally gave him some screen time and actual great stuff to do here. As far as other stars we got Aaron Taylor- Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen playing as Maximof twins, trained to be henchmen of Hydra but eventually become under Ultron wing, played by the amazing James Spader. Once James Spader's Ultron starts causing havoc, it's not only The Avengers strongest physical threat, but mentally. Adding the Maximof towns to this story was great because with their powers and wit, they manage to really make The Avengers face and think of their worst fears. Hallucinations and mind control and super speed, that's a hell of a henchmen team. There's a point in the movie when The Avengers have to hideout and not be on Ultrons radar, and for me that scene is when things were kicking off. There's a ton of drama in there and conflicts and still plenty of surprises about The Avengers talk about why they do what they do, and maybe some stuff in there which some of them take a negative feeling to what powers they have or not able to feel completed in life. What I've been hearing a ton lately is that the movie is too jokey in some parts, often too destructive, and just flat out too loud. I'm just gonna say some things to make up for what people have said. Is it jokey? - Why yes of course it is you can have humor so you can balance out the dark stuff that may be in there. Is it too destructive?- The threat is bigger so you'd understand why the spectacle is there, but it never goes the ""Transformers"" route where there is just unnecessary damage and death everywhere. A lot of fans walked into this film with the expectation from its very sad dopey trailer that this was gonna be like ""The Dark Knight"" almost. Is it ""The Dark Knight""? No it shouldn't have to be, it's got everything in place to be where it can be a little dark and fun. It's really not like totally for kids. All the emotional and tense stuff is balanced just right and this what I expected it to be! Also when a scene is tense, it's really tense! You can't always walk into a movie expecting it to be just exactly like the trailer, well on some conditions Maybe you can but overall just go on there with an open mind and enjoy yourself, I don't see how you couldn't, like Ultron says, ""Oh for Gods sake!"" It's ""The Avengers""! It's a punch a minute, a laugh a minute, ugh it's what you want for an ""Avengers"" flick! It's what I mentioned at the beginning, Marvel outdoing their selfs with every film. And yes, Marvel's ""Avengers:Age Of Ultron"" is so far they're best adventure to date, unless July's ""Ant-Man"" can knock it off the top rank. What's funny about that comparison is that I'm serious, it could, Marvel is just THAT good.",10
Avengers: Age of Diminishing Returns,29 April 2015,"This latest telling of the Avengers left me lacking any enthusiasm with the franchise. I didn't find any warmth, chemistry, fun, anticipated dread, fear, drama, comedy in this showing. The robot wasn't menacing and the extraneous B story dragged on too long and wasn't necessary. I really didn't need to know about the wife and kids. And with the hype surrounding the robot, it wasn't menacing in the clashing with the Avengers. The drones proved not as tough as it was lead on to be, they were more of pest in the grand scheme of things. Bigger sometimes, is not always better. After viewing this, there was no lasting memory once the film was over with, you just wanted to forget about what you saw.",3

I apologize if the new Marvel superhero movie wasn't dark enough for you.,30 July 2015,"The main complaint about this film in all of it's negative reviews is that it isn't ""dark enough"". I was actually pleasantly surprised to find out that this movie blended humor and fun with the darker elements because I was turned off by the teaser trailer. I don't want the new Marvel superhero movies to try to be edgier than everyone else. I thought the darker and lighter elements blended well in the movie. With the exclusion of Quicksilver I liked the new additions. I didn't dislike Quicksilver though, but I did prefer the X-Men version over this one. I thought Ultron was a pretty great villain. He was not as good as Loki or the Ultron marketed in the trailers, but he was still a good enough villain. The movie did seem a bit rushed and Thor's side quest was kind of dumb, but over all I was satisfied with this movie.",8

Autistic Reviewers opinion on this movie.,10 November 2015,"When it was confirmed that a sequel to The Avengers was in the pipeline for Marvel Studios, the question that surrounds the film was' Will it overthrow its first film?' and by golly it does with amazing results. Avengers: Age of Ultron is not only one of those anticipated films that have expectations from every Marvel fan but it does tick the boxes for what the general audience wants to see. Just weeks after the release of Fast & Furious 7, AOU will have its chance to become a hit with fans and the box-office.

AOU takes place after the events of the previous films (Iron Man 3, Thor 2, and Captain America: The Winter Soldier) with The Avengers fighting the baddies that plot to dominate the world, but without the assistance of S.H.I.E.L.D with being destroyed (see Winter Solider to further explain this). Wanting to help the battle for peace further, Tony Stark and Bruce Banner develop a program/A.I. tech that will protect and serve the world but a particular source used causes a birth of a villain in the form of a robot and artificial technology named Ultron. This places the heroes not only in a battle to stop him, but they will encounter threats not only from him but from allies and future events.

Firstly, the storyline itself goes into bigger, darker and epic depths than what the previous film had and the location settings make it redeemable that they fight not only for one country but for the world the heroes live in. In terms of 'darkness' we are shown some dark pasts and future events, a villain who is hell-bent on exterminating the human race and perhaps confrontations between the heroes themselves on who is right, true and loyal to the code. Casting here is in top shape with the likes of Downey Jr., Evans, Hemsworth, Johansson, Renner and its supporting cast all providing great back-up to the character development and on-screen chemistry.

The visual effects are much like the amazing quality of not only from the first Avengers film but the previous MCU films that made them so acclaimed. The design of Ultron in particular was great, it made me believe that character was a threat and his personality is both dark and ruthless which makes him a best Marvel villain to appear in the MCU to date. The action set pieces are all choreographed to great detail, ranging from invading a castle of HYDRA operatives, an epic street fight between Hulk and Iron Man in the streets of Johannesburg city and the climatic stand-stand between good and bad make it all entertaining for action fans and comic book enthusiasts.

Avengers: Age of Ultron is indeed bigger, better, darker and more spectacular than its first film but without losing its trademark style of humor, storytelling and characters. It indeed places a spot on my Best Films list for 2015 and even now I wish that the 3rd Phase would kick off as I want to see how further it can go if it sticks to its cinematic formula.

Avengers Evolve,23 August 2015,"From start to finish, this movie ticked all the boxes you would expect from a classic Marvel sequel, but definitely worth watching with friends or with the kids.

In short, the movie was mostly of good quality, with a large scoop of action, effects and mild humour to carry you through the somewhat unexpected but interesting storyline.

The introduction of several new characters in the film was a little bit vague, which I found annoying. Marvel have forgotten that getting to know a characters inner self and abilities in-depth, is the key part of being a Marvel fan!!

Great film, but stop slacking with the detail.!!",8
Avengers Age of Ultron,10 August 2015,"Marvel has made many great movies since 2008, and is continuing to make them for the foreseeable future. Marvel's past movies are The Hulk, Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk, Iron Man 2, Thor, Captain America the First Avenger, The Avengers is the highest grossing comic book adapted movie ever, Iron Man 3, Thor The Dark World, Captain America The Winter Soldier, Guardians of the Galaxy, then the latest Avengers Age of Ultron. Avengers Age of Ultron has an all-star cast, Robert Downey JR. (Sherlock Holmes), Chris Evans, Scarlett Johannsson (Lucy), Mark Ruffalo (Now You See Me), Chris Hemsworth (Rush), Jeremy Renner (Mission Impossible Ghost Protocol, Rouge Nation, Bourne Legacy), Samuel L. Jackson, and James Spader (The Backlist) as the voice of Ultron. James Spader in my opinion has one of the best voices in the world. The length is over 2 hours, and consists of many action scenes. The opening scene is The Avengers taking down the last Hydra base after the events of Captain America the Winter Soldier. The camera angles are used magnificently to show all of the Avengers taking down the Hydra forces, then there is a shot of all the Avengers lined up as they jump across a ditch. Also as usual there is an after credit scene to leave spoilers for the future movies. This scene is of Thanos putting on the Infinity gauntlet with empty Infinity stone spots and he says ""FINE I'LL DO IT MYSELF"". He said that because all of the other people he hired to retrieve the Infinity stones have failed, such as Ronan from Guardians of the Galaxy, The leader of the Tutari Army from the Avengers and Malekieth the dark elf from Thor the Dark World.",8
A worthy sequel to the original Avengers,21 June 2015,"Whedon delivers a stunning sequel to the original Avengers that took the world by storm, with every bit of action, humor, thrill, and overall attractiveness as the original. New characters are introduced at a suitable pace, so they have a suitable amount of on screen time, but not so fast as to feel rushed. The story is excellent, with pieces of unpredictability thrown into the mix. The acting on top of it is superb, as the chemistry within the Avengers really shine through in what I can only assume is an on screen reflection of off screen relationships.

Overall, one of the best movies of 2015.

Looking forward to Civli War and Infinity War Parts I and II.",10
Overdone,27 April 2015,"Whole thing overdone. Pretty bad action sequences,bad acting, plot thinner than a slice of ham. I reckon they're all wallowing in their own self-importance,,let's make a Marvel movie and it will be a hit. The whole premise needs a re-boot. This is turning into an X-Men storyline. Not good directing as there seems to be no start,middle and ending structure. You get the idea from the very start that all is gonna be o.k. Not a BAD movie but definitely only for die-hard fans ages 12 and up.Probably do well but the whole franchise needs to stop taking the audience for granted.All the actors seem to be a bit fed up with the whole thing and if they want more mileage from the franchise they should get a grip.",4

"If you're a real fan, you'll love it...",7 September 2015,"OK, it's not the average superhero movie, specially if you're new into this franchise...like in comics, only reading just one storyline isn't enough to follow the big story behind..and it's big. So watching every movie just for those seconds after the credits is a must...

We all loved every hint to other stories connecting each other and this movie has it's own.

It's IMO a pause in the story...yeah, lots of action, fights and destruction don't seem to be a pause but this movie was an introduction to new characters and relationships...and in between a little, but I think too little reminder of what is coming but that would be my only complaint about it..., entertainment? no doubt about it, you will not want to move from your chair but for some this movie was dull and even boring...well, not my opinion at all.

New and old fans will enjoy watching all those superheroes working together and sometimes against for one reason...blow our minds.

Don't be fooled for some reviews and go watch it...",9
Superhero Depression is Real,27 April 2019,"It's a killer folks. Poor wee superhero's all fall out with each and get all sad about being superhero's It's a wee shame for them. Nobody to talk too, they get awfully upset, then it leads to depression. This film really highlights the tragedy of being a superhero. And we wouldn't wish that pain on anyone who isn't a superhero. For I can only imagine how tough it must be to be able to fly, or lift up a heavy hammer or pretty much be invincible. Oh it's cool actually, they made up with each other, and there all fighting together. Oh that's magic so it is! Good for them. And they've learned something too I'll bet. Something about teamwork and pulling together to defeat the enemy. I hope they remember this learning curve for the other Avengers films. Maybe write it on the noticeboard or send a group WhatsApp. Captain Planet or whatever he's called will be the Admin so he can/remove superhero's. He looks like the kind of jobsworth that will not allow daft Gifs though.",4
Very good sequel of Avengers,1 May 2015,"Great continuation of the original, maybe just a little bit worse than the original. The film does not have any major flaws. The director took care about a good balance of the characters in the film (now there are more), action and humor. Visually the film is spectacular, there are many actions and those scenes are great shot. Some will say that there are too many characters, that there is too much action (seriously?), There's not enough story. Nonsense. The film lasts two and a half hours, which is quite enough. They even had to shorten because the first version was a long three hours and some tidbits. While expecting a darker approach in sequel, it can not happen. Also a weakness that no major unexpected moments. Usually I expect when the denouement, but it has not happened. I think the new characters well represented. There are several fine moments in the film that I will not mention for the sake of spoilers. One can now say that the phase 2 ready and has already started slowly preparing for a new wave of the third phase. Although the next movie Ant-Man, the real spectacle is expected in the new sequel Captain America - Civil War that can be considered a continuation of Avengers with respect to the story. Everything will culminate in Avengers 3 which will be released in two parts. My rating is 8/10. Very funny movie with some minor flaws, but two and a half hours we have passed relatively quickly.",8
"Not as good as the first, but still hugely entertaining.",24 April 2015,"Expectations couldn't have been higher for this mega-sequel. The first Avengers was absolutely amazing and the steady line of Marvel flicks up to this point, culminating in the glorious Guardians of the Galaxy, has been rock-solid. With so little wiggle room in its margin of error, it's not surprising that Age of Ultron doesn't quite reach the popcorn perfection it aims for. Without the near-unachievable comparisons weighing it down, however, this has everything you could ask for in a two-hour plus blockbuster (take note Transformers).

Packed to the rafters with action, director Joss Whedon and his team concoct a wide array of thrilling and inventive set pieces that are the undeniable drawcard for the movie. The enormous budget gives Whedon the licence to go crazy with his imagination and, with flawless CGI and judicious 3D effects, he leaves nothing in the tank. Opening with a Bond-esque, pre-title snowy assault that boasts a long, uncut shot featuring each Avenger getting their kickass on, Whedon rarely lets the pace slip for the remainder of the movie. Wisely though, he changes the focal characters of each skirmish, meaning we get increased Hawkeye and Black Widow action in addition to newbies Scarlett Witch and Quicksilver.

Speaking of fresh faces – because by now you know exactly what you get from the established players – the new kids on the blocks are a mixed bag. As tormented siblings Scarlett Witch and Quicksilver, Elisabeth Olsen and Aaron Taylor-Johnson are excellent, adding a dark and arrogant spark to their havoc reeking. The titular psycho-robot Ultron is conceptually brilliant and voiced with demented glee by James Spader, but is relatively one-note and can't fill the Loki-sized hole in the villainous department. Then there's a character (name withheld to avoid spoiling) introduced in the final act who is so silly and visually ill conceived it is mind-boggling he made the cut at all.

Narratively there are a few stumbling blocks as well, with Whedon's script feeling flimsy and like it's solely in service of propelling the Avengers to their next battle. Although he has absolutely nailed the irreverent humour yet again, sharing the comedy around with all and sundry. Stark is his normal, lovable arsehole (Quicksilver also edging into that domain), and Cap and Thor are the centre of some amusing out-of-time and out-of-place gags, yet the wise-cracking Hawkeye and the ultra-condescending Ultron are unexpected recipients of Whedon's most hilarious dialogue.

It might sit a few places down the Marvel Cinematic Universe totem pole thanks to a subpar plot and a truly awful new character, but Age of Ultron fires on all action and comedy cylinders required to make it a hugely entertaining superhero flick.",8

Disney why don't you better make stand ups?,30 April 2015,,8
Incomprehensible Mess,12 May 2019,The weakest of the Avengers films that I have seen. It is an absolute mess. The plot is all over the place and impossible to follow. Action scenes roll into endless action scenes. Too many characters are thrown in and discarded again almost immediately. Characters change motivations with almost no explanation. All this combined to make the film a boring chore to watch as I struggled through it. The fact that this film made so much money and was universally loved says much about the gullibility of most Marvel fans who will swallow anything as long as all the characters are in it.,4
the ideal combination of the MCU films! and one of the best movies of the year!,24 August 2015,"first of all, I have to admit that even after watching the first avenger movie, I wasn't yet, fully convinced with the incredible talent of joss whedon...which is very unfortunate; considering how surprised I am walking out of the age of ultron experience; he was able to create a wonderful chemistry between this very different characters and give them very efficient arguments and vision about what's the right thing to do , it felt almost like a great drama film with awesome and well executed action sequences, as well as the constantly good performances by everyone, especially RDJ.... it's worth mentioning that the villain -ultron- was kind of likable with his well delivered quotes and his thoughts about the evolution of mankind, even though he hadn't that much stuffs to do especially at the end of the movie. besides,other characters were introduced in this movie, and ""vision' was without a doubt the one who stole it; through his great debut speech and his marvelous appearance. However, I wasn't that much invested in the two others,especially quicksilver who I think was more of weak point in the movie,in addition to some little plot holes like the first appearance of nick fury and the way the avengers have defeated ultron ... overall, I think that this movie is the perfect continuation of the MCU, and an amazing mixture of fun,humour with some solid action and great characters development.

Great Film. Cant wait for the next one!,15 May 2015,"Simply a great film. It has all the elements of a fantastic comic book/ fictional film. It makes me want to tie blanket around my neck and run around with a hammer in my hand pretending to be Thor. Nicely done Joss Whedon! - Good characterisation - Plenty of comedy - A lot of exuberant action - A hint of romance - A Hulk - Comic book references - Cliché/ Cheesy 1 Liners (but they work, Honestly!) - A short post credit Teaser, thats long enough to make you gag with excitement for the next film. If those don't really do it for you, then watch it because everyone else has. And you don't want to be person thats missing out! I enjoyed the film so much so that I went to watch it a second time. I'd probably go again. Its that good.",10
"A must see movie, for anyone!!!",13 June 2015,"I don't see how this movie is getting less than seven stars at least. It is absolutely amazing and I am beginning to consider if it is now one of my favourite Marvel movies. I will need to watch it again, but I could watch this film non stop. I am a massive marvel fan-girl and I just can't believe how overwhelming this film was. I don't want to give any spoilers. However, I am going to say that if you were to watch this film you will laugh, cry, and be really shocked about the stories of the Avengers. In this film you get to see what their lives were like when they were younger. And what they are now and it tells you that they can live a normal life. Avengers: Age of Ultron isn't just action stories. There are so many stories and it makes us feel different about the characters. P.s when you go to see this movie; take tissues. :)",10
"Broken characters. Broken pace. Broken villain. Broken, but big.",12 April 2019,"This one doesn't work. It has a lot of potentially awesome things. Ultron could've been an amazing villain with a philosophy (post-humanism, something that X-Men Apocalypse attempted to do as well), a team broken by their worst nightmares (thanks to Scarlett's powers), and the evolution of the team after their ""first mission"" together. But it just didn't reach the potential.

The (a bit) darker story didn't match the light Joss Whedon tone, where everybody speaks with one-liners and witty dialogue (which also sucks, because it makes all the characters pretty much the same thing and it gets old fast).

The nightmares were great, but instead of sticking with them, they only helped to break the pace with a bunch of boring angsty scenes that amounted nothing, because the consequences from them were non-existing. Nobody grew from them. Tony's fears made him to commit the same mistake than before (not trusting anybody); Bruce Banner was again weak and even if morally against it, he didn't stop Tony; Hawkeye presented his family, and now we know who he cheated with Black Widow?; Black Widow considered herself a monster because she remembered that she couldn't have kids (what? That makes her the Hulk? What?); Captain America disliked Tony's attitude... again. Whatever. Ultron was the worst part. He believed in post-humanism (he was that), and yet, the scenes with him were all used to showcase a ""What if Tony Stark were a villain?"" instead. Funny to some, I guess, but terrible for a villain.

Another thing that changed too fast? Scarlet and Quicksilver going from villains to heroes. Weak.

Having said that, the humor works at times, of course, the action is fun even if the stakes low, and the movie goes fast (other than the halt in the middle).",5

Doesn't rise to the level of a popcorn-movie,13 May 2015,"I've seen all the Marvel movies for the past 10+ years. This one was the worst by far (okay, maybe the 2003 Hulk was equally as bad). There were simply too many characters, no character development, too many random plot-jumps with no explanation. It gets 5 points for the initial concept of Ultron, which seems like a reasonable start for a movie. But it gets no more points for the subsequent mess that ensues. My only guess is that there is a whole mythology contained in the graphic novels, which I haven't read; but you are expected to know it all in order to understand the movie. If you haven't read the Marvel graphic novels, then don't bother with this movie.

I predict AOU will make its expected tons of money, but future Marvel movies will find a more skeptical audience. Fool me once...",5
"Avengers Age Of Ultron, Avengers Return",1 May 2015,"Today I took my niece to see Avengers: Age of Ultron the movie we waited for and had talk about for weeks and weeks and today on opening day we saw and it is one of the best films I have seen ever on the big screen. It was made special because I was with my niece.

And I am going to keep this spoiler free because this is a film where you have to see it twice to take it all in. Avengers Age of Ultron gives you everything you would want in a Marvel movie and then some.

The plot this time centers around the Avengers Iron-Man (Robert Downey Jr), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Bruce Banner AKA Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Captain America (Chris Evans), Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Clint Barton/Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) are now up against a new threat a new villain named Ultron (Played by James Spader) along with having to deal with Scarlet Witch (Played by Elizabeth Olsen) and her twin brother Quicksilver (Played by Aaron Taylor-Johnson).

The film is pack with characters from the Marvel Cinematic Universe as Cobie Smulders, Hayley Atwell, Stellan Skarsgard, Idris Elba, Anthony Mackie, Don Cheadle, Samuel L Jackson and many others reprise their roles for the film and of course cameo with Stan Lee.

Now this film has a lot to live up to considering it's following in the footsteps of the other Marvel Movies that have begin with The Avengers but lucky in my opinion the sequel shows how you can make it a strong champion in the Marvel Universe.

The film balance out as you are getting many characters from Marvel into one. Plus the film brought a lot to the table this time.

And I found the humor in this film to be superb as everyone in the theater laugh that it almost got a round of applause, I mean they really did a good job with making you laugh.

When the action scenes happen you are on the edge of your seat, they brought their A-Game for the film with the wild stunts and superb action scenes.

The cast of the film does a grand job with their performance James' take of Ultron really surprised me as well as Elizabeth who I enjoy as Scarlet Witch, of course the original cast did their part and help tell the story of the film where you can feel their emotions from their characters that we know and love.

The Effects for this movie are really good and will take your breath away. Music, I know I always talk about the music in motion pictures but to me if you have the music you got the film since music is as much apart of the movie as the cast and crew are, lucky the music in the film is top notch as you would expect nothing less from Avengers.

There is just so much going for this film that you would be a fool to miss this one everything about this sequel makes it a strong consider for the box office and to become one of the biggest movies of the year.

With story telling, superb special effects, strong acting, humor and intense action scenes you will not be disappointed. There are no strings on me

I give Avengers: Age Of Ultron an 9 out of 10

And for Gosh's Sake Watch Your Language",9
This is as good as entertainment is going to get!,27 April 2015,"Yeah, that's right, I just came back from this little masterpiece. Whedon is a genius. You don't even have to like superheroes or be in on all the lore and all that. This movie has got the original beat on every front. The writing is superb. The action is excellent and the cinematography is amazing. No shaky cams or anything like that. Plus lots of very clever humor. Forget the haters. It got a standing ovation and cheers. I'm still grinning an hour later. You are going to love it. Good times ahead so check it out! It's also worth mentioning that all the characters get there little moment in the spotlight. An impressive feat with such an assembly cast!",9
Pure Hollywood masala,2 May 2015,"A movie is only as good as its villain, which makes sense because that is what our heroes have to unite against. Loki as the villain in ""The Avengers"" was fantastic, but in this film, Ultron is underdeveloped.

It's a great idea, but more time seemed to be devoted to other things than to really focus on what makes this thing tick. More over, the addition of more characters – specifically Quicksilver and the Scarlet Witch, but also a general slate of thugs who come and go – seems a bit too crowded. There's already so many good guys in this film that the trap of superhero sequels to increase the villain number just sends the story all over the place here.

Then there's the action. These sequences are, as expected, top notch. You have fantastic special effects and some really innovative stuff happening from the visual side of things. However, there's a generic feel to these moments. Where the action set-pieces of the first film seem distinct and different from one another, you could practically edit together these moments throughout ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" even when they happen on entirely different continents, and nothing would look any different.

Add the fact the movie has a washed-out palate, which I suppose does distinguish it from the first film's bright and colorful look. Unfortunately, this contributes to the heroes getting lost in a cloud of punching and falling rubble that could be from any point in the film.

Of course, all of these complaints does not mean ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" is a dud of a film. It's still a really fun Marvel superhero movie. It's good, but it's just not crap-your-pants awesome like the first film was. And that's a shame because the string of films between these ""Avengers"" installment have been significantly better than Phase 1 in my eyes.

But yeah, you get to see all your favorite heroes again. You get to see the Avengers try to pick up Thor's hammer. You get to see one of the best Stan Lee cameos out there. You get to see the ""Infinity War"" teased throughout the film. You get to see Hulk smash.

I can't say that I didn't like ""Avengers: Age of Ultron."" I'm sure I will see it again, and watching it in IMAX 3D is still an experience (though I'll reiterate that I wish the color had popped more, but maybe we'll just have to wait until VideoLab gives it the color- correcting treatment they recently gave ""Man of Steel"").

I'm just a bit disappointed in what I got from ""Avengers: Age of Ultron,"" similar how ""Godzilla"" was a come-down from ""Pacific Rim"" or ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" didn't quite have the punch that ""Star Trek"" did. I'm sure when I see ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" again, whether it be during its theatrical release or on Blu-ray, I'll feel better about the whole experience. However, until then, I'll have to cross my fingers for when ""Ant Man"" comes out in a couple months for my Marvel fix.",9
The most spectacular movie I've ever seen!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1 May 2015,"I was a little worried when I saw that this movie only got 75% on Rotten Tomatoes.com. So I paid $11.25 today at 1:00 for 3D with guarded expectations. I was literally on the edge of my seat for 80% of the movie. It was everything I wanted it to be and exceeded my expectations by far. I simply don't understand how a fan of Marvin movies could walk away disappointed with this film. I'm going back to see it again to get clear of some things that I didn't quite get the first time, especially the mind blowing technology in the infinity stones.Sometimes when a movie like this adds so many characters, things get very confusing and jumbled.But this director made it all come together perfectly and every character makes sense and has purpose. INFINITY WARS WILL BE EPIC!",9
Failed attempt at character development,13 June 2015,,5
"It's not only perfection, is resurrection",4 August 2015,"Since Superman Returns(which is a pretty bad movie), is a good example for being an specific superheroes movie, like it's the Avengers Age of Ultron. Marvel has been giving us great movies since Iron Man in 2008, but they have been movies not specific superheroes subjects, like Captain América The Winter Soldier(which is a superheroes/spy movies) or Guardians of the Galaxy(superheroes/space opera movie), and now, Avengers Age of Ultron is a magnificent movie with great special effects, a charismatic villain, a perfect adapted screenplay and one of the best directed superheroes movies ever. Of course there are some disappointments like the over jokes, the pretty bad accent and the cheesy Ultron body, but the perfection and smart script make the mistakes invisibles. That why Avengers Age of Ultron is great not only for the force of the characters and the excellent soundtrack, It's great for being what we need, a perfect superheroes movie.",10

I have an explicit love for comic book movies and Marvel has been on a golden track for almost the last decade. I am proud of what Kevin Fiege and team have done over there with the franchise and for growing the overall geek world into a love fest for all to enjoy. No matter your skin color, creed, gender or sexuality, everyone who goes into a Marvel movie comes out smiling and discussing what they just experienced. And for than I say bravo.

As great as a job that Joss Wheadon did here, it can only tread water for so long before the effects wear off. And I'm not talking about the Computer Graphic Effects",9
10 Out Of 10 (VFX),29 April 2015,"This movie has a real potential to get the award, because the FX was 10 out of 10, Superb effects and Visual Graphic motions, good job Marvel, So that Robert Downey Became the iron man, i think i never seen him so uncomfortable in this film ! And hulk / banner just gonna fly out of being flirt by Romanoff maybe? Maybe the VFS is too much but it is a sci Fri and action so they need a lot of, you know, VFX, maybe thats gonna be 8/10 stars, and not a good story line thanks for reading ;) Hehe i think thor always awkward there, but the accent for quicksilver is abit out of rage And maybe its gonna be the end of the world Thanks marvel for the film, i really enjoy it, i gonna review for the 3D as soon it release",8
AMAZING Action Packed Movie... why so many haters?,27 August 2015,"Firstly I will not go over the movie summary, plenty of reviews have done that, I will simply try and cover some of the questions, some of the negative aspects on which other reviews have focused so that other people may understand that none of those negative reviews actually apply. I won't give away specific spoilers and name certain actions/fates/characters however I will try and help fill any holes which some may have.

I honestly do not understand why this movie have so many bad reviews? It has the same rating as Iron Man 3... almost, a movie which I decided to ignore from the Marvel Series and call it ""Alternate Universe"" story since it made no sense... is it supposed to link with Avengers 2? I didn't think it did, I didn't really see any references so I will go with that:) and I urge the rest to do so too, since Tony Stark is Iron Man, period!!

Now about the movie, I want my brain to have fun, relax and switch off... well not quite off, I want to gasp in awesomeness, laugh and get an eye orgasm (which for the clever people is still controlled by the brain) and this movie delivers on all of those. So yeah I loved it, can't wait for the BD version so I can watch it AGAIN!!!!

Contrary to IM3 at least Avengers 2 tries to stick to the story somewhat. Just a fun fact, the guy that creates and is Ant-Man is the daddy for Ultron:) however let's go with the facts and compare: (1) He (Ultron) hates his creator - In this case Tony. CHECK. (2) He hates all human life and he believes that he is there to replace all humans - in this case it is true he wants to eradicate all human life. CHECK. (3) He took the personality of his creator - in this case we can go with Tony's jokes. CHECK. (4) Ultron has multiple personalities because he was reborn multiple times, he can never truly die - not really related to the movie but FYI. (5) Ultron's main body was made out of adamantium - related to movie. CHECK. (6) Ultron created Vision - pretty accurate 90% so let's go with this too. CHECK.

Oh and for whoever is commenting on the Hulkbuster Iron Man Armour: As the name suggests, it was specifically designed for hand-to-hand combat with the rampaging Hulk. The armor was built as a large exoskeletal shell which fits around Iron Man's normal armor and is equipped with rocket-boosted gauntlets, capable of punching the Hulk back several miles. CHECK CHECK CHECK!!!!!

Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch twins (Magneto is the father), CHECK, not sure what the Hydra connection was but let's go with it, bear in mind X-Men universe doesn't seem to be connected with Avengers in the movies. Quicksilver does have a similar fate in the comics... FYI!

I won't comment on the love interest in the movie since it doesn't kill the story or makes any huge changes, besides if we really want to analyse this, it does make sense how they went with it as they both have dark pasts and are misunderstood. Enough said.

Character clashes... sorry but did people see what happens in X-Men, JLA, Fantastic 4 and so on? Of course there are clashes because they are humans and humans sadly don't always play nice. Every team out there has these conflicts and they are well ""documented"" in the comics and cartoons. Character development missing? Seriously... these are the Heroes of decades of history, if you want that go read their back story or watch the dedicated movies or watch the cartoons.

Too many jokes? You need to realise that this is NOT X-Men, Batman, Superman or other serious super hero movies. Avengers are more on the Fantastic 4 and Spider-Man side with jokes and not taking things too seriously, if you are going to die saving the world you might as well have fun. You don't have the same dread that you do in the other movies because you damn well know... The Avengers are so mighty that nothing can really hurt them. Hulk or Thor on its own could take down... well the Batman, X-Men and even Superman:) For anyone that understand game references (touching on the nerdy side here) Avengers is more the Diablo of games, you get 1000's of monsters yet you know your Character can take them on and it's just pure fun where if you play something like Dark Souls you have that dread. I also love the ""FUSION"" powers, if anyone did play the Marvel Ultimate Alliance is when 2+ heroes combine powers, you saw that in Avengers 1 once I believe but is often used in 2 which is great.

After all that my question is how are people not liking it? I leave you to be the judge as on all aspects the movie does not falls short, and sure as hell doesn't deserve anything lower than an 8.5. It does a great job sticking to the story-line. Only negative is that they did try to fit too much into the 2 hours, they should have made it 3h and give the whiners that extra development and story, build up Ultron, then again some people complained that they fell asleep during the first hour, there is no pleasing a hater.",10
not good enough,10 August 2015,"The avengers, now running on their own, have to face yet another threat, Ulton, who wants to wipe out the man kind. There is something about the avenger films that makes them boring. There are enough action scenes, and some nice and funny dialogs, but the whole thing is tiring. The individual movies of each character are good enough, but the heroes working together comes through quite ugly. I did like that they present us with some of the past lives of some of the characters, but in the end, I found it a little too complicates, with long monologues, little humour, not to mention the twins, an entirely different story from the ones in x men. Maybe the second part was better than the first part, that was a huge disappointment, but all in all, avenger number two failed in every way. Better have them as individuals.",3
Awesome ! must watch.,26 April 2015,"I was waiting from so long time. I had lot of expectations for this movie. Avengers first movie was superb and was huge success. but this is far better and awesome than first movie. I watched this with my friends. and everyone in the theater was happy when movie ends. action are unbeatable. Only disspointing thing is tat Loki is not shown in movie. but things storyline, action, cinematography are amazing. and it made me speechless. starting scene with slow motion was superb.. i sat there with jaw open. completely entertaining and mind blowing . please do watch this movie.. watch with ur family and friends and have fun. it is suitable for witing top 30 of IMDb.",10
It Is The Age of Ultron,24 August 2015,"As Avengers: Age of Ultron has just crossed the billion dollar mark in worldwide box office, I thought that it would be appropriate for me to finally put a few thoughts into the value of this movie. I have viewed the movie twice and have read numerous reviews and visited comment boards trying to get a rounded perspective before I began this review.

For me, reviewing a movie that is part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe is a challenging task. Professional reviewers tend to look at movies as singular pieces of work and seem to be stymied by the concept of an organic storytelling method. This film has seen negative reviews as it spends a portion of itself moving pieces and characters to a ""place"" where the next film will pick up. As such, the film includes a small number of scenes that have little to do with the characters' journey and struggle against the antagonist which is present in traditional storytelling.

Kevin Feige from Marvel Studios has discussed how the villain Ultron is relevant to our society currently. That we rely on technology as much as we do is a common theme in current fears and how much of our humanity is lost through our everyday practices. The idea behind concepts like Ultron is that through our actions with little regard for consequences we may bring about technology that will affect our lives so dramatically that there is no going back.

Age of Ultron is the culmination and crescendo of the second phase of the Marvel Cinematic Universe so far as Ant-Man will not be released until July. Most of the events of Iron Man 3, Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Thor: The Dark World and Guardians of the Galaxy have led to this film. As such while Age of Ultron may not be able to exist without these films; what is coming after this film will rely on Age of Ultron for it's exposition. While this is a storytelling method that is revolutionized by Marvel Studios it is not without it's pitfalls. There are moments where the pace of the story is slowed down in order to accommodate this ""always looking ahead"" philosophy.

There are a lot of moving parts to Age of Ultron. Four main characters are introduced: Ultron, Wanda Maximoff, Pietro Maximoff and The Vision. In addition to having nine other major characters their screen time isn't as much as it could be though for their roles it is appropriate. In fact the film does a better than average job at balancing all of the characters and keeping the pace up and exciting. While in the first Avengers film, Robert Downey Jr had most of the attention on him; in this film while he is present through the film it is Chris Evans' Captain America who begins the movie with a moral dilemma and is the character who changes the most on his journey through story.

When Director Joss Whedon began his tour of duty on The Avengers he wanted a story to where just because someone is a hero it doesn't mean that they get a free pass. This is very prominent in Age of Ultron. Due to the events of Avengers and Iron Man 3, Tony Stark reacts by creating a source of technology that brings even greater destruction to his world. It is because of this kind of reaction that The Avengers must fight their own fears made real and their own dark sides. The world in which they inhabit is not one of good versus evil. It is one steeped in realism in which ""one creates that which they fear the most"". The protagonists have to struggle against a threat brought upon simply by their own presence.

The film is just as beautiful as the first one. Circular camera movement features heavily into the expanded action scenes. It is used to great effect to enhance the team atmosphere. We are also exposed to long takes that show all The Avengers in action at the same time. These are methods that we have seen before but Mr. Whedon expands upon them to use them to better effect.

The actors who are reprising their roles are spot on as has been the case throughout the Marvel movies. In fact as time goes on some of these characters keep getting better and better. The new actors were expertly picked as well. Aaron Taylor Johnson displays Pietro's arrogance perfectly as well as concern for his sister, Elizabeth Olsen brings the insecurity of Wanda, James Spader brings an eloquence and through voice work a sense of menace to Ultron and Paul Bettany who had previously voiced Tony Stark's A.I. Jarvis debuts as The Vision. Through Mr. Bettany's career he has played roles which have required a logical viewpoint mixed with genuine compassion. The Vision is portrayed expertly through this viewpoint.

In the end this film is about family. Not family in the traditional sense but the kind of a world we create and how we expect the next generation to cope with it. This is seen primarily through Ultron, The Vision, Wanda and Pietro. It is also about finding our place in the world that we inherit and help to create organically.",9
Avengers Age of Ultron,29 August 2015,"I don't know which words to use to describe the beauty and greatness of this movie so i am gonna use all of them , I waited long time since the release of this movie because it reach our country very late so before i saw it i heard and read lots of bad comments and reviews for example that this movie is a disappointment or that the Villain is not good and ETC but in my heart i was 1000% sure that they are wrong so when i saw this super great , Awesome , amazing , marvelous , beautiful , superb one of the greatest movie of the history it was proved that they were wrong i mean the action is extraordinary super great visual effects the acting is perfect all of the actors did a fantastic job especially Iron man , Captain , Thor and Hawk are perfect and the Villain couldn't be more better he is perfect so overall i super love this movie one of the greatest movie of MCU i gave this movie 10 stars and plus this movie is equal to the Avengers and Captain America winter soldier or a little above them . thank you Marvel.",10
Age of awesomeness!,1 May 2015,"Lives up to the excitement I pent up for it.

I got to give Joss Whedon cred as a filmmaker. Age of Ultron is a very different movie than the Avengers, and I was expecting the Avengers, which hit me with a curve ball and made the movie something that I had to seep in.

It helps that the movie began with a cool action sequence that introduces all the players (old and new).

James Spader as Ultron was perfect. Dark, Inhumane, and the best part was that he does not even realize it. It's was the type of performance that can put the comic book villain up there with movie villains like Darth Vader.

Hawkeye gets to shine a little more for those who are huge fans of the Avenger, and Sam Jackson looks like he got into shape to play Fury again, not bad!

And Lots more Avengers to choose from. Reminds me of X-Men 2, you would think too many heroes would clutter up the movie, but in the end it worked. (Or maybe as a comic book fan I got Goosebumps seining so many heroes on the same screen). Lots of cameos and trivial points for geeks as well.

I also loved how worldwide the movie is. I've seen New York being destroyed so many times on the Big screen it becomes unreal, so it was fun watching other cities from around the world get destroyed. Keeps it down to Earth. Some of the best fight scenes are front in center in more realistic places which heightens the excitement.

I have to say, I liked the original better than the sequel (also like Captain America: the Winter Solder better). In this sequel, we got to know the Avengers a lot better with a lot of emotional talk, which made the movie iffy for me, but like I said the movie has to seep in on you. It did have the advantage of being the more heroic movie with the Avengers sometimes feeling like fire fighters while saving the world, at the same time being darker with a lot of geeky scenes about the definition of a hero.

New Avengers, Darker Villain, and more scenes with the team fighting together as one. Definitely worth the IMAX dollars",9
Too Cheesy,11 June 2015,"When I was 12 I watched the first avengers movie and loved it. Now watching the 2nd at 15 it seemed to me like the exact same thing, and the cheesy jokes every few minutes frustrated me. Other than that, great CGI just a dodgy storyline.

I think when making a movie you can get away with a mix of Action and Comedy, but the avengers crosses that line with countless bad jokes. Personally I am a DC Comics fan over marvel. Marvel went too far by putting there main superheroes into a team. Made a lot of money but for me it didn't really work.

The effects were advanced, and seeing this on big screen was a privilege. Good fighting scenes, and some fairly amusing moments. The villain was also too cheesy, taking the dark knight series for example: The Joker and Bane were awesome. We need some crazy villains like them in the avengers, not Loki or some computer (Ultron).",5
Another Splendid Score by Whedon,27 April 2015,,8
Brilliant.,2 May 2015,"I honestly find it hard to believe that so many reviews on here claim the first movie to be better... it isn't.

For starters there is story and content all the way through, the acting continues to be top notch and the action... well its brilliant. It's honestly hard to review this because I don't want to spoil anything for you at all.

Finally this movie feels important unlike the first and if anything it brings a sort of importance to the first movie.

After guardians this is probably my #2/3 marvel movie and I imagine that will fall once civil war and Ragnarök arrive.",8
"Avengers Age of Ultron packs a hefty punch with spectacular action sequences, great storytelling, and that classic Joss Whedon charm.",25 August 2015,"Above all, Avengers Age of Ultron is entertaining. The addition of more action was a great choice as it helps maintain the fast pace of the movie. Despite the number of movies that are now cluttered with CGI, Age of Ultron still does contain a couple of visually stunning, jaw-dropping scenes. The new characters in the movie are probably the greatest addition, as Quicksilver, Scarlet Witch, Vision, and Ultron all have their moments. Above all, the movie just felt like a big homecoming that just so happens to feature freaking awesome superheroes.

The main problem with Age of Ultron was that it just tired to fit too much into a 2 hr 21 min time frame. Everything from the development of Ultron to the build up felt a little rushed. This could have easily been avoided if Marvel would have stuck with Whedon's original 3 hr cut. Age of Ultron also suffers from a villain who simply didn't manage to live up to Loki. Now I do think that Ultron is still one of Marvel's best villains, but he still manages to fall short of his predecessor due to a cliché ""take over the world"" plan. The film also fails to recreate some of those classic lines that were featured in the original, as those lines tend to fall flat.

All in all, Avengers Age of Ultron still serves its main purpose as another great addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe!!",8
"Great, but a bit chaotic at times",1 May 2015,"First off, I'll get this out of the way. Is it better than the first Avengers movie? Not quite, but it's almost as good. In my opinion, of course.

One issue--too many characters for the time they had! They bring in new heroes and you barely have time to remember the name before we've moved on. They bring back minor heroes from past movies, but don't have the time to actually use those characters much during battles. Honestly, if it had been a bit longer, it might have felt less chaotic. I understand that this is just a fact of the comic world, there simply ARE that many heroes involved. But it's hard to keep them straight on a movie screen.

The comedy was decent. Better than in past Marvel movies, where during a climactic battle everyone pauses for some wisecracks. That didn't happen this time, but of course there were still plenty of jokes. I like that, it just needs to be the right time.

It was confusing, I'll be honest. I want to watch it a couple more times. Certain parts were never explained, but again that's comics. So I need to watch it over again to really ""get it"".

That all being said, I did love it. Each main Avenger got their screen time. Of course it's RDJ-heavy, because this is a storyline based around Iron Man. But no one is really neglected. There was plenty of action, lots of joking, some drama and fun...to me, it's very close to the level of the first Avengers movie. Not quite there, but almost. And that's about what I expected, so I was satisfied.",8
Perfect way to start the summer of blockbusters...,23 April 2015,"The good: The second installment of the Marvel franchise the Avengers starts off with a well choreographed action sequence. Lots of brilliant tracking shots that follow all the Avengers will setup to an action-packed film. Of course there's the great bits of comedy and one-liners that we have all grown to expect, and the cast is really showing how well they gel together. James Spader is absolutely brilliant as the voice of Ultron with his smooth delivery of lines, but more surprising how Joss Whedon let him have a bit of humanistic personality. Without giving anything away, the film filled my expectations thoroughly.

The bad: Completely disregarding the fact that I read the comics, the film was quite predictable, even for those who know nothing about Ultron. The pacing of the film kind of leads to a foreseeable narrative. I really enjoyed the casting choice for the twins, but I'll be completely honest, Evan Peter's portrayal of Quicksilver in Bryan Singer's X-Men was superior. Even at 141 minutes, I feel at times the story was rushed, and at times dragged on, but that's just being overly critical.

Overall, the film was a blast and met my every expectations. I can't imagine anybody feeling disappointed walking away from this one. Have your popcorn and beverage ready and get ready for the start of a promising summer at the cinema!",5
Marvel Keeps Getting Better,6 June 2015,"Avengers: Age of Ultron was an excellent movie. I would absolutely recommend taking the time to see it, especially if you happen to be a fan of the Marvel movies that have been released to date.

I've seen a lot of mixed reviews, the complaints mostly focusing on the fact that there was a lot of story and a great deal of activity shoved into a package that was just shy of two and a half hours. Maybe it's because I spent a lot of my life reading comic books, but I didn't feel at all like the narrative was rushed or unevenly paced at all. Personally I felt that there was a terrific balance between well choreographed action and well-written character development...though I might have liked to see a little bit more of the story dedicated to The Vision, Scarlet Witch, and Quicksilver depending on how it was managed. The introduction of those three characters was fantastic though, and I thoroughly loved the change in dynamics that they forced upon the existing Avengers.

One of the other negative things that I saw frequently expressed was disdain for the segment of the movie that took place on Hawkeye's farm, with the introduction of a secret life that only he, Black Widow, and Fury were previously aware of. I couldn't disagree more with those who complained about that bit of story arc, or any of the other sections of the movie that focused on fleshing out the characters who haven't had the benefit of multiple movies establishing the more human, non-hero sides to them.

Ultron was handled better than I went into the movie expecting, AI is always a bit touchy for me because it is handled so poorly in almost all cases. Ultron, however wasn't necessarily an AI, not in the sense that The Vision was at least, basically amounting to little more than a trap waiting for an individual or society technologically advanced enough to assemble it. The results would likely have been the same or at least similar if Hydra had completed the project instead of Banner and Stark doing so, the only real aspect of Ultron that was provided by Stark was the name and a sort of substrate into which the AI was dumped. I get the feeling that people who claimed that the character arc was basically little more than an AI being created, accessing the internet, and deciding that humanity was something that needed to be eradicated weren't paying altogether too much attention to the fact that the AI template for Ultron was already present, within the Mind Gem, and Tony was essentially stealing that blueprint and hoping to embed it into his Ultron project...at least that was what I gathered from the dialogue between he and Banner.

I honestly didn't see any of the flaws that I heard people complaining about at all, and I loved the movie. I don't know that I would trust anyone claiming to have liked it more than Guardians of the Galaxy, but it comes a close second to that as far as the Marvel cinematic universe is concerned, edging just ahead of Captain America: The Winter Soldier as my second favorite of these movies.

I tried to avoid any spoilers, but some tiny ones were necessary in order to counter the criticisms I've been reading from those who disliked the movie or at least aspects of it. Ultimately you're going to have to make up your own mind though, see the movie (if you haven't already), and decide for yourself whether it was great or just good...I am leaning towards great.",9
A Must Watch for Movie Fans.,1 May 2015,,9
"Ignore the buzz kill, snob critics who live with their moms",1 May 2015,"Seems like as soon as this movie came out all the arm chair critic wanna-be's get on here and start giving it 1 star. Have people forgot how to have fun, it's a superhero movie not Shakespeare in the park. I've read comics my whole life, I know the comic version of this story very well, but I didn't care they made changes. Comics can tell a much broader story than a movie can. This movie packs a punch. It's funny, tons of action, the fights were amazing, and I had goose bumps several times.

I won't give any spoilers but Vision is the bomb. Loved his character. Sit back, enjoy the movie, and take in all the visuals and story telling. We know the characters pretty well by now so it won't be as deep in character development as some were wanting, and they have to introduce Ultron fairly quickly, but it still works and punches you right in the fun button.",9

Bigger means better for Age of Ultron,2 May 2015,"While certain plot elements are rushed, Age of Ultron is an incredible theater experience and delivers some jaw dropping action scenes. The performances are all great, and James Spader gives us the best villain the MCU has had to date. The newcomers, Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver, are surprisingly fun and add a new layer to the film If your looking for a fun time and some insane fight scenes filled with the wit and charm you know from previous Marvel films, Age of Ultron is for you. It is the best MCU film we have gotten since Iron Man. Age of Ultron will not disappoint, especially for fans of the comics. If not, you at least get some sweet fight scenes.",8

"If you rated it less than a 9, blame the hype",25 May 2015,"I'm a big MCU fan, and was very excited for this movie. I watched the trailers more than a few times, and I'm a big Whedon fan. I went into the theater knowing I'd love the movie.

I loved the movie.

My excitement for it was so peaked from the expectations, hype, and the trailers that my love of it was tempered a bit initially. It was all that I'd hoped for, but not more than that. How could it be? You can't rate it 11 out of 10.

A little too many cherries in the trailers, and unneeded hype, can spoil the actual movie excitement a little.

Cool your jets a bit before watching, or calm down and watch it again, before you rate it.",10
"Marvel fans, you will not be disappointed",1 May 2015,I saw the Imax 3D midnight showing as I always do for Marvel. I hate paying $17 for a movie ticket but i did not leave disappointed. This movie is worth the extra few bucks. Lots of action and introduction to a lot of new characters which is exciting. As a fan of the comics I was happy that they chose to stick close to the comic book storyline. Obviously contains its usual Marvel humor. Im going to see this a couple more times while in theater. I hate to admit it but I liked it more than the first Avengers. Its hard to compare though since it has a different tone. Family friendly and just a good time all around. This movie was a perfect wrap up of Phase 2,10
Everything I needed to see and more.,1 May 2015,"This movie is so beautifully crafted, organic. It leaves you wanting more and in pain that something you waited for so badly has ended. This one seems darker than the first one, it still includes that light humor that we loved so much in the first one, it's action packed, sometimes it's even hard to digest all the action happening. After seeing Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. episode connected to the movie I really pieced it all together and I'm proud that I totally guessed how the movie is going to start and I was not disappointed in any way. The most beautiful thing was Vision, the way he looked and acted, I was really enjoying it. Marvel movies always have this surprise moment in them and in Age Of Ultron something so usual for normal people and totally unexpected for a superhero grabbed me by shock, who am I kidding, it was full of surprises and I had my mouth open most of the time. You totally need to watch this. And you need to remember that nothing is perfect, but this in my opinion is the closest you can get.",10
Disappointing,11 July 2015,"Curiously enough, Captain Beefcake makes an oblique reference to the 1927 Yankees in the final scene of the movie (I will not call it a ""film""), exactly when I was thinking of the great 1990s Yankees teams that won four World Series titles from 1996 to 2000. And if you even dare try to tell me that the year 2000 was not part of the 1990s, I will Ultron your ass so hard you will wish you were a transplant patient waiting in line for Mickey Mantle's liver. (See what I did there?)

The reason I conjured up those latter damn Yankees is because they didn't really need Joe Torre to manage them, no more than the Avengers needed Joss Whedon to direct them. In fact, I bet Avengers: Age of Ultron would have turned out pretty much the same with absolutely no director at the helm. Consider the great managing decisions Joe Torre made in those late 1990s games, like ""Start Jeter,"" or ""Bring in Mariano Rivera for the 9th."" Pure genius.

Consider the great directorial decisions Joss Whedon made such as: ""Make a couple of homophobic jokes,"" and ""Have Thor do something with the hammer thingy."" Or ""Drag out everything until everyone in their seats has their sciatica act up again.""

I'm upset because I kind of liked the earlier Avengers movies, and I thought Joss Whedon was a marvelous writer of punchy, clever dialogue. No more. He's a hack and he's cashed a nice check. It's fine. Must be nice.

Is it ironic that the movie is about an artificial intelligence gone awry, when the entire global blockbuster industry of movies is run by algorithms designed to commodify the human spirit?

The subtitle ""Age of Ultron"" is certainly misleading. It should be ""An Hour with Ultron."" Actually, that might be a good time. You see, Ultron is funny. He makes dry jokes. He has Tony Stark's personality, which is why he is trying to destroy the world, because, you know, Tony Stark can't tell the difference between destroying or saving the world, either, which is why there have been so many Iron Man movies where Tony Stark is the villain trying to destroy the world.

Stuff blows up real good for about 150 minutes. Stuff blows up, real good. We have a laughable ""romance"" develop between the Hulk and ScarJo, where we so thankfully learn that neither of them can bear fruit in their barren reproductive holes. Captain Beefcake's goody- two-shoedness is played to the hilt. We get the maudlin Hawkeye family scenario. We get two new Avengers (until one of them dies after inexplicably saving a child while the entire planet hangs in the balance). We get a villain in Ultron who is a renaissance Lawnmower Man on K2, but is too stupid to actually do anything realistic with the power of controlling the Internet, and instead keeps trying to discover nuclear launch codes.

But more importantly, we get the cogs to churn forth near the end as we find Vision and the exposition for the next movies about the Infinity Gauntlet and the Infinity Gems. It seems strange that movies like Ant-Man are forthcoming when THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE IS AT STAKE because the Infinity Gauntlet is, well, just click this link because I don't have the energy to explain any of it. And isn't it colossally unfair that it's a gauntlet? What if someone without hands wants to wield its power? Maybe it should be an Infinity Sock. Nah, that's unfair to people without feet. How about an Infinity Tam? Everyone has a head, right? Now we're going to upset the Headless Horseman.

The movie isn't all bad. It gets a +1 for Stan Lee still being alive and making stupid cameos. Another +1 for destroying some lame-ass foreign place instead of New York again. Scratch that. They destroy both New York and some lame-ass foreign place, so -1, and now we're back to zero.

If we must have an Infinity War, just remember: everything is everything and nothing is nothing.",5
Enough flies to make it worthwhile,2 May 2015,"Let me start off about Ultron. Voiced (and performed, perhaps in mo-cap) by James Spader, he is a weird, robotic creation meant for peace and, instead, reverts to the ways of violence. Actually, that's not entirely true: Ultron gets all the information on what is up with his sorta-creator Tony Stark, and the world, and realizes there is a way to make peace: by getting rid of all the people on it. He may need some things for it, like the stone inside of Loki's scepter, and then he'll be ready to go.

What's so refreshing with Ultron is that he/it's a villain who probably, no, for sure knows how twisted this is, and yet sees with such contempt what the Avengers are and stand for. That and being a sarcastic son of a b****. He's the sort of curse words that the heroes, in mock jest, tell each other not to say. You know, kids are watching! Age of Ultron is as BIG a spectacle as they come, with the action you come to expect from Marvel movies. The highlight for me is when the Hulk, influenced by the powers of the Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen, among many top shelf actors here), goes on a rampage in an African city, and the only one who can stop him is Tony Stark - as the HULKBUSTER. And yet for how ridiculous this sort of fight can get, as others in the film like when A.I.'s Ultron and the Vision (the later-model sort of hybrid of other alien stuffs whatever of Jarvis) go at it, Whedon makes the battles creative and refreshing.

And there's even time out to, you ready for this, showing the superheroes going out of their way not only to make sure people are out of harm's way (much as they can, sometimes it can't be helped, though there's no R-rated stuff for here), they save people sometimes one by one. Though things certainly get melodramatic near the end - there may be death, there may be rather abrupt departures for characters for, you know, 'reasons' of the plot that aren't convincing - the writing is consistently clever and funny throughout. Genuinely funny I should say; you don't expect to get things like a Eugene O'Neil reference, but it does come at one point (whoops, does that count as a spoiler)?

There can be gripes with certain decisions characters make, or that the film has both too much in it and not enough time to go even further with things - allegedly a director's cut is waiting for DVD. But this is the sort of case where I'm happier to get more rather than less, and there's a balance of strong character interactions and great dialog carrying things along. A relationship like the one that Banner and Natasha have shouldn't work - for some it might ring as false or rushed, like where was this in the first film(?) Whedon ultimately knows two things: we're invested already with these characters (and he's done his share in the first Avengers), and there's real pain and tragedy to how they connect. Could things be different if they weren't broken people, or thought they were, amid the heroic acts? Who knows? But the filmmakers put that in there just as we think it's ALL about the jokes and mayhem.

Added to this are some wonderful new characters like Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch - people who you don't know for sure will or won't be the villains, the 'puppets' for Ultron ironically enough - and reappearances by others in the gallery of characters from the past Iron Man and Captain America and Thor movies (Incredible Hulk... well, who knows). It's all so much you may take for granted that Downey is still a blast to watch as Stark, a man who is his own worst enemy and keeps screwing things up for his team. He's self-aware, terrible and wonderful, a jerk and a realist, and drives the story forward.

So... yeah, good times all around, if less than great for reasons of certain plot issues, things that seem to go by so quickly you may need to watch it a second time, and characters that only get a sliver of screen time (i.e. Andy Serkis, and... Julie Delpy?!)",8
"""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" is even better than 2012's ""Avengers""",1 May 2015,"Marvel has pulled off something INCREDIBLE – something unprecedented in the annals of American cinema! They have assembled the parts of four different movie franchises into a combination franchise – and it's a huge, HULKing success! Almost a decade ago, when I first heard of Marvel's plans to make separate movies about the Incredible Hulk, Iron Man, Captain America and Thor, and then bring them all together in an ""Avengers"" movie, I admit that I was a bit skeptical. I said to myself, ""Self, that's a lot of time, effort and money towards a single goal. I hope, for their sake, these movies don't suck."" I watched and waited to see if they could IRON out the details, and MAN, did they! The 2008 Hulk movie (2003's ""Hulk"" wasn't part of this grand plan), the three Iron Man movies and the Captain America and Thor films (two each) and 2012's ""Avengers"" have made a combined total of over $2.6 billion – in the U.S. alone! By the hammer of THOR, that's a lot of money! More importantly, these nine films (ten, if you count Marvel's ""Guardians of the Galaxy"") have averaged 7.4 stars on IMDb.com and an 82% audience rating on rottentomatoes.com! And now, writer/director Joss Whedon, the CAPTAIN of this culminating franchise, has given us a blockbuster that may break box office records in America and all over the world! Is Whedon's ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" (PG-13, 2:21) worth all that? For the details (but no spoilers), and our official Movie Fan judgment, read on. The AVENGERS have ASSEMBLED! ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" (as part of this grand plan for the Marvel Cinematic Universe) picks up on the cues and clues left us in ""The Avengers"". As the 2015 episode opens, Iron Man / Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.), The Hulk / Dr. David Banner (Mark Ruffalo), Captain America / Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Black Widow / Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson) and Hawkeye / Clint Barton (Jeremy Renner) are racing through the woods in the fictional Eastern European country of Sokovia, to a secret research laboratory where they hope to reacquire Loki's scepter. As we learned from the previous film, that staff has tremendous power and can't fall into the wrong hands. And in the right hands, it could be very beneficial. There's a rare stone within the scepter and that Stark realizes he can use to power Ultron, the artificial intelligence project that he's been working on. The idea is that Ultron would function as a global defense system to keep the world safe from aliens with bad intentions. ""Peace in our time,"" Stark calls it. The problem is two-fold. ""Peace in our time"" was the phrase used by British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain after he got Adolf Hitler to sign an agreement not to attack England and we all know how that turned out. Secondly, these guys have apparently never seen any of the ""Terminator"" movies, in which a defense technology called ""Skynet"" was supposed to keep earth's inhabitants safe and we all know how THAT turned out.

When Ultron becomes self-aware (much more quickly than Skynet did), he makes himself a body out of spare robot parts, starts sounding like James Spader talking through a bad cell phone connection and decides that the best way to save the world is to exterminate humanity. Uh-oh. It takes all the Avengers to slow him down for a minute or two. Ultron, he of the high intelligence in the digital format, can escape into any computer in the world – or all of them. Besides that, he has help. A pair of genetically-enhanced twins, Quicksilver / Pietro Maximoff (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and Scarlet Witch / Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen), have a personal beef with the Avengers and are more than happy to help Ultron destroy them. Quicksilver makes Superman look like an old man with a walker and Scarlet Witch can move objects by waving her hands and can get inside someone's head more effectively than any woman I've ever met. Ultron uses their particular set of skills to significant advantage, but he hasn't told them that he has a little more on his high-tech mind than just getting rid of the Avengers. But the good guys have help too. Several characters from previous films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe show up to lend a hand. I'd love to tell you who they are, but my policy is to not reveal anything that you can't learn from the trailer or the movie poster. I'd also love to tell you what we learn about several characters' back stories and the surprising developments involving some of the characters in the present, but that would spoil the fun! And ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" IS a lot of fun! This movie contains all the elements that made the first film work so well, but never gets repetitious. This movie even enhances those elements. We get more character development, more character conflict, more humor, superior visual effects and, most importantly, an even better story and even better action sequences! What's not to love? The visuals are stunning, the action sequences are intense and creative, and there are more laughs in this movie than in many so-called comedies I've seen. The humor is not only perfectly balanced with the action, it's perfectly timed. This film will leave superhero fans and action movie fans alike wanting more, and more is on the way. We're going to have a chance to see ""Ant-Man"" in July. ""Captain America: Civil War"" arrives next May, ""Guardians of the Galaxy 2"" and ""Thor: Ragnarok"" in 2017, and ""Avengers: Infinity War – Part 1"" in 2018. For now, ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" gets an ""A"".",9
Marvel shows us DC stands for Departmentof DefenseComics,26 May 2015,"This gets ten stars alone for just not using super hero's to push corporate corruption, government incompetence, and propaganda like DC does. Marvel Studios has made me a fan of super hero movies before Iron Man I never would have spent any time watching comic book movies even if I had free promo tickets and now I go and see them all in the theater. These film have real American values attached to them and hold freedom and individuality to the highest esteem. Unlike dc they deal with consequences of actions, individuality, and expressing who you are and what you believe in while dc films at their best have pushed propaganda for major corporations made excuses for government spying and the desecration of our constitution. Example batman with Nolan placing centralized banks in every commercial and plot line. DC you should just sell all your film rights over to Marvel Studios and let them show you how it is supposed to be done.",10
Team work makes the dream work!,19 November 2023,"For yet another mission, the Avengers have reconnected. I adored watching the group work together, relying on one another's strengths and defending one another. Since recovering the scepter was already challenging it seemed bizarre that Stark would develop a program behind everyone's back that would eventually need to be destroyed. With his unwavering leadership and optimism that they would go undefeated as a team, Captain America was the only one who could keep the team cohesive. The introduction of the new Avengers, The Scarlet Witch and Vision, as well as their backstories, was fascinating to watch. I can't wait to see what's next.",10

To much is too Much!,20 July 2016,"I am not a comic fan and neither have the Idea what heroes there are. First,the movie before is much better than this one! There are not these funny moments when the bad guy says something mad and suddenly Hulk knocks him ultra fast and unexpected....I mean when I was watching a movie I almost knew what would happen certain scenes and with that the Film lose on the quality cuz If I'm sure what's gonna happen in a movie..then I have to say this movie don't deserve the name ""Blockbuster"" or anything like this. Oh...and again as we all know,Hulk is the Greatest hero,strongrst and bulletproof so in theory he can beat ANYBODY!

all in all another great action movie.",8
Dark,3 March 2019,"Very dark,but a very enjoyable movie as well. This movie brings in a few new characters, and certainly has all the action someone would want in a superhero movie",8
Age Of Ultron ROCKS..... Way better than the first!,16 May 2015,"In my humble opinion, the first Avengers was good, but not one of Marvel's best...LIKE THIS!!! Age Of Ultron is truly an Avengers film and is one of the best superhero films of all time. Granted, the inventor creates something that goes haywire plot is a tad predictable, and Quicksilver is not a character that you will care about. Other than that, this film is golden! The action is definitely better than the original, I was on the edge of my seat at some points.... but how can I not mention the Hulkbuster scene?! It's just amazing from start to finish, and it mixes humor and fighting very well. The 3D is also extremely cool, most namely the opening action scene, which had a shot that got butterflies in my stomach. The comedy is consistently laugh-out loud funny, especially the Hulk gets punched several times one(the whole entire theater was laughing like crazy when that came along). I was also impressed by Ultron, who is both a ruthless villain who wants to destroy the world and a lovable robot that cracks several funny jokes. The characters will pull your emotional strings because of how well-written they are, and will leave you with a grin when they fight. Age Of Ultron is a must-see for everyone and you will be satisfied.",9
The avengers reassemble,3 May 2015,,8
They Couldn't Do It Twice,21 May 2015,"First of all, the first Avengers is great. It is a well written, clever, and well acted movie. It's action scenes are great, it features a god villain, and above all else, it puts many major superheroes into one movie. That was the draw. Seeing all your favorite heroes on screen is what matters. That effect couldn't be replicated. Age of Ultron is not a bad movie by any means, but it also doesn't add anything new. The CGI fight scenes are still good, the heroes still work well together, the comedy is (somewhat) spot on, and the villain is still well written. Ultron simply relies too much on the wow factor that brought its predecessor so much success. The comedy is also up fro debate. It seems unnatural in this movie, almost forced. The characters are sarcastic and witty, but this movie was filled with comedic moments, almost too much so. The jokes fall very flat when the audience is being beaten over the head with them. The finale is also, well, not exciting. If an editor placed the finale of the first Avengers films and this one side by side, there is very little difference. The over the top CGI cluster that is the finale just doesn't seem as exciting after seeing an almost copy paste from the original. Avenger Age of Ultron is a good movie, its a fun movie, but it doesn't bring anything new to the table. Had the film actually brought something new, like a darker plot, or a more interesting plot, or... anything really, the movie would have been great. Unless Marvel stops dumbing down their films, they are going to hit a wall. They need to learn that their most successful films are the ones that are different (ie Guardians of the Galaxy and Captain America: Winter Soldier). If they don't learn this lesson, future films will be just as OK as Age of Ultron, and that is a scary thought.",4

Spoilers Review - Avengers: Age Of Ultron,3 May 2015,,8
Avengers: Age of Bloated,3 May 2015,"Avengers: Age of Ultron is the official start to the summer blockbuster season. And what a start it is. Undoubtedly one of the most hyped movies of the year, it had a lot to deliver, especially after the amazing trailer we saw and all the awesome footage, we were in for a treat.

Or at least we hoped so. Or at least I hoped so.

Well, from the rating I gave it, you would probably think that I certainly enjoyed it. And I really did, actually, I had a lot of fun with it. But fun is not the only thing I look for in a movie. A movie can be fun in a lot of different ways. This movie did it with its great and vivid action scenes, the dynamic CGI, the snarky and smart dialog, and a compelling although rushed villain.

But other than that, I felt something was missing. The first Avengers benefited from a more organized story, the characters had more interaction, and there was more of a conflict, which fleshed the characters out even more (that and that every hero had his own movie) and of course our favorite villain, Loki. Although I gave the first Avengers the same rating, I do think Age of Ultron is a bit of a letdown.

There is not really a story with a lot of surprises, just a string of events that lead to another. This is not really something new in a Marvel movie. We always have the same pattern of a story. A villain that has an evil plan and needs to be stopped. This is not a problem as long as the movie keeps the viewer invested with other points. Here, the only thing it has going for other than seeing our heroes interact, is one action scene after another that all feel kind of the same. In fact, the action is so bloated and loud, that it was exhausting and boring after a while. Ultrons robot army was just not exciting as a menace at all, they felt weak and useless and not like a threat to the Avengers. The love story between Black Widow and Bruce Banner was something that felt way too forced and out of place. At some point people chuckled because the dialog felt like it was something out of a soap opera. I really hope they improve their character arcs in the following movies.

By now you probably have already seen the movie and made up your mind. As for me, I expected more of a darker and grounded movie that didn't need to feel like every other superhero movie we've seen before. The hype for these movies to me, is very questionable. I'm still looking forward what this series has to offer in the following years, just please, change the formula.",3
More development? Yeah okay,28 April 2019,"Age of Ultron is a great sequel to the original Avengers but not quite better than it. It fits very nicely with the other phase two MCU films in that it serves to not only introduce new and complex characters, but to also allow for growth. This movie very clearly teaches the Avengers as a group that they must work together and be honest with each other in order to have the best chance of succeeding. The villain, while not terribly clever, does run with a plan and has morals that make sense. It is always good to have a villain that believes what they are doing is right. The stakes, while not alien level of dangerous, still feel impactful and provide tension. This movie also features maybe the best scene in the MCU when we get to clearly see the cast as friends instead of just heroes.

SPOILERS: I find it amazing that this movie manages to introduce us to a new character, turn him to the good side, and then kill him off all in one movie. I would expect the death to feel less impactful because of those reasons, but it definitely isn't.",8
Awesome job on it!,9 December 2019,"Despite the challenge of having to top their first Avengers film, Marvel did beautifully and the result was amazing. I hope to see more films like this in the future.",10
Not A Perfect Film But Very Enjoyable,10 August 2018,,8
"Not as good as the first, but an epic sequel",14 April 2022,,8
Disappointing,21 May 2015,"OK

I bought a 3d TV JUST because I wanted to watch The Avengers at home. I watched it so many times - the bluray became blurry! This was after having watched it three times with different people in the cinema!

Fast forward with pee-holding excitement to Avengers 2: Age of Ultron. How can I summarise this without boring you with a shopping list? Basically: Everything right about the first Avengers - was MISSING in this one. As promised - I'll stop complaining there.

LOVED Paul Bettany though. He was superb as always in whatever he appears in! As was - surprisingly - Elizabeth Olsen (and I thought she'd be terrible - but she was actually excellent. All fragile, deadly, heartfelt, deep, angst-ridden, quiet rage and fear).

Overall? Put the soul back into the next one please. Missing the character development and warmth of a Whedon picture. Oh yeah - and please bring back Loki. Thanks X",2
GOOF,4 January 2019,"At 1:43 Captain america catches a civilian who is thrown by Thor, Cap drops down and holds onto the rock with his right arm catching the lady in his left arm. He jumps up to get nearer the top with his right arm. On the next shot 1:43:12 Cap drops his right arm to keep hold of the lady: meaning he is no longer holding the rock. The next shot shows his right arm holding back onto the rock.",8
The best of MCU's Phase II,6 May 2019,"The Good: Avengers: Age of Ultron balances lots, introducing a new villain which is probably the best villain in the MCU so far. beginning the Infinity War plot line (which was very interesting) and introducing new characters, (which were quite likeable) but it never gets dizzying, it all fits together perfectly. Action scenes are awesome and jokes are funny! Also Hawkeye stole the show!

The Bad: Some bad CGI here and there, and Tony Stark got aggravating in this one.

Overall, Age of Ultron was an awesome entry in the MCU (the best since the first Captain America) A must see!",9
Awesome movie still,6 November 2019,"Movie was great but felt like there was just too much action and fighting. The creativity of the choreography gets lost in the whirlwind of action and this I noticed most in Captain America's scenes. He does like a hundred different awesome things with his shield, but you don't have time to really take it in because you're already looking at Iron Man blasting 20 Ultron-bots to bits.",9

"Seriously,guys?",21 June 2015,"What were people expecting from this movie? The Godfather Part 2? No, you went into a Marvel movie that was advertised as a fun superhero movie. I really don't get the low ratings

Positives: The action scenes are great and see these heroes working together that we only saw a glimpse of in The Avengers. One standout scene is the Hulk v Hulkbuster fight in South Africa which has balls to the wall fun and contained a lot of laughs. The characters are better than even here. There were many complaints about the first movie not having character development and what do people do? Complain about 20 minutes of screen time is dedicated to developing Black Widow, Hulk and Hawkeye as characters which is great since these characters don't have standalone movies. Iron Man and Cap. are given enough conflict to set up Civil War and Thor is at his funniest in this film. The newcomers to the team, Quicksilver and Scarlett Witch are also great additions to the teams as well as Vision played by Paul Bettany, he steals a lot of scenes and I sure will not spoil him for you, if you've never heard of the character.

The villain of Ultron played by James Spader is great. He's more a neglected son of Tony Stark in his sarcastic and witty mannerisms but also serves as a great threat but I would have liked to see his motivations to destroy the world explained a bit more. The plot is good enough. Tony creates a AI named Ultron to keep world peace and to basically guard the Earth while the Avengers are retired. This backfires when Ultron decides the only path to peace is the extinction of not only the Avengers but all human kind. The humour here is top form and really shows the chemistry between every member of the team and for some truly laugh out loud moments.

Negatives: 3D is a flippin' rip off. The 3D could of been really capitalised on in the action scenes but is just a cash grab Vision's powers aren't fully explained. Thor's sub-plot feels rather underwhelming.

Conculsion Avengers 2 is a boat load is freaking fun and everything a summer blockbuster should be. It also really makes me look forward to the expansion of this Marvel universe and where we could go.",9
A multilayered saga,19 March 2019,"This Avengers is more layered which makes it feel longer and may cause the restless to loose interest but the transitions are well placed, paced and contain some poignant moments, deepening the story. The cast just gets more star studded, all bringing great performances. Joss Whedon is just the best at crafting his stories and because he is such a fanboy of his subject we get lots nice little touches, like the machine (Ultron) that needs an audience (first the Twins and later the Black Widow) and the twist on who is worthy to weld Mjolnir (Thor's Hammer). The stop action montages are beautifully crafted (I wanted to say they are 'rad', but I didn't want to be accused of age appropriation). There is a wonderful balance of big grand moments and nice little personal moments and still the trademark wit that sets the tone. Although my least favourite of the Avengers combo packs, upon rewatching it still comes close to the bar. I give this film a 9 (superb) out of 10 {Superheroes Action Adventure}",9

Great action-packed film,9 December 2019,"Compared to the first movie, this one was much more fast-paced and had more action scenes in it. We don't see a lot of character development but it's still enjoyable!",9
"Not perfect, but still an extremely enjoyable superhero flick",2 January 2018,"Avengers 2 starts off very fast-paced - you're already in the midst of a battle and one of the first exchanges is a hilarious back-and-forth between Iron Man (Downey Jr.) and Captain America (Evans). It at once sets the scene for a great action film, but also helps to quickly re-introduce characters and their personalities. It's not essential to have seen the first movie, or even the 'Thor', 'Iron Man' or 'Captain America' films (and even 'Guardians of the Galaxy'), but they definitely help to add another layer of nuance and understanding to some events/characters.

The plot is pretty straight forward - Iron Man wants to protect the world by having his automated suits everywhere. This inadvertently creates artificial intelligence, which turns out to be Ultron (Spader) - who wants to protect Earth by helping it to evolve. This obviously involves wiping out the human species! The Avengers can't handle him - and with Scarlet Witch (Olsen) and Quicksilver (Taylor-Johnson/Kick-Ass) on his side (before they see his true intentions) - they have to re-group and learn to all work together again. The introduction of Vision (Bettany) is handled well and is a welcome one for future films.

One of the best aspects of this film is the characterisation - each Avenger gets some backstory and exposition, not just fight scenes. Hawkeye (Renner) probably comes off the best here, since he's often overlooked - he is after all just a guy who's a good archer! The Black Widow (Johansson) and Hulk (Ruffalo) 'romance' is odd and new, but doesn't necessarily work. However, it's good seeing Thor (Hemsworth), Iron Man and Captain America work as part of a team - especially when Thor and ""Cap"" combine to take out dozens of enemies at once! Spader's voice is great as the voice of discontent with the human species. While the ending is a little reminiscent of 'Superman Returns', the film takes you on an entertaining ride through the Marvel universe - I still look forward to the next instalment(s)!",8

A roller-coaster that still has soul,5 August 2015,"WHAT I LIKED: A movie of such size that still has soul. 'Age of Ultron' truly is massive, an ambitious round of great, explosive action, special effects, setup and an incredible (and massive) cast. But Whedon manages to pull all that together in a way that the movie still feels personal. This is thanks to his level of characterisation and relationship development which bring some realism to the overall spectacle, giving the audience excitement, awe and buckets emotions throughout. In fact, by far the best scenes here are where the Avengers just talk, grounding everything ready for more incredible action. And because of this roller coaster ride, 'Avengers 2' has to be the MCU's best film to date. Nothing like it brings together everything great about all the films and comics we love like this does. Well done Whedon. WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE: Perhaps the reason for this film's overall average reception is the marketing campaign, which built expectations for an entirely different film. Without that, 'Age of Ultron' only really falters with small things. In a film this ambitious, there are bound to be niggles (Thor's cave etc.) But the beauty of it is that they hardly take away from the overall experience at all. VERDICT: The MCU's best film is a thrilling, beautiful roller coaster. Whedon steers it with perfection - and achieves a blockbuster with real soul.",10

Excellent comic book superhero movie,29 April 2015,"This is a great film, I've seen it twice and cannot understand the hate, maybe people expect to much from a film about superheroes in a comic? Sure its a bit similar to the first, but what do you expect its about a team of heroes trying to stop world destruction, heck even the upcoming infinity war movies will be similar in this fact except the Avengers will be saving the universe not just earth.

For me the film had tons of action, all of which had great special effects, the humour was good, but not to much (like some people seem to think!!) it is for me the best MCU film to date and the best superhero movie to date.",10
Marvel did great!,25 November 2019,"If you read the comics, you'll see that this isn't just another direct copy and paste of the storyline. Marvel is great enough to make some changes",9
It's really great!... Except it isn't really that great,29 December 2018,"COME ON!!! This was a movie with such potential. It was thought of with good intentions, but was built incorrectly. Not badly, just incorrectly. An example of why I thought of this is because of Ultron's intention. It would've been much better if Ultron actually did what he was programmed to do: protect humans. I mean, if Ultron couldn't kill humans, this would present a conflict that Ultron needs to get past to accomplish his goal. Other than that, here is how I rated this movie:

Cast - 7 -> The cast is quite amazing. They make this story-wise terrible movie half-decent. Story - 5 -> Like I 've said, the story was built terribly, but with good intention, therefore it gets a higher rating than it might've gotten. CGI - OVER 9000!!!! (9) -> Let's just not get into this. It's great. Period. Characters - 10 - Of course the characters are great! The Avengers themselves consists of great characters including Iron-Man and Thor, and characters like Ultron and Scarlet Witch are just bomb (good bomb).

Alright. It's an OK film. That's that.",8
Avengers as...!,21 June 2022,"Avengers: Age of Ultron. Avengers as...! Joss Whedon returned as director of the second part and decided to slightly change the approach to the sequel. The new threat is not as massive as Loki's attack, but it makes the Avengers sweat a lot. The new characters fit perfectly into the universe and are sure to stay for a long time.",9
underwhelming,1 May 2015,"So i think part of what makes a super hero movie great is the dichotomy between your hero(es) and your villain(s).

I felt like the threat of an Ultron being virtually any and everywhere would create an inescapable feeling. Instead Ultron was more like Link from Zelda. Other than his infinite re-spawn capability this villain didn't scare me.

Now Scarlet witch on the other hand singlehandedly kept the avengers at bay. Where is a bigger more exploitative use of her evil side...that may have made for a better bad guy than Ultron.

To summarize, I never felt like our heroes were in mortal danger. The most difficult thing the Avengers had to face is evacuating civilians. Which for the record took about 25% of the movie.",4
A good movie that needs to be seen twice,19 May 2015,"This movie has been anticipate since the first teaser trailer came out last year. I have to say it did not disappoint. It bought the team back with an amazing action sequence where the avengers were facing off against a Hydra base. In the first two week of Avenger Age of Ultron I saw it twice. Once in 2D and once in 3D. Both time I was sitting in a good spot not too far away and not too close. This allowed me to catch all the action throughout the movie.

All six avengers are back with the same actors playing them. Tony Stark (Robert Downy Jr.), Captain America (Chris Evans), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Bruce Banner/ Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner). In the first scene we also meet the Maximoff Twin also known as Scarlett Witch and Quicksilver who are enhanced humans who have been artificially created.

After this first scene everything starts to cool down as Tony and Bruce try to make Ultron an artificial intelligence program that they want to make to protect the world. Well they succeed and Ultron is not what they expected instead of helping the human race he see them as a threat to the earth. So I'm guessing you know where this is going.

Things go wrong and it up to the avengers to stop him. Now there is the context and I do not want to spoil the movie. This movie is in the middle of the Marvel cinematic universe so it is here to set up so many movie in the future. For example there is a scene in the home country of the Black Panther who has a movie that is to be released in 2018. It also starts the tension between Tony Stark and Steve Rogers that is going to lead to the events that are going to happen in Captain America: Civil War. This movie for what is here to do is great but it's a filler movie to bring in new character and set up plot for other movies to come. Think of it like an ending scene at the end of the other Marvel movie but it's a whole movie. It's here to satisfy the fan so that they don't start saying ""Where the next Avengers Movie."" It bring together part that people are excited to see with many character that are to be seen.

The action is great and the story is good for people who know about comics and the story line that are coming up. You know what all the hints are in the movie. A major complaint I have is that it moves so fast once you get into one storyline and you're interested in that, the movie does a 360 on you and goes somewhere completely different. But this movie has made me excited for the movies to come so I am torn whether that was a complaint or a good thing in the movie. By the time you leave the movie theater your head is spinning I had to go see it twice to under enough understanding to write this. But I also understand why there were rushed story lines because they had a lot to get through in two and half hour movie even that is not enough time you can see where there are plot hole and where scenes were cut out. I want to see an extended director cut which in total honesty would probably increase the movies time by half an hour to a full hour which is the time they need to fix all the plot holes that come up.

Overall this was a great movie in my opinion but it's a set up movie it there to set up movie in the future which I am not complaining about I want the movie in the future and have a movie to set up all the movies in the future is fine by me. I personally would watch it again just so that I don't miss any of the details.",8
Robots step on the throats of heroes,19 July 2022,"The sequel to ""The Avengers"", the continuation of the all-hero film from 2012, a new serious enemy and again the danger of complete destruction. All this represents the ""Age of Ultron"".

But as often happens, the viewer, watching the sequel, necessarily looks back at the original. In this case, it was a movie that made a splash. And it was quite difficult to surpass him. Probably, and failed.

Jos Whedon enters the arena to tell a full-fledged story of the confrontation between artificial intelligence and a team of superheroes. There is no point in telling which of the Avengers is which. In fact, we have already seen two solo films about almost everyone. Therefore, it was important to reveal those characters who have not yet received enough screen time, to introduce the audience to new characters. And the director does it successfully. There is also a love line between the Hulk and the Black Widow, which shows us both from a new side, makes us worry with them, because they are primarily people who are not just fighting evil, but also have their own problems, experience certain hardships.

An excellent option turned out to be to show the life of a Hawkeye. After all, the character does not have his own soloists, but is very important to the team. And many people wanted to know his story.

The rest, as always, are cool, strong. The actors playing the Avengers continue to show the development of their heroes and do it very well.

The film is replete with action, literally from the first frames sending you into an amazing world of adventures. The viewer waits for this and gets it, enjoys it and waits for even more entertainment. And he definitely gets it. What I like about Marvel movies, they will definitely find a way to surpass themselves in the visual component, plot twists and collisions of heroes among themselves. This time we were pleased with the Hulk and Iron Man, whose ""sparring"" can be reviewed hundreds of times, enjoying the coolness and humor.

Ultron is good. Flat in his motivation, but good. He analyzes what has already happened and offers his ""world here and now"". But his methods are clearly not suitable for Earthlings. The main concept of the whole saga - the infinity stones - is very skillfully attached to this story of confrontation. I think this is a very interesting move by the screenwriters. They show the viewer their independent story with Ultron, but they do not miss the cherished McGuffins. And this reminds the viewer that there is a future ahead of this local conflict, albeit cruel, in which it will be even more interesting.

""Age of Ultron"" adequately completes the second phase, prepares us for the future world in the cinematic universe. The film is dynamic, beautiful, strong, and the characters in it develop, new ones appear. Everything is done with love and desire. And when this happens, the audience also loves the resulting product.

Essential midpoint that sets up a decade of stories,7 July 2024,"Avengers: Age of Ultron

We are at the midpoint of the linked up MCU movies, and Age of Ultron starts to bring some of the plot points together. I'll admit that I didn't like this movie the first time through as it felt random and unnecessary. It almost felt like they just did Avengers just to do Avengers. But knowing about further movies down the line, this film got so much better.

We have the first mention of Wakanda and the Vibranium arms dealer Klaue. It's nice that sharp eyed viewers will see him again in Black Panther.

The infinity stones are talked about a bit more than their mention in Guardians of the Galaxy. Thor's vision from Wanda leads him to find the information.

Wanda and the Vision meet for the first time, and it's heartbreaking knowing what's to come. Pietro's heroic ending hits different writing about this in 2024. I can go on for paragraphs about Wanda, but that'll save for later.

Stan Lee gets to drink Thor's Asgardian booze, wearing a WW2 hat, and it's delightful to see him stumble. I also enjoyed everyone trying to pick up Thor's hammer only for the unexpected to happen near the end.

While watching this movie, I was shocked at the collateral damage that went on in Sokovia at the beginning, and of course the ending, plus the destruction that takes place in Africa when Wanda hexes the Hulk. They really need the sad walking away music from the 70s Incredible Hulk tv show for when he goes into hiding after the shame of that rampage.

Tony Stark's hex vision continues to show that he has not yet recovered from the mental strain of nearly dying blowing up the Chitauri. I talked about this briefly in Iron Man 3, but this time it has more dire consequences because it leads directly to the creation of Ultron. Tony wants a robot to keep the peace of normal threats while the super powered Avengers can prevent another alien invasion. His fear of being powerless to save his friends, hidden behind bravado, is so strong that it's a wonder he doesn't collapse from the stress.

Clint's family was a surprise, but fit so well in the story. It's brings about the human factor that I write about in all of my Marvel movie reviews. The team hiding there briefly helps with the growing rift between the team due to the Ultron secret, and the loss of JARVIS. Seeing his family stay safe grounds everyone and is a reminder that not everything is in chaos.

A great movie on its own, it completely succeeds as part of the huge storyline with so much setup. The mass destruction in New York from the first Avengers movie, plus the Sokovia/Ultron situation, have an excellent fallout when we next see the team. After seeing it 4 or 5 times, I now find it one of my favorites just for the little pieces that get developed later.",8
Beastly awesome,30 June 2019,"Cap, wow Cap. Best part of this movie.

Some phenomenal action, including one of the best scenes ever. But a little sloppy at times. Very funny. Went deeper into some of the characters. Awesome continuation of the MCU storyline. Bad-ass, interesting and different villain, I only wish I saw more of him, more development of his character.

really great,22 August 2017,,10
#Movie Review,2 August 2021,"Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015) is an action packed movie with some minor flaws. The plot feels a bit disconnected and rushed, there are too many things added, thus Ultron never gets the chance to be set up as a real threat. Also another bad thing happened due to the increased number of heroes : nobody got enough screen time.

Nevertheless we still got a solid movie in which we can see the heroes we love in action!",8
The Golden Age of Marvel movies is OVER,5 May 2015,"This is a perfect example of how success can ruin a franchise. So much money is changing hands now that the Marvel movies are quickly descending into the pattern of dumbing down - attempting to satisfy the masses, resulting in inferior product.

While still somewhat enjoyable, the movie suffers from MANY flaws, and not all are the fault of Marvel/Disney - some are to be laid at the feet of Joss Whedon, justifying my initial fears of having the tween darling master of the Buffy-verse in charge of these films.

Specifically, the love stories Whedon fought so hard to include are stultifying and sleep-inducing - or just downright Lucas-level stupid. The dream sequences he championed are also all but useless time-killers.

The movie is loaded with SO MANY one-liners, it's impossible to take anything seriously, and the jokes become tiresome. Ultron is less a world threat, and more a sardonic stand up comedian. Everyone seems to want a piece of the popularizing Stark humor (even though a Stark spoken rape joke backfired horribly with feminist audience members).

There are some excellent action sequences, while at the same time there are several overdone CGI scenes that are almost unwatchable, much like a Michael Bay film.

The addition of Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch do absolutely nothing for the movie. Both actors give incredibly boring performances, and the power set of Scarlet Witch is unrecognizable in comparison to her comic book counterpart. Baron Von Strucker is also rendered completely useless after quite a bit of build up in previous films and TV.

The character of Black Widow is basically reduced to a whore (for the Red Room, for Nick Fury, whatever).

The brightest spot in the whole film is The Vision. They achieved something special with the creation and execution of that character.

Again, it wasn't entirely unenjoyable. I love these characters and am amazed to living in a time when I get to see them on the big screen, but with all these glaring flaws, I can only give it a 5 out of 10.

I am now very leery of all Marvel films going forward, and expect nothing more than a ""joke-explosion-joke-explosion-joke-lame love story- joke-explosion"" formula to dominate all future projects.",5
Solid Movie,2 November 2023,"The team is back! For anyone who watches the marvel movies/series in chronological order, this one is a real treat.

The movie had a perfect balance to it. Riddled with great jokes, witty lines, action, romance and lots of friendship. I loved the chemistry between the cast they really did feel like a bunch of friends.

Finally some new superhero's in the mix. Wanda really stands out. This movie is her introduction. Right off the hop she has a fun new ability to complicate everything. Playing with the hero's minds. It was fun to see what each of them saw and how it moved then to make certain decisions. Along side her super speedy brother. They don't give enough story to both of them, but it felt like they were leaving room for what's to come. Vision is one of my favs. He's so smooth and kind. Wants to save the world but knows they are doomed. His powers are quite extraordinary.

The movie being 141min it flies by so fast. The plot is interesting, the cast phenomenal. The chemistry is great. I loved how they brought Bruce and the Widow together. She used to be so afraid of him in the first Avenger movie. And yet here they are. We also get to take a further look into the personal lives of Barton and Natasha.

Above all the script was fantastic. So funny. ""The city is flying. We're fighting robots. And I have a bow. None of this makes any sense.""",9
"""But if you step out that door, you are an Avenger""",30 April 2017,"Almost two years ago, when this was being released, I was the most excited Marvel fanboy you could imagine. The entire Marvel Cinematic Universe had grown on me immensely and had become a franchise that I went back to time and time again and this film was being released just as my inner nerd was evolving. The very first time I saw this I was disappointed, actually. It wasn't everything I had hoped it was, but I still enjoyed it very much. Then came the release of it's blu- ray and I picked it up day 1 to see if my thoughts had changed at all, and it turns out that I watched it three times in the same week and I just admired the film.

After my realization that this wasn't going to be as good as The Avengers is where, I think, I truly found my love for this. Every time I saw it on I would sit down and watch it, or every time I was bored I popped it in and it just was so re-watchable to me. You see the thing that made the first one so amazing was the fact that it had been what Marvel Studios' was trying to do since the beginning and felt like a true experience. Avengers: Age of Ultron kept that experience like feel, but somewhere deep down it didn't feel as ""cinematic"" as the first.

Returning to his rightful place, Joss Whedon once again sits in the directors chair for this outing and I actually think he did a better job here, in the direction aspect at least. In The Avengers, Whedon's writing ability is easily the best part; being able to have all these characters combine and he made all of them feel real. The writing in this, while fantastic, didn't have that charm of the first where it felt like a combining movie. He didn't have to set the chemistry up so I think that's why it's not as good. Anyways the direction though in Age of Ultron is better in my opinion.

With grand landscapes and gorgeous set pieces gracing the screen, the MCU hasn't looked this beautiful in awhile. Each thin shown or even referenced has a purpose and makes the film even more compelling. The action is some of the best and I think it doesn't get the love it deserves, in the action department, because Mad Max: Fury Road was released the same year. The entire first sequence is done to perfection and the final battle is a marvelous piece of filmmaking. Each part is shot beautifully and the close, but effective, editing makes for the 141 minute runtime fly by.

Like I said above, the way that Whedon wrote the Avengers themselves in the first one was phenomenally done. It's hard to balance all these characters and their individual arcs, but Whedon does it effectively and does it with such ease. Thanks to the actors though, they all combine to brings these characters to screen once again and I fanboy every time. Robert Downey Jr. being cocky as all hell, Chris Evans being a buff dude, Mark Ruffalo using a code green, and Jeremy Renner stealing the show from all of them with his jokes and inspiration, makes me smile and proves just how much I love these people. I always see complaints about Spader's Ultron, but to me he was perfect. He felt menacing, and the quick jokes just show how ""human"" he actually is.

Even after my 6th! viewing Joss Whedon's superhero extravaganza of a sequel, Avengers: Age of Ultron, has become quite possibly the most under loved, and under appreciated film within the entire MCU. My initial reaction to the film was poor, but after so many thoughts and talks I've had about the deep love I have for, not just the film itself, but the entire franchise and how it all fits together, has made me admire Joss Whedon's sequel and everything it does. From Hawkeyes kickass speech to Hulk vs. Hulkbuster, Avengers: Age of Ultron marks as one of the best superhero films ever and one that makes me want to throw a fist in the air.",8

Not the greatest but love new heros,19 August 2019,,9
Clunk Junk,11 May 2015,"(Rating: ☆☆ out of 4)

This film is not recommended.

In brief: This film may be critic-proof, but it is also fun-proof.

GRADE: C

Believe it or not, this is actually the 11th Marvel film about superheroes. Yes, they have taken moviegoers into the comic book cosmos, with varying results, and made their films one of the most profitable series in movie history. Reviews seem pointless as the movie is critic-proof in its popularity. Avengers: Age of Ultron is also fun-proof.

￼Now let me begin my review by admitting to a bias: I am not really enamored by superhero movies. While I do usually find them entertaining and mildly diverting, I do enjoy the CGI artistry involved. I don't follow the historical and mythological angles of these comic book heroes and their mystical powers, nor do I much comprehend their hierarchy in the superhero food chain. Just show me the money in your big budget with your CGI! On that matter, the film does not disappoint.

￼Adequately directed by Joss Whedon, Avengers: Age of Ultron gathers this motley crew of crusaders together once more to rescue the world from annihilation, although our heroes do a pretty good job of destroying many metropolises and injuring countless innocent bystanders in order to save them and mankind. (Perhaps they should try a little less harder next go-round.)

Once more we have Ironman (Robert Downey, Jr.), too snarly and uptight this round, The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) with those expandable briefs and those patented stretchy trousers, Captain America (Chris Evans) with no shirtless scene for the gay crowd to Marvel (shame!), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) looking great in head to toe leather, Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) with his non-stop supply of arrows, and Thor with hammer and grimace in tow. Plus some secondary avengers are now added to the mix but just take up more screen time from the primary A-team and contribute little to the film: Aaron Taylor-Johnson as Quicksilver, aptly named for his speed, Elizabeth Olsen as Wanda Maximoff a.k.a. Scarlet Witch, who has the power of mind control but had very little control of her fluctuating Russian accent, and Paul Betthany as Vision, although I had some trouble understanding his whole superpowers and identity. It's all more of the same clang-bang-shoot-em-up from that old gang of ours.

￼The thin story, also written by Whedon, has Tony Stark a.k.a. Ironman center stage as he uses the elusive Loki specter to create an artificial intelligence, namely Ultron (wonderfully voiced by James Spader), to help him and his cronies battle the ongoing forces of evil. Of course, Tony's ideal robot buddy has other ideas and more destruction and mayhem ensues.

￼The battles are plentiful, six rather long combat scenes by my count, enough to please most young fan-boys and gamers in the audience, or anyone under the age of 10. There's more screen time per battle than there is in dialog or character development, although Whedon does try to give some back-story to some characters and romantic involvement between two of the Avengers (strictly boy/girl stuff). Between the ethical debates about war and peace between Stark and Captain America, or his foe Ultron, the film really has no point of view. It just keeps moving on, with its main purpose to show oodles of badly staged combat that either highlights shaky camera-work that obscures the action and movement of the actors or it relies on slo-mo aerial ballet moments for dramatic effects. The pacing is set at either of those two extremes with little in-between.

￼The film takes itself far too seriously. What made previous outings so popular and effective were the humorous asides and ironic conversations between these misfits, a factor totally missing in this film except for an amusing moment involving Thor's heavy hammer and a plummeting action sequence between Ironman and the Hulk that supplies the film's sparse laughs.

Noisy and clunky, Avengers: Age of Ultron is mindlessly numbing pop entertainment that seemed more desperate to please its audience with its state-of-the art imagery that supply any logic or pleasure to any of its human characters or any moviegoer with an average IQ for that matter.

HAVE EPIC MOMENTS BUT...,25 April 2019,"Joss Whedon's second Avengers movie Age of Ultron is a good transition to new phase in this cinenatic universe. Im writing this review after seeing it 3rd time. No doubt, it is better than first Avengers movie visually. But if we talk about storytelling and deepness of event and new characters, especially after watching Avengers: Infinity War I can't say amazing things. It has so epic moments, especially I hyped so much at final. Tonight Im gonna watch Avengers: Endgame and I wanna thank Marvel Entertainment for making this universe so beautifully.

Ps: James Spader is amazing as Ultron.",8
A great avengers sequel,2 January 2019,"While trying to create a new entity which could have sent Earth's security to a whole new level, Stark and Banner accidentally unleash a mighty force which threatens the lives of everyone. As the new force is much fearsome than expected, the Avengers must overcome their differences and try to work together, especially when two new ""modified"" characters seem to join the other side.

As it is an Avengers movie, you pretty much get what you were looking for. Plenty of great and very well-known characters, each with their own traits and charisma, whose forces combine into a lot of action-packed scenes which generate plenty of thrill and of course, awesomeness! It's one of those movies which make every child's dreams come true. It's quite hard to miss when you put such great superheroes into one movie and it surely didn't. The acting is also a very positive aspect as the also very well-known actors play their parts flawlessly but also contributing substantially to the great atmosphere that the movie is able to create.

The story it features is quite good, but as far as I'm concerned, it represents the downside of this movie, or better said, the only part which made it shy of the maximum rating. Don't get me wrong, it's far from bad, but you get the feeling that it could have done a lot more in order to make the movie truly great. Its predictability in some cases and its linearity in others kind of spoil the overall great sensation that the movie brings.

In terms of visuals, you can barely find something to dislike. It looks so good, the stunts and their filming angles make it look great while maintaining a realism factor. The CGI is also top-notch, making almost everything you can imagine a reality. Thus, it gets a big appreciation from me regarding this department.

As a conclusion, I can say that it's a movie worthy of the Avengers franchise which delivers what it promised to but was a bit dragged down by its story. Nevertheless, it's a movie which deserves to be seen without any doubt.",9

"Important in the MCU, maybe not on its own",21 March 2020,"Age of Ultron when it was released I gave it 6/10, on rewatching on what comes after its an incredibly important part if not the most of the whole series of films. It sets up pretty much everything that comes after.",8

Sequel Sizzles,3 May 2015,"I was ultra excited to see Age of Ultron. I even read the story arc by Marvel ahead of time. I wanted to be intimately familiar with the story before watching so that nothing would escape me.

Although the movie veered from the story arc a bit, it was still good. Ultron was formidable and I loved James Spader being the voice of Ultron. His voice was menacing when needed, cryptic when needed and even jocular. I thought a jocular Ultron was unnecessary but I could see how the levity angle would go over well with kids.

There were new characters introduced, which is always a treat. And nothing allows the Avengers to display their talents better than the entire world being in jeopardy.

The movie started off with excitement. Right away we were thrust into a battle between the Avengers and Hydra. Things just got more intense from there with small pockets interspersed throughout the movie so the viewers could exhale.

There was something for every fan. Iron-Man fans got healthy doses of Iron-Man, Thor fans likewise, Hulk got some nice screen time, as did Cap, Hawk-eye and Natasha. Some of the better scenes were the team work between Thor and Captain America. And as I mentioned before, we got to see some new characters bring their unique skills to the table.

Age of Ultron was a solid follow up to The Avengers. I'm reluctant to call it as good as the first, but when so many sequels are abysmally bad this sequel shined pretty bright.",8

"Too many jokes and explosions, but not much of anything else.",15 May 2015,"'Avengers: Age of Ultron' is the 11th installment to the MCU franchise and a sequel to the 2012 smash hit, Avenger's Assemble. It stars Chris Evans, Robert Downey Jr, Chris Hemsworth, Jeremy Renner, Scarlett Johansson, Mark Ruffalo and James Spader as Ultron. Both written and directed by Joss Whedon.

In this movie we start with the team invading Baron Von Strucker's base of operations in the fictional country of Sokovia, as he is in the possession of Loki's scepter. A weapon that is capable of some pretty powerful stuff. The Avengers need to get it back as it is deadly when in the wrong hands. When they make it back to stark tower Tony Stark (RDJ) realizes he can use it to kick start is 'Ultron' Initiative. A peace keeping program that is supposed to protect the earth from any outside intruders (Aliens etc). Things do not go to plan and instead of creating something to protect them, Tony ends up creating an artificial intelligence hell bent on destroying the Avengers.

Let us start with Ultron. Now I never watched any of the trailers as I wanted to go into this movie with every scene completely new in my mind. After the movie finished I decided to then go and watch all the trailers. I must say, that in my opinion the trailers made Utron to be a lot more menacing and threatening than he actually was on screen. Now he wasn't a terrible villain unlike *cough* Malaketh *cough*. But he wasn't exactly great either. Most of the destruction of the team actually came from the twins Pietro and Wanda Maximoff aka Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch, mainly Wanda. He could have been a bad ass who could finally be the one to push the Avengers, he just wasn't.

While Ultron himself was not terrible one thing was, his development. There is little to no development for him, whatsoever. So he thinks that he's trying to save the world when he's in fact doing the opposite. Yes, they gave him personality, which to be fair wasn't that hard to do as he's pretty much just a Tony Stark 2.0. His motives were stupid, he goes from realizing he's an AI to wanting to destroy the world within a 10 second time frame. It is a a shame as he could have been the greatest villain in the MCU, not to be THAT guy, but that still belongs to Loki.

Another thing I didn't really like was the relationship between Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson) and Banner (Mark Ruffalo). While it did kind of serve a purpose and added to the movie I just found the whole thing to be forced. You could bring up a point that it happened long before the time period of this movie, but given the conversation during the party that seems impossible to be the case. The conversation itself was also kind of cringy IMO. i had a ""what the hell"" face throughout the entire scene.

Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) was a bad ASS in this movie. Throughout most of the first Avengers Clint was a puppet being controlled by Loki. The rest of the movie all he did was provide cover from on top of a building, and was pretty much completely out of the action. Not in this movie though. Hawkeye was a front runner throughout most of this movie, he took charge and actually kicked most of the ass. I also love how this movie kind of made fun of the fact that Clint is just a guy and all he does is a fire a bow and arrow. They joke about the fact that they don't really need him when in fact, the biggest joke of all is how much they actually do.

The humour was completely hit and miss for me, but more of the latter. The problem I have with MCU movies, is that apart from Winter Soldier, they're just pretty much comedies. The story of this movie is pretty much, a couple of lines about piece, annihilation and fighting together with about 2 hours of jokes and one liners. They advertised that they were going to go darker with this one. They really didn't. Sure it had elements of darkness but it was pretty much just the same forced crap as usual. They don't need every member of the team cracking wise every 5 seconds, have it more serious, have it more brooding and maybe just have one person as the comic relief not EVERYONE. You can still make a dark movie and still have it lighthearted at parts. The Russo brother did that really well with Winter Soldier and i can't wait to see what they bring to the table for Infinity Wars.

On another positive note the action in this movie was pretty awesome. It is a very entertaining movie. If you just want to go and enjoy a movie, maybe lose a couple of brain cells while you're at it then this is the perfect movie for you. I know it kind of relies on it for the most part but in other cases it's just completely not necessary. If you haven't guessed i'm talking about the CGI. I mean, they CGI'd captain America riding a bike. What is the point of that? That's more pointless than CGing Green Lantern's mask in the 2011 movie of the same name.

Is it the best of the MCU? In my opinion no. Not even close to it. Is it one of the more entertaining movies of the MCU? You bet your ass it is. Chances are, if you loved the first one you will most likely love this one, too.

Verdict: This movie could have been so much more than just mindless entertaining popcorn fodder, but it just didn't really do it for me. 6 out of 10",4
One Of The Best MCU Movies Ever.,2 July 2015,"The Avengers 2: Age of Ultron Review: I was so amazed about why this film really existed in cinemas worldwide. Quite frankly I did not even know why it really needed to. It's just not only one of the best MCU films ever,but also one of the best films of 2015. And yet i believed that it was a lot better than The Avengers 1 which is one of the highest-grossing films of 2012. So how awesome can this film really be? Let's find out. Story:I have been so proud of Joss Whedon for all of the movie he wrote. The plot is so amazing. Yes folks i'm totally dead serious about that. The story wasn't so big without it's own dark and menacing tone. I mean come on, how could you definitely love that kind of tone? In addition, my goodness the screenplay looks so fantastic. So in conclusion all of the story is spectacular. Characters: every single character in the flick is truly unforgettable to watch. And Ultron is one of the best villains in all of movie history. You guys better or better not get in his way. Also Wanda and her brother are twins with superpowers? That is pretty awesome in my book. And would look who got the most screen time in the movie? Captain America you played well for now. All the characters from the film are so very well-acted and trust me when I say that they're all well worth watching. Music: My freaking god. All the music from the flick is so incredible to hear and listen to. And I am for one giving a big kudos to Brian Tyler and Danny Elfman for it. It is also good having Alan Silvestri's themes back for the very first time in a row. I'm more than happy about that. Visaul Effects: All the Special Effects and Visaul Effects are brilliant. And there is absolutely no question about that. The design of the Ultron Sentanls is so cool that I can not ever bear it. Not gonna lie I would not be hurting it so much.

Conclusion: And so all of this is why i definitely love this movie. The Avengers 2: Age of Ultron isn't only one of the best MCU movies ever but also one of the best movies of 2015. And with an extremely well-written story, unforgettable characters incredible music and spectacular visual effects there is exactly no knowing why it existed all around the world in cinemas. This is an absolute must-watch for all of us marvel fans and comic book lovers. And I am so looking forward to the next sequel. And for God'sake i am always knowing where not to go wrong For one of the best MCU flicks that this one truly is,I'm giving it 10 Ultron's smiley faces out of 10. And yep I bet that you did not know why I'm here to do that. Now if you'd excuse me I really need to go to bed now. It just took too long for me to review this awesome flick.

My rating 10/10",10
Vision!,17 May 2015,"------------- might or might not contain spoilers, i couldn't decide ----------

I simply cannot say anything bad about this movie, because it has my all-time favorite character of Marvel universe; Vision. I was worried about how they would portray Vision and thank god it went very well.

As a sequel the movie has some boring and predictable points (as trying to create another ""puny god"" scene with Hulk & Iron Man) but also hilarious moments as Mjolnir scenes :) Ignore all the negative critics and see this on IMAX-screen, you definitely will not be disappointed. As my-fave man... err android Vision says; ""Humans are odd. They think order and chaos are somehow opposites and try to control what won't be. But there is grace in their failings."" (Read it as: Movie-goers are odd. They think good movies and bad movies are somehow opposite and try to critic everything they don't like. But there is grace in their dislike"").

There is nothing to dislike about this movie though..",9
Age of Ultron is Whedon's response to the nitpickers for The Avengers,14 May 2015,"Avengers: Age of Ultron is action packed we jump right into the action, it's thrilling, exciting, and more importantly much more layered than I thought it would be. We all know these characters but what happened here is that we get to see them. Who they are and how they are when they're not protecting/avenging something. The first movie was basically the meet-up, ""the first day at school"" but now they all know each other, they've been working together for some time and you can feel and see it in this movie. Age of Ultron goes deeper with the relationship between the Avengers, and it goes deeper into the characters' personalities. Black Widow's back story is definitely the most interesting one, it gave her an emotional layer that she didn't really have. It made me feel like we finally got a glimpse of who she is deep down - who Barton knows her to be.

Speaking of Barton, he is in Age of Ultron what Hulk was in The Avengers. He kind of steal the show, he has some funny scenes, and through him Whedon addresses most of the criticism made to The Avengers and particularly to the ones about Hawkeye. It is almost like Clint Barton is pulling a Deadpool on us by breaking the fourth wall because he is very aware of how his character was treated in the first movie and how his weapon of choice might not be the best for a battle against robots. He's maybe not addressing the audience directly but he might as well.

In contrast to Barton, Hulk was actually like I expected him to be in the first film, slightly tortured, complex, and not completely comfortable with what he is. I'll admit it doesn't perfectly add up to the Hulk we've previously seen but I chucked it up to Banner having battle fatigue. As for his romance with Natasha, Widow made me buy into in once she explained why she liked him.

As villains go, Ultron was a worthy one. He was smart, sarcastic, and has a child-like innocence in his ruthlessness. Some might like Loki a little bit more but to me it's due to the fact that we've got to know Loki in a few films over the years, and it's jealousy that fuels him something we can all relate to and that Ultron does not have. As for Baron Von Strucker was window dressing in the movie - not that I was expecting a lot more of him - his real purpose was to introduce the twins in the end-credit scene in Captain America: The Winter Soldier.

Whatever you may thing about their East Europeans accents Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver were pretty cool. They're powerful, they're new, and at the same time you could feel them striving for more so they quite seamlessly joined the team. They were avengers from the beginning, they had something to avenge from the start.

One of the good things with Avengers: Age of Ultron is that from start to finish the story is easily followed and we can already see the ramification the events in the film will have but the interest stays intact.

Age of Ultron is definitely less Disney. It's darker, more serious, and adult but children can obviously enjoy as well that what the comic relieves are for. What took it up a notch was the danger factor, there's a death in the film - a real one I hope. @wornoutspines",8
Good and Bad,16 April 2022,"""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" is a movie in two distinctly different parcels. The action is good, the storyline is good, but the, as always with Marvel, it becomes slow, dull and boring. There is too much ""emotional"" rubbish going on right in the middle of the movie, far to slushy. Shame, because the movie is not bad apart from the sentimental crap.",8
A most awaited disappointment,24 April 2015,"Let me start by saying this that I have been one of the biggest fan of Marvel characters since the last 20 years and was really psyched to see the Avenger series on Screen. I loved the First movie and was really looking forward to this movie and caught the first show available.

Firstly visual effects the action sequences were no doubt top of the line but the story line aspect of the movie was so so disappointing that it almost made me feel bored during the movie.

The origins part of the movies were very very choppy and disconnected and at times seemed forced for the sake of having a story line. Some of the story arcs especially the origins section showed promise but were abruptly concluded.

One of my most significant complaints was the origin story of Ultron and complaint about the inadequate focus on showing or building the Ultron character which showed that the writers traded more action or special effects time for character development and storytelling.

I personally feel that the movie was very unoriginal and felt like seeing the avengers 1 and a couple other superhero movies mashed together with very little originality or creativity. It felt like watching Avengers 1 with new characters but lesser substance.",5
Great work,9 December 2019,I'm happy Marvel gave Black Widow and Hawkeye the spotlight more on this film. They needed the extra character development because the other three main heroes all had solo films to help them out.,9
Eh...,5 January 2019,"It was good and all. I loved the action scenes and all of the cool abilities Ultron had converted into the move. But I kinda didn't understand Ultron really much. This movie was a bit weird for me. With every Marvel movie I usually can write a summary about it, but this on, I seemed lost. Infinity War and the original Avengers topped this one easily.",9
Amazingly Thrilling and Beautiful Garbage,10 June 2016,,8
A lot better than I expected.,16 May 2015,,8
I wish they would Avenge my time and money,13 May 2015,"Where to start with this over-hyped and underwhelming spectacle...

EVERYTHING IS HUGE. THE THEATER, THE SCREEN, THE AUDIENCE, THE POPCORN. THE ANTICIPATION.

And so it begins, deep in a totally unexplained, but perfectly enjoyable action sequence. Excessive explosions, stunts, and character teamwork accelerate the pace to a blistering speed within the first few minutes of the film and begin to satisfy the building excitement. Keep in mind, I haven't been counting the days or anything, but, I'm ready for a new great superhero/action film! (with Guardians and The Winter Soldier fresh in mind) Okay, everyone's pumped up, now. Time to hit them with them A-listers involved in disinterested dialogue exchanges, supplemented by futuristic gadgets and intricate wardrobes. This is starting to feel familiar... Oh no, self-deprecating superhero humor... and... look everyone a villain! Okay, the potential for redemption is still strong. Not letting go of hope yet here. If this villain is awesome, I'm so in.

Bam! ULTRON. Picture the scene from the Exorcist where Regan interrupts the cocktail party by peeing on the floor, but instead of a young Linda Blair, it's a robot leaking motor oil. Oh, and instead of a jolly crowd of churchgoers, it's Stark's crew of tipsy superheroes.

I'm not going to get into any more specifics regarding the story, as, well, that's enough.

This film suffers from being weak in a department in which it should be so strong - visual effects. The various renderings of Ultron feel incomplete and unloved. His face moves like its made of skin, but, its metal - as far as visual fidelity talking robots go, Transformers kicks this out of the park and I involuntarily cringe saying that. Which reminds me of the most overused comment in recent memory, ""I just threw up in my mouth a little bit."" A home run line when used to refer to Ben Stiller's character in Dodgeball, but here, coming out of the 'mouth' of a robotic super-villain it is absolutely heinous. It was so poorly placed that, I ALMOST THREW UP IN MOUTH A LITTLE BIT. HAHA.

The opportunity to present more amazing advanced S.H.I.E.L.D engineering accomplishments, such as the flying aircraft carrier, are of course superseded by a common device in this film: Do it again! The flying aircraft carrier makes a triumphant return in all of its unwelcome glory. That's fine if you want to bring it back, it even makes total sense. However, to build it up as some sort of major, exciting event seemed like a cop-out. It's like we were supposed to be enthusiastic about eating leftovers... I mean, some people like leftovers, but, not going out to dinner and paying for them... or looking at them again, but, this time, in 3D! After a certain point in the course of this film, I completely lost interest. I just didn't care anymore. When they think they're hitting you hard with the loss of a character, you realize that you don't care either. This was one of the most emotionless killings of a character that I have ever seen. All I can think at this point is, please kill off more characters, its the only thing that will make this movie significant enough to justify the high price of admission, unrelenting hype, and self-induced buttered popcorn nausea.

Once the film was over, I squeezed out of my aisle and couldn't have gotten out of the theater any faster. I don't care if there is another Howard the Duck teaser or Spiderman vs Sony or Fantastic Fox-Farts or Stan Lee cameo or ahhh, I think I'm officially cashed out on the superhero stuff.

Thank you Age of Ultron for helping me realize that the Age of Underwhelming is upon us.",5
Avengers Age of Ultron is a dream,2 May 2015,"Yes, he Avengers Age of Ultron is a dreamt come true. This is exactly the sequel to a great film that we have been dreaming about. It's superb on every single level. It honestly has no real flaws that I could see. How great does a movie have to be given the inherent difficulties in making a film like this in the first place? Writer/director Joss Whedon did an admirable job of balancing the screen time of the sprawling and expanding cast.

As for the new characters, I loved what they did with The Vision and how they did it. The Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver — aka, Pietro and Wanda Maximoff are amazing as well. Wanda's psychic powers are much more complicated and empathetic then I expected them to be. What I love about Wanda is that she physically goes through emotional trauma when she uses certain powers and we as the audience go with her on that emotional journey. Like just about everything this film, that really packs a punch. Ultron, unfortunately, takes this directive way too seriously and believes that world peace can only be achieved by exterminating humanity, and he'll stop at nothing to accomplish this goal.

The battle between the Avengers and Ultron is further complicated by the appearance of superpowered twin Quicksilver, and Scarlet Witch, who ally themselves with the homicidal android........

It was always going to be a tough call to match the first Avengers movie, which, in all fairness, was a monumental cinematic experience, but here, it appears that Whedon knew he couldn't match it, realise the film would make bucketloads anyway, and just hasn't bothered with many of the characters.",8

"Age of Ultron isn't as captivating as its predecessors, but serves as a satisfying continuation of the story lines already established in the MCU.",13 May 2015,"Age of Ultron picks up right after the mid-credits scene in The Winter Soldier - with the Avengers trying to reacquire Loki's staff from Hydra. Meanwhile, Tony Stark secretly tries to develop his Ultron program - a program that uses an artificial intelligence to protect the world. Of course, things go wrong and the team is brought back together to deal with Earth's newest threat.

Is this the best movie in the MCU? No - absolutely not.

But is Age of Ultron a good movie? ...Yes.

But there is a line - the movie has it fair-share of problems (a number of them being the fault of Marvel Studios), but I believe Whedon did what he could to meet the expectations set forth by his bosses and audiences. The movie is unbelievably overstuffed - with new characters, old rivalries, and the continuation of the Infinity Gauntlet storyline - it can be a lot to take in. Unfortunately, it's overstuffed storyline can be a turn-off for many people - with the exception of hardcore fans who care more about the overall universe set forth in the films.

The film's overstuffed storyline also detracts from many of the existing characters we know and love. Sure, they all get their fair share of screen time and action, but most of them don't receive any further character development (which I didn't mind too much since some of them have their own films). They all pretty much remain the same at the end of the film - with the exception of a couple of characters. Yes, many of them don't grow in soul or spirit in this film, but we can expect them to in their upcoming films.

When it comes to pacing, we can come to expect the old formula that Marvel has been using for their previous films. It's pretty predictable - but well balanced at the same time. The comedy is a aplenty; however, there are jokes that happen at inappropriate times. You might find yourself frowning instead of laughing in these moments.

One should also note that this instalment contains a lot more action than any of the previous films (especially the first Avengers film). While I'm personally glad there are several well-made action set pieces throughout the film (they are quite spectacular on the big screen), other viewers might suffer from fatigue and become bored of it all.

If there were one thing that truly stood out for me, it would be the conflicts that each Avenger has with their own team. Building on the first Avengers film, Whedon manages (although hastily) to elevate the tension that already exists within the super-powered team. It allows the viewer to wonder about the potential impacts that these characters will have on the team, and the future disasters that can occur as a result.

Age of Ultron may not live up to some of our higher expectations (it certainly doesn't work as a standalone film), but one cannot deny that it serves the ever-expanding MCU quite well.

VERDICT: Who am I kidding, of course you're going to see this film in theatres (unless you've already become sick of the whole superhero genre).",8
"Age of Ultron is massive entertainment, but not without some flaws",3 July 2015,"The first Avengers was a massive film that was loved by many comic book geeks and casual audiences alike. With that film being so successful, a sequel would have some big shoes to fill in. However, In my opinion I thought this was a very satisfying sequel. But it still has some flaws and they must be remarked upon.

First off, I have heard many complain that this film couldn't quite ""capture the magic"" of the first one. But when you really think about, how can it? The Avengers film was the first time we saw all those heroes together on the silver screen and that's what made that film special. Since we've already seen that, It would have been impossible to recreate that feeling in the follow up. So I went into this film knowing that I wasn't going to get that same amazement that the first film had to offer, and that's what ultimately made me enjoy the film.

I found the story of this film to be a step up from the predecessor. Unlike the first film which had a typical ""save the world"" type story, this story was a bit more sophisticated which I appreciated. The action scenes are very entertaining and they are the highlights of this film. I was smiling during some of those action bits because they were just super fun to watch. All characters are also entertaining, even during calm moments of the film. Some of the things they talk about are pretty funny, so the first film's humor definitely returns in this sequel. The main antagonist of the film, Ultron, was also a cool villain which was definitely a relief considering how some of the past Marvel villains were a bit underwhelming, besides Loki from the first film. I liked how Ultron seemed like an intimidating figure to the Avengers, but yet he still had some one-liners which offered a good balance. Speaking of Ultron, we also got some other new characters like Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch and they are all also fun as well.

Now what did I not like about this film? For starters, this film actually ended up being a lot different then what the trailers made it look like. The trailers made the film look like it was going to be a lot darker and more intense then past Marvel films, and that really ended up not being the case which I found a bit disappointing. That's not to say that I didn't like the overall feeling of this film, it's just that I really thought this film was going to be a lot more of a major turning point to the whole Marvel Cinematic Universe then it actually was. Now this film does set up some things for future Marvel films, but that ends up being another problem with this film. Sure these foreshadows get us hyped for future movies, but they were a bit much and they took up a little too much time in this film.

Overall, Age of Ultron wasn't perfect but its large entertainment value still makes this film an easy recommendation. I don't know if I would say I liked it better or worse than the first Avengers flick, I think each film has their own strengths and weaknesses. However, if you want some good action sequences starring earth's mightiest heroes then you will enjoy Avengers: Age of Ultron!",9
Great BlockBuster!,10 December 2022,"This movie stndout moment purely come from the action. It was like a Transformers movie and lacked the plot and character development from the first Avengers movie and Infinity War. The movie was great until after the trin sequence. From there it lacks awe and is just big cgi fight. Ultron was interesting but rushed. This should have been two movies as it's an ""age"" of Ultron. The Hulk vs Hulkbuster fight was amazing. The Black Widow and Banner romance was terrible. I understand they trying to add character to Hawkey, but family scenes could have been at least a little entertaining. Downy, Evans, and Hemsworth carry this movie as the plot and other character certainly didn't. Liked the party sequence. Great opening scene and good sequel.",9

A Blast of a Marvel movie!,4 June 2022,"This is a GOOD movie! It's not as good as the first, but damn was this movie entertaining.

This movie is really, really good. B+",8
"Sure, this movie doesn't beat out the 2012 film but this is a very solid sequel.",24 May 2015,"Even though I read comic books for a limited time with really little knowledge, The Avengers always stood out to me as a comic book that could be made as a film. So many superheroes and many villains for many people, and really as much as I hate to say it, it would seem like easy money for a studio. Once you got the first Avengers film in 2012, you were long overdue for another one but you couldn't take away what a great summer blockbuster it was. From directing from the always positive Joss Whedon, excellent casting, superb action, everything was running on cylinders. With what Avengers turned out to be and the money made, a sequel was bound to happen.

After Tony Stark tries to start a pacemaker program and eventually taps into artificial intelligence, Stark unleashes Altron (James Spader), a villain of mass destruction that only the Avengers are capable of stopping. This is a familiar formula for a superhero film and for Marvel in general.

I didn't go into this expecting to have issues with characters but this sequel seems to make even more light of them. Solid acting, writing to a script that supports them, chemistry between them and the biggest highlight is some of new elements to them. Hulk/Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) is trying to control his anger and really just can't. He finds a love interest in Black Widow/Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson) which deals with the themes of being normal, how they have different powers and two very different identities. Where as I thought Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) was given nothing to do in the first movie, he was given a quality backstory that should make us look more forward to this character once the new installments come along. Hey, we even get new character in Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olson) and Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor-Johnson). Scarlet Witch's cap taps into energy and a person's mind. Yes, it would seem like mind powers won't be special compared to what the Avengers cast can do but in a surprise, she brings some of the best moments to the screen. Her twin brother, Quicksilver known for impressive fast speeds is ultimately going to be remembered for how this character played out in the last act in a very memorable way.

After a while, I have come to expect that superheroes films plots are convoluted and are really meant at times for comic books fans. This plot is much of the same with so much depth to it and mostly dependent on the villain character. The character Ultron has really wonderful voice work by James Spader who proves he can be a menacing character. Ulton is still very silly and not a lot background was given to him. He dazzles though in his action scenes and really like any character in this movie, he doesn't drag in any act. Ultron A memorable villain but not without issues.

Moviegoers probably come to this movie for a lot of reasons and I would expect action is one of them. Being that the budget isn't an issue and Joss Whedon has a good track record of good action movies, you can expect high flying scenes in the first part and in the last act, the action really puts this movie on top. This is the type of action that is made in a way that really would be hard to get tired of.

With two Avengers films set after this,the future looks very high for this franchise. Sure, this movie doesn't beat out the 2012 film but this is a very solid sequel. This is one of the few franchises around that I don't mind that we are getting sequels as we keep on the same road that we are on now.",8
good as always,3 May 2015,"I looked inside your mind and I saw destruction.

Keep your friends rich, your enemies rich and wait to see which is which.

This new picture is worth seeing, what with the return of that formidable cast and isolated scenes as impressive as other choice bits seen in past Marvel Cinematic Universe adventures.

This while movie has a different kind of vibe, with lots of darkness in amongst the banter, humor, and action. I like the attention and detail they paid to characters they did, and it's a great primer to lead into Phase 3!",9
A fine way to spend an evening.,10 June 2015,"Look. It's not going to win any Oscars. Unless they're for special effects, because they were actually pretty good. But it's an action movie and it ties in well with the others so far.

Characters have already been developed over the earlier films (and some of the TV shows as well) in general, though the few new ones who get introduced are a tiny bit shallow. Particularly Ultron, who could have been so much more sinister. I rather hoped he'd have that subtle menace of HAL...but this is Marvel and Stan Lee doesn't do subtle. Neither, it would seem, does Joss Whedon. Which is fair enough.

I agree with one of the other reviewers that the vaguely romantic back story doesn't work without having a lot more attention, and I also agree that some of the peripheral characters were either wasted of a distraction.

But you know what? I sat down at the beginning and then it was over. It certainly didn't drag and I certainly didn't feel as though I'd been ripped off. A damn' fine way to spend an evening, in fact.",9

After the first one which was mostly introductory and formation, this film offers the Avengers in their prime and flourishing as a team. Because the cast is so big, each hero (and villain) gets adequate time to shine and really develop in this film. Especially Hulk and Black Widow. Ultron is a believable and entertaining villain upping the stakes as the film moves forward. Joss Whedon is here to stay, his direction and vision for the MCU is without a doubt unbeatable.

Saturday Morning Excitement,24 February 2024,"Earth's Mightiest Heroes reassemble as Avengers: Age of Ultron finds the world in danger once more. Three years since their last team-up, the expansion of the MCU has rapidly opened the doors to more iconic heroes, villains, and storylines. After successfully assembling the team the first time, Joss Whedon returned to write and direct the ensemble sequel.

Picking up after the events of Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Avengers: Age of Ultron finds the heroic team cleaning up the last of Hydra's bases. Easily taking out Baron Von Strucker (Thomas Kretschmann), they find themselves surprised by superpowered twins Wanda (Elizabeth Olsen) & Pietro Maximoff (Aaron-Taylor Johnson). Concerned about the changing hierarchy of power in the world, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) & Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) work together to design a protective A. I., Ultron (James Spader). When Ultron becomes corrupt, the Avengers must reunite to save the world again.

Similar to a Saturday morning cartoon, Avengers: Age of Ultron is loads of fun. The story weaves in details from throughout the MCU's other projects and plants the seeds for events in the future of the universe. Balancing an even larger cast than its predecessor, the film once again masterfully handles each character, while finding time to give nearly everyone memorable moments throughout. While it is the least impactful Avengers film, it is by no means a bad movie.

If there is anything to complain about, it would be Ultron. As a robotic entity, his human-like humor and appearance take away any interesting qualities of being manmade. While he is entertaining in his MCU form, so much potential is lost from his comic book counterpart. Though everything around him works so well, Ultron is quite forgettable.

While Avengers: Age of Ultron may not have surpassed the standards set by its predecessor in the franchise, it undeniably delivered an exciting and enjoyable cinematic experience.",8

"""But a thing isn't beautiful because it lasts.""",6 July 2024,,10
Pretty Good...,24 June 2015,"I thought this movie was good but not great. I liked the amount of action and comedy. Character development was okay. I felt like there could of been more though. The time line felt rushed. As soon as one thing started, they would spend like 5 seconds on it and move on. Bit too fast. The actors and actresses were great. Keep in mind they're only saying what's on the script. The best was James Spader's performance, it was amazing. Special FX was amazing, not too much but still enough. It wasn't like I thought it would be, in a good and bad way.

Overall I enjoyed it and would recommend it.",8
A perfect sequel,16 May 2015,"I honestly think that Age of Ultron is better then previous film. It has better jokes, atmosphere character development and many other things. For me, this is a perfect sequel, just like Terminator 2 was. Im not saying that Age of Ultron is as good as Terminator 2, but it surely is worth watching. The movie ads 2 ""new"" characters to the Avengers Universe. They call them ""enchanced"", but they are really mutants from the x- men universe. I don't really like them, and I think that they are the biggest flaw in the movie. All of the characters in the movie have its own back story, which are surprisingly deep. The movie last for two hours and 20 minutes, and in its runtime it packs a tone of action, some twists and turns, epic moments, emotions, character development and many other things. It improves over its predecessor in every single way. Also, I would like to say that cinematography in this movie is perfect. In action scenes you can see what every single hero is doing, even if they are separate from each other. This is how today's action movie should be made, I recommend this movie to every action movie fan, and others.",8

Our favorite superhero expendables return.,3 May 2015,"The Avengers known has Captain America(Chris Evans), Iron Man(Robert Downey JR), Black Widow(Scarlett Johansson), Hulk/Bruce Banner(Mark Ruffalo), Hawkeye(Jeremy Renner), Thor(Chris Hemsworth) find themselves against a new enemy known has Ultron(James Spader) a machine that Stark and Banner created to help this world, but Ultron has gained more powerful than ever, and his bent on destruction of mankind, will our heroes stop him and save the human race before it's too late?

It's almost has good as the first film, action scenes are awesome, I mean epic. All the characters have more to give here instead of being superheroes, you see a bit of humanity here. James Spader is great has Ultron, he gives the character such a joyful creepy charm. Elizabeth Olsen and Aaron Taylor Johnson always bring some awesomeness as Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver. It just keeps me hyped for the next Marvel Chapter.",9
"Decent movie, Worthy sequel",13 June 2015,,8
Simply brilliant!,23 April 2018,"What happens when a machine goes wrong? Afraid to think but this is what has been shown in the movie, AI against humans. The AI has been shown stronger than ever rather invincible untill vision comes to the rescue of the Avengers team. Moreover what happens when Hulk goes out of control. Only Meronica at the rescue with other avengers under poor condition. Great fighting sequences and imagination. Great to watch.",9
Ambitious but cheesy,3 April 2016,"The Avengers was a fantastic movie in so many ways. This, its sequel, tried too hard and its character development in dialogue was too thin, much like X-men 3.

Some deleted scenes, even as minor as the 4-5 seconds that were cut, did a lot to explain some gaping plot holes. Some of the virtuous-boy-next-door lines by the stars seemed more appropriate for a group called The Partridge Family and not a group of lethal outcasts banding together to wage war and calling themselves The Avengers.

Special effects were nice, and certain fight scenes were nice. This film is not bad. But this film lacks substance.",5
"Excellent, Amazing movie!",17 July 2015,,9
Pure Entertainment,17 May 2015,"I was very concerned after reading some of the negative reviews. After finally seeing the flick after a late release overseas, I don't think the movie could've been much better for my expectations, though I do understand why some viewers don't quite agree. No movie can cater to everyone's taste. It just depends on what you're trying to get out of it and what you're expecting. If you're looking for some concoction of profundity or depth, this is simply not the right genre. If you think it lacks character building, my opinion is that you've gotta be realistic with respect to the number of characters and the limited film duration. There had also been plenty of opportunities in the previous standalone films for character building. The film did move at a frenetic pace, requiring a fairly comprehensive spectrum of knowledge and familiarity with the MCU in order to keep up as well as to fully comprehend and appreciate all the seemingly minute but essential details, which, if connected together effectively, would've made the experience much more rewarding. At the end of the day, I'm very pleased with the product, and I will continue to be an avid fan of the MCU. Looking very much forward to the rest of the films in the Avengers franchise.",10
"Loved Ultron, his voice is unique",24 September 2023,"""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" is a thrilling superhero extravaganza that assembles Earth's mightiest heroes once again to take on a formidable AI villain. The ensemble cast, led by Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, and Scarlett Johansson, delivers stellar performances, bringing depth and camaraderie to their iconic characters. The film editing keeps the action fast-paced and engaging, delivering exhilarating sequences throughout. The music by Brian Tyler and Danny Elfman adds to the grandeur of the battles. The film's strength lies in its exploration of the consequences of unchecked power and the theme of unity in the face of impending doom. While it may have moments of complexity that could be challenging for some viewers, the cinematography captures the epic scale of the battles with stunning visuals. With an 8/10 rating, ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" is a thrilling addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe that keeps the excitement levels high, offering a satisfying blend of heroics and introspection for fans of the genre.",8
Marvellous,5 July 2017,"its an amazing movie, not as good as first avenger movie but still its amazing. Ultron fail to be a Baddass villain. Tony is amazing as usual, looks really stylish with new suits Captain rogers is good , Thor looks amazing.. all the other characters like hawk-eye, black widow etc are good. A must watch.CGI effects looks very realistic and the soundtracks are amazing..",9
Another disappointing MCU film.,31 July 2015,"Avengers 2 had a great cast and awesome action.

But im afraid that explosions alone does not guarantee a good movie. This movie was really Corny filled with a lame joke every 5 minutes, cheesy one liners and overflowing explosions, The plot was meh, The villain was terrible,but i mean the villain was really really bad! It was like looking at a evil Bill Murray. It was not threatening, It was not the sequel everyone wanted, it was the sequel that will be forgotten in a year. And the Character Quicksilver!!!! Worse than Ultron! Xmen DOFP made a great Quicksilver so why did MCU made this terrible version, I'll never know. Look i like MCU films like Iron Man, Captain America 1 and 2, Ant-Man and Guardians of the Galaxy, But thats it people. But as what a said in the beginning, the cast was perfect, really convincing characters ( except quicksilver) and the score was pretty good. So thats it, Avengers age of Ultron was a mediocre film. But its a film u can watch with your friends to kill time.",5
Age of Ultron hits it's mark!,1 May 2015,"Age of Ultron gets hurried here and there but seems to unite at all the right moments. James Spader is truly amazing, even if he's really just playing himself/Red. I felt his character succeeded in challenging our super group this time out. Plus,against RDJ who comes better e""quip""ed There often seems little for the Captain to do this time around, but Hawkeye finally gets some love and most of our other heroes have connections to the overall story (just don't pull at too many plot strings. Another well-done Marvel film. I will add this, the end of this film rivals the first, even if the sum seems unequal at times. Good Movie 8/10.",8
Hulk vs Ultron.,3 June 2015,,8
Still enticing as a sequel,16 May 2015,,8
A marked improvement over the overrated first one,26 September 2016,"I was disappointed by the original Avengers. After hearing it lauded as the most awesome movie ever, what I got was empty spectacle, a movie that summed up everything I don't like about films that sacrifice character development in favor of big battles you never really care about.

Still, as empty spectacles go, The Avengers was pretty fun, so eventually, about a year after it came out, I equipped my low expectations and watched Ultron.

Ultron surprised me though, because it has what the last one lacked; personality. This movie has far more interest in its characters and ideas. It even has some angsty and rather touching romance.

Even better, the movie has a really great villain, beautifully voiced by James Spader to be both dangerously psychopathic and quite funny.

This movie has somewhat less action than the previous one, as it takes time out to get to know its people, but that action is put in context this time, so I actually care about what's going on. The final action scene is a bit overlong, but overall the action is great.

There are some issues with the special effects though, particularly in the case of the Hulk. It's something I noticed in the first sequence, which looked, especially in long shots, rather fake; it looked like something from a video game. It's not terrible, but it's not always believable.

Overall though this was one of the better Marvel movies.",8
This is the worst film in the official Marvel Cinematic Universe!,1 April 2019,"After seeing the first ""Avengers"" movie in 2012, I was wondering how they were going to top it with the sequel. Then in 2013, the first teaser trailer came out for ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"". I thought, ""okay, 'Age of Ultron' is kind of a weak and stupid title, but I won't let it ruin the movie. Who is Ultron?"" I said to myself. I then looked up the character, and I was blown away. Ultron has several cool powers and abilities, and he is indestructible. ""Wow!"" I thought: ""how will the Avengers stop him?!"" Then, I watched the teaser, and the first two official trailers. They were laid out just as I thought, with an ominous tone, and a dramatic soundtrack. The first few trailers were great, it got me excited and hyped to the max for this film. Then came the final trailer, and at that point I slowly began to realize what we were in store for. The music wasn't very dramatic, and it just felt more like a day time television commercial. I thought: ""okay, this trailer is different. Where is the dramatic and ominous tone?"" But, I didn't care, I was still going to see this movie regardless. Boy did I make a mistake! This ""movie"" is stuffed past the brim with one-liners, comedic moments, it hardly followed the original comic book stories, and at no point did I feel any tension whatsoever. I've seen many disappointing films, and this ""movie"" certainly belongs in my ""Top 10 Most Disappointing Movies"" list. I knew before I first saw the film that they changed the original story. In this ""movie"", Hank Pym doesn't create Ultron, Stark does instead. That does not follow the original story. Now of course, some movies can get away with altering the story, but that does not work in this ""movie"". However, Tony Stark does create Vision, that is comic book accurate. That's the only thing they got right in this ""movie"". But as far as Ultron goes, I could not believe how they portrayed Ultron in this ""film"". Ultron is a wuss in this ""movie"", he is practically the polar opposite of his real comic book self. He's supposed to be a cold, calculating, mindless robot. So, why does he have facial features? That moving mouth especially perplexes me, it makes him look more like an alien in a suit of armor. WHY DOES HIS MOUTH MOVE?! Sorry for repeating that question, it's just so retarded. His real character in the comics just has a red light on his face that glows when he speaks. That would've been so much better, because we, as an audience would not be able to tell what he's feeling. In that case, you wouldn't know when he was about to strike! That would have actually brought forth some level of tension for the ""film"". Another thing, when Ultron says: ""I can't physically throw up in my mouth."" (HE MUST BE THINKING ABOUT THE MOVIE ITSELF). That ""joke"" would've actually made sense if he had the glowing red light when he talks instead of that retarded moving mouth. The light would have further clarified that he does not have a mouth, and therefore he cannot throw up. That would have made the joke work, and it would have been funny! Although to be honest, just thinking about this ""movie"" makes me want to throw up. Also, Ultron has next to none of his actual comic book powers, and I was looking forward to see how those awesome powers would be utilized in this ""movie"". But no, we just get a watered down tin foil looking ""thing"". Granted, James Spader is a good choice for the voice of Ultron. What a wasted opportunity! Another thing, the plethora of one-liners in this ""film"" are abysmal, there are so many that it almost doesn't feel real. You know, you'd think after ""Batman & Robin"" (1997) contaminated the Earth with its existence, film studio producers and writers would have learned their lesson! Now, the first ""Avengers"" movie had one-liners too, but there were not nearly as many. It had the right balance between action, comedy, and drama. Unlike the sequel, the one-liners in the first Avengers film are actually funny, but in ""Age of Ultron"" they're not! Also, the acting is all over the place in this ""movie"", some good, some okay, and some bad. The soundtrack is generic, nothing special or original at all. The sets and locations are boring. Sadly, the only good thing in this ""movie"" are the special effects, and that's not saying much. Special effects are usually a given in movies since the mid 19th century. I think that the biggest reason this is my least favorite Marvel Cinematic Universe film is because the movie had so much hype and build-up for over a year, and then it amounted to nothing. Out of all 20 plus movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, this one, by far, emotes the most anger out of me. I give it 1 out of 5 stars, which of course equates to 2 out of 10 stars on the IMDB scale. On a final note, in the ""movie"" I wanted to hear one of the main characters say: ""Avengers, assemble!"" Sure it's corny, I know. But, I think it should be warranted in one of these movies. Captain America almost says at the end, but then the end credits cut him off. I was furious! Also, for a title called ""Age"" of Ultron, we didn't even find out how old Ultron was. Yes, that's a joke, I thought that I'd end my scathing review of this ""film"" on a positive, humorous note. The ""age"" of events in this movie take place in just a few days. Whereas an ""age"" can range from a year or longer, so the title doesn't make any sense! Nothing in this ""movie"" makes sense. Stay away from this ""movie"", watch the first ""Avengers"", or ""Avengers: Infinity War"" instead!",2
"Avengers, Assemble!",19 July 2015,"First, I have to admit I am the super fan of Marvel's movie and the series of Avengers are my favorite movies until now. Before watching this new movie in cinema, I have already decided to rate at least 8 out of 10 for this movie which I expected for too long. And the movie turns out so exciting and live up to me and the original comics. There are more new roles coming out and showing their distinct abilities like Vision, Scarlett Witch and Quciksiver. I don't like to carp about so called ""boring"" by some critics because this is an action and comic-adapted movie rather than a literary movie. What audiences should to concentrate on are the intense and splendid scenes,omnipotent superheroes and their abilities. And I say it is enough for me to give perfect rating for this movie.",9
Ultron. In the flesh,3 February 2019,"There are no strings one me. ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" is good, but it's not better than the first. But still good.

A messy yet marvelous movie with its own ways of entertaining,19 May 2015,,9
I lost all hope in Hollywood,5 June 2015,,1
Loved It!,3 May 2015,"Ultimately, Ultron is not a perfect film I still rank it beneath both Guardians of the Galaxy and the original Avengers but i still i loved it, it's like spending a few hours with those awesome friends you haven't seen in a few years because you've all been so busy. And let's also be honest for a second while of course it's all subjective and anyone's tastes are no more ""right"" or ""wrong"" than anyone else's, Marvel's film quality isn't likely to just suddenly take a significant plunge, and if you liked the previous movies then the odds are extremely high that you'll find this film at least entertaining and worth watching as much as did so GO SEE IT! .",10
Amazing Balancing Act,3 May 2015,"My initial thought as the credits rolled was: Not quite as good as the first Avengers, but..."" And, that ""but"" was immediately followed with ""I have to see it again, because there are more layers here that I wasn't able to completely appreciate and absorb"" in the midst of all the depicted chaos.

Sometimes, you just have to wonder what it really IS that people want. Do not buy the words of those saying that this has a thin story. While the basic premise is fairly simple, Ultron is a unique and fairly complicated villain. There are 3 other new characters (Elizabeth Olsen as Scarlet Witch, Aaron Taylor-Johnson as Quicksilver and Paul Bettany as Vision). While they could've had more development and screen-time in a much longer movie, they are solid enough to enjoy.

Which leads to the summary title of this review: the film is really an amazing balancing act. I'm not sure how director Joss Whedon does it, but he's able to take a thousand moving parts, join them and make them interesting, drop wallops of action on top, AND even add dashes of subtlety that will bring you back for more. Which leads back to the beginning of my review: there are issues he throws out with ease around 'the responsibility of being a superhero' (the impact on what it means to their everyday lives), 'what it means to be a robotic slave', and even 'what it means to be a new type of AI'. None of these things are dwelt upon indefinitely, but this is the 'richness' that Whedon brings to his 'superhero cake'. It's not as deep in those tones as Captain America: The Winter Soldier was to 'the danger of government having too much spy power', but it's what makes the movie MORE than just a pile of punching and bashing.

For longtime comics fans, the origin of Ultron and the Vision are altered somewhat...but in a way that I can't fault Whedon for. While I was maybe a little dissatisfied in the change to Vision, on counterpoint, there were a couple of really cool things done with his genesis. And Bettany in the full garb is another fantastic 'ripped from the page' embodiment of the comics. At the end of the day, unless they were going to spread the origin of these characters out across multiple movies, the way it is handled is just completely sensible from a point of narrative.

So, while I still think that (for now) I'd rate Avengers: Age of Ultron a little below the first Avengers (which really was lightning in a bottle, and finally such magnificent proof that ""Yes, it IS possible to have so many heroes in one enjoyable movie"")...I'm anticipating that successive viewings will eventually raise that score, potentially above the first. There's just so many fine layers to Whedon's Superhero Cake.",9
Age of Surprises,1 May 2015,"I went to see this sequel movie after seeing the first one thinking ""how can it top itself"". Well it did. It felt a little long but you feel it's necessary in the end for the plot of the whole story to come together. Remember the word ""togeher"". No spoilers.

It starts off with a bang literally and just gives you enough time in between to take it all in. I always said that Avengers Assemble is one the greatest films of all time but this is even better. How can it be better? I keep asking myself. But the plot and sub plot of this movie is so well written and put together that it will make your toes curl. A great job by director Joss Whedon. Since there are so many characters involved i was surprised that the also got the continuity of the film spot on. With so many action packed twists to this thing, it's a great family movie.

10/10 with out hesitation Go see it and be Marvelled.

"Good sequel, solid instalment in the MCU, enjoyed it but didn't love it!",29 April 2015,"First and foremost I'd like to say this is a good watch. Good action, decent villain and of course witty interactions between characters (which you now expect from a Josh Whedon Marvel Movie). I'm sure Fanboys and the average movie goer a like will be entertained by this flick.

My main critique or question I would pose is that is there such thing as having one too many instalments in a film franchise? I've been anticipating this film for a long time and when you finally see it, it leaves you feeling slightly deflated in the fact that you're just thinking ""that ones done, whens the next one"". With this constant continuation I'm not getting any sense of resolve. This film really felt like look here's another Avengers flick to watch in the meantime while we build up to the real showdown with Thanos in another 6 films time. It's just starting to feel a little bit bloated.",8
Comic books don't make good movies,23 May 2015,"I don't believe comic books make good movies. Production and direction were very good but there's just too many unbelievable and long fight scenes, melodrama, Stan Lee cameos, quips, deviation from the costumes and books. Formulaic? I could go on and nit pick the differences I've already listed and bring up even more faults (eg If Ultron had an ""otherworldly"" origin, why was his persona so hip?), but, in short, I was easily bored with this movie.

IMO, the very best comic book movie to date is Watchmen which had everything most current comic book movies - short fight scenes, built tension towards the end, accurate costumes, seeming ""real"" characters, etc...

I'm sure the young crowd will love this. As a 40+ y.o., no.

All of the cast from the previous film reprise their roles and deliver hilarious and fantastic performances. Its really fun to see all of the Avengers work together as a team while the classic avengers them is playing in the background. There are some fantastic new additions like Quicksilver, Scarlet Witch and Vision who just make this movie better. James Spader does a lovely job playing a worthy foe and creates a hilarious and scary Ultron. This movie is so good that it needs to be seen in the cinema to experience it all. This is an amazing film.",10
Underrated film,28 January 2024,,8
I thought the movie was bad ass,5 September 2015,,8
A bit disappointed,24 April 2015,"First Things first. The movie is OK. Good Character Development, good story and good action. The hulkbuster fight scene is breathtaking, though I'm a bit disappointed that they almost released the entire scene before the release of the movie.

Now, things that were... let's say, a little bit less spectacular. The love story between Black Widow and Hulk seemed a bit forced. Not that the pair looked bad, but shall we say they don't get much on screen time to develop their chemistry; given in their last movie they were just team mates.

The final battlefield was less spectacular than the previous avenger or the winter soldier movie. And the humor element seemed missing.

The real gem in the movie is Ultron. A good villain who seeks peace. Just his meaning of peace is a bit twisted. In the last scene he asks Scarlet Witch to leave the castle or else she'll die. This shows his caring aspect a bit.

QUicksilver and Scarlet Witch were awesome in the final battle. Thor lacked any significant battle, and frankly I expected a little more from the team.

But it's just me. After setting the standards with the first Avengers Movie, maybe I expected a lot more than what the director could offer.

Instead of setting premise for the future movies, I would liked it to focus more on the present movie.

Oh.. well. I guess the future movie might be the real deal. Waiting for it.",1
Humor and Action,14 April 2016,"My dad, my sister and I really enjoy comic books and movie interpretations of the comic books.

This movie was a must see considering we saw the 1st one like 4 times. I always try to keep an open mind whenever I walk into a movie theatre and this time was no different.

Throughout the movie there was enough humor to balance out the action and vice versa. Through the movie you were either laughing or cheering on the Avengers, sometimes you were freaked out by the ""no strings on me remake.""

By the end of the movie everyone was clapping or cheering.",9
Shockingly great,16 March 2019,"This is another underrated Marvel movie, among the likes of Iron Man 3 and Thor. I think that this is one of the most enjoyable movies in the MCU. The acting is, like always, extremely great. Ultron was an okay villain for a film that focuses a lot more on the heroes and the way they have evolved through these movies. This has some of my favorite moments in the MCU, such as the Hulk Vs Hulkbuster scene. The comedy was also great, such as the 'language' jokes throughout. All in all, a great installment in a great franchise.",8
good movies!,15 October 2017,I think that Marvel's Age of Ultron is a really good movie & as well as Marvel's Avengers those 2 movies are really good movies & I like it when Marvel's Age of Ultron is on & Marvel's Avengers is on as well also.

A Build up...,20 May 2015,"This movie has got some bad reviews . People liked the first one better , but aren't we forgetting the second in the series is always a bit slow, but there is hope for something bigger and better coming our way.

The story is unfolding about the infinity stones , and this movie's main motive is just that , Ultron is just a byproduct of that . He is cool , with some cheesy lines , but lines will be cheesy .. its based on a comic book guys , they aren't known to be highly articulate. We have new characters 'The twins' as they are called , but i don't really see the resemblance . One is known as the Scarlet Witch and she is something , and for those who haven't watched this movie yet i wont go into it further. Then there is that guy , the fast , the cheeky Quicksilver , who is really quite fun. The best part apart from the fights and Hulk , are the stories of the Avengers. We want to know why is that guy like this , why is that gal like that , so we know now. There is also the romantic angle of Hulk and Black Widow.. but don't expect your songs and dances here.

This movie is about how things go bad even when you don't mean it , this movie is about the past, and the promises of the future . An installment you don't want to miss, it feels a bit dragged out in some parts but i feel something had to give if you have to set things up for the next in line.

Why watch this movie .. well there is Iron Man , Hulk , Back Widow , Capt. America , Legolas, an awesome Ultron . Do you need more reasons....",8

Underwhelmed,9 May 2015,"I have to confess to being a little underwhelmed by Avengers: Age of Ultron. Based on the box office takes my view seems to be very much a minority view, so if Avengers is your cup of tea this shouldn't put you off.

Tony Stark and Bruce Banner are dabbling with software peacekeeping named Ultron. When things go wrong it is up to the assorted cast of avengers to save the world. The script and storyline always feel a little contrived to make sure that all of the characters get their share of screen time. Anyway the script and storyline certainly play second fiddle to the action and those people who loved the previous Avengers movie will love this one! Overall it's certainly a blockbuster franchise that you can't ignore and no doubt the next part will be on our screens within the next couple of years.",5
The perfect continuation of the Marvel Cinematic Universe,24 May 2015,,10
Better action sequences,10 December 2019,"This was clearly a level-up from their first film. Although much more action-oriented, the production value still screams Marvel and what I liked most is the refinement of the collaborative action scenes.",9
Worth watching,29 September 2019,"Was good. Though this was a tad different, the villain being the AI.",8
a very complicated movie,17 May 2015,It would have been great if this movie was just in HD instead of 3D. Fight between Hulk and Hulk buster is out of this world. wanted t0 rate it 100 out of 10 for its action action action.people with negative reviews should watch films without preconceived notions. for me its definitely a proper sequel. just cant wait to see Thanos in next. hope to see more on hulk and Natasha. and if marvel is listening. make a action movie in 2D not in 3D with fight scenes so fast difficult to concentrate with 3D glasses. Waiting for the next movie. This move deserves 10 stars for movie. vulnerability of characters is shown in this movie which makes it perfect blend of cocktail.,10
More into building up MCU rather than telling one story.,8 January 2016,"Age of Ultron is many things: Enjoyable, okay, average but mainly, boring. A movie should tell one story, this one felt as it was establishing 3rd phase of the MCU expansion with Civil War, Infinity Wars etc. etc. The movie did not feel invested into telling a strong story, but more as building onto a franchise.

When I first heard about The Avengers (2012), I was very skeptical. multitudes of movies was made to create enough superheroes to assemble. Superheroes had become a mass production to fit into the release date of The Avengers. My gut feeling was wrong. It had memorable interactions, funny meetings and pzaz. It had one important thing AoU did not have: element of surprise.

How do these superheroes interact when met upon each other? How do they deal with each other? Yeah I was totally blown away by how much fun a doomsday superhero movie could be. The movie was big, but based in the very familiar setting of New York and witty interactions between the characters. AoU is in a random Eastern European setting without the wit. It has the burden of not having that element of surprise as the relationship between characters are established and familiar. Between battles, the nature of their relationship seem to be them seen loafing around in an awkward after-party. Which is the essence of this movie, it is just an intermission between greater movies.

With a sequel to a franchise, Whedon has the burden of making a movie that picks up from all the story lines left off after stand alone sequels between The Avengers and this movie. AoU must also be bigger and better than its predecessor and also fit into the future plans of phase 3 of MCU expansion. Then, what can a storyteller do in that setting? What freedom do a storyline have, being a part of this sequel major franchise machinery? With AoU, nothing it seems, as the movie paved way for bigger questions, rather than focusing on concluding AoU... Which makes this movie weak, as it is handled as an in-between movie to greater stories further down the road.",5
"Mad Scientists and Monsters, But not end of the line",24 April 2015,"If you are reading this review, then 9 out of times you will watch this movie, even if I trash it to the pit. Why? Simple. Because they are ""The Avengers"" and we love them for that. But, am I going to trash it? Read on.

When one of Tony Stark's haywire experiments goes haywire, the Earth's mightiest heroes are given another excuse to flex their muscles, crash buildings as if they are made of legos, perform insane stunts with all possible modes of transportation, prank each other's style, confront the past, fight amongst themselves, win an unwinnable antagonist and in the process, save the world (again!).

I was one of those (few) who felt that,despite the brilliant attempt, the Avengers (2012) at 8+/10 in IMDb was slightly overrated. But the sheer pleasure of watching so many superheroes within a single frame can be happily overwhelming for anyone. But this time around, the movie is a lot more than just the superheroes.

Where the movie succeeds: Unlike Avengers(2012), this has a much deeper storyline and gives us a good glimpse into the human side of the superheroes. This takes the story of Marvel Universe into the next stage, with the I-stone being clearly explained for the first time in a Marvel movie. Introduction of the twins adds fuel to the fire and the latter burns brightly. Taking cue from any Marvel movie, CGI and wit are the usual stand-outs. SuperHeroes, no matter how super they are , have a past and that past makes a presence here and there in the movie. Hawkeye is actually given a sizable role rather than being a weak link (as in the previous installment).

Where the movie fails: Too much talking in an action movie can be cumbersome for an action- buff especially if he/she doesn't care a penny as to how the characters feel. Loki's wit is definitely missed with the ever- serious Ultron. When our superheroes can't stop fighting among themselves, we doubt if they really deserve the ""super"" in superheroes. Cheated upon when I hoped for a Post credit scene was the ultimate disappointment. With every passing movie, I am tired of this end-of-the-world-if-we-don't-stop-him scenario. It's time someone took a fresh look at it.

Thus I have presented Black and White of said movie. You can choose either or you can choose grey (like me). But something tells me that you have already made your choice. Let me know what you think of the movie.

PS: Someone else besides Thor lifts Mjolnir (the Hammer) (and not just once).",8
Entertaining but a touch disappointing,2 July 2020,"Expectations were high going into this and there was just no way it would ever measure up. After a solid phase two I initially felt it was solid but was disappointed mostly in the lackluster villain. That being said watching it all these years later it's quite thrilling. The characters are developed a bit more but not in the way you'd like them to be and the film does have some dragging sequences. That being said the new characters are fantastic Scarlet Witch played by Elizabeth Olsen is fierce and Quicksilver played by hottie Aaron Taylor Johnson is fun. The film is darker but the central group is as entertaining as ever. Sure there's a few blips along the way but it still stands as a fine piece of entertainment.

Budget: $250m Box Office: $1.4B

A fun film that sets up the third act.,26 May 2019,"A great film with plenty of action, humor, and a surprising amount of excellent minor character development (which makes sense, since they didn't get their own movies between the last ""Avengers"" and this one). Still, the numerous hinted references will come on deaf ears for anyone who hasn't seen all the ""phase 2"" films, or knows about some of the details from the original source materials. That being said, this was a fun film that sets up the final conflicts for the closing act of the Avengers saga.",8
The heros have to face against an evil guy- Ultron,29 November 2015,"It's cool, buddy!!! Tons of special effcts and bunch of famous actors. the scenery was fantastic. When they were fighting against villains, the reality totally attracted me. In my opinion, Avengers 2 is the most successful movies of Marvel cause they've collected millions dollars just in the first week it appeared in cinemas. So, if i continue this review, there'll just be praises,NOTHING ELSE!!! Incredibly expensive action scenes full of destruction go on for way too long with little context behind them, leading to overkill and boredom. ike the first film, what makes the sequel work is how director Joss Whedon builds the action on this character foundation and injects it with just enough humor to make its personality radiate.",9
You Can't Think About This Movie,8 October 2017,"OK, I'm going to preface this review by saying that overall I am a fan of the MCU and I think they've given the world a fair few really good movies and the remaining ones are almost always OK. That feat is something that is commendable and something that I doubt will ever be recaptured over a series that has this many movies in it.

Now that that is out of the way let's get our hands dirty.

Avengers: Age of Ultron is a dumb movie. That in of itself isn't a damning thing really, a lot of great movies are dumb and rely more on emotions to connect the audience to the plot but in this movie the emotional connection is very scarce which is pretty unforgivable for a movie nearly 2.5 hours in length. There are two emotional parts to the movie which are both short parts to the film that I found to be much more engaging and relatable than the rest of the movie as a whole and I would be much more interested in an MCU movie that simply expanded on them. These two parts being the party where the Avengers are all hanging about and interacting in a way that reminded me that these actors are actually all really talented. like seriously, who here forgot that this cast has been nominated for a combined 9 Oscars? Anyway the other scene is where the group spends a few days isolated on one of their members property. Once again I'd love to see an entire movie focused solely on these characters and how they get along but we will never get that film so oh well.

The action in the movie is good if not a little too clean for a movie in which there is a explosive highway chase, a flying city and a derailed train but this is technically a Disney flick so I'll let it slide.

The thing that I do not intend to let slide is the emotional manipulation that the movie tries to pass of to its audience. I find it pretty absurd that the same people who have accomplished so much with Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Guardians of the Galaxy, and even Dr. Strange are willing to turn in such canned and phony plot beats and call it an Avengers movie. I mean the first movie even has a scene that perfectly explains exactly what this movie tries to un-ironically accomplish (the scene with the bloody trading cards if you were wondering). It is really something that stops me every time I think about re watching this movie because it irks me too much. Every single new character is treated with the same level of tragic backstory as a middle-schooler's OC in a fanfiction, its pathetic.

But at the end of the day if you are willing to simply go into a movie and be satisfied with people punching things to solve their problems then you will be fine with this movie. Just try not to think about it too much, you may accidentally put more thought into it than the writers.",5

Avengers: Age of Ultron,12 March 2016,,10
Very good for a beginner,31 October 2017,"I'd give this 8.5/10

This was the first Marvel Movie that I ever saw and it did take a while to get me interested. Ultron was one of the better villains and he certainly deserves a sequel film. Why are people slagging this off? Yes it's different to the first Avengers but even that wasn't the best Marvel film so stop saying it is. Ultron is better than many of the Marvel films. The character was intelligent and hard to beat unlike Loki. For some reason I already knew Hulk despite it being my first Marvel film so the character development deserves credit. The only real problem with the film is that some of the build up is a bit random. Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch were great and they are what we want in the Marvel films, anyone who preferred Loki just because he's Thor's brother needs to rethink. I like Loki but Ultron makes a better villain so Jack Spade needs to make a come back. CGI by the way was awesome, didn't occur to me that people would find destroying Sokolvia an issue until Captain America Civil War. That film basically tells us that the Avengers did a bad job which does ruin the plot slightly.

Age Of Ultron 2 would be great. So would reviving Quick Silver",8
A joke,7 February 2020,"This movie had so much more potential. Quicksilver's death was one of the worst deaths ever. It tried to make us feel for a character that we literally do not care about and the only true purpose it serves is to introduce Wanda and Vision and I guess build up Civil War, even though the events of the first Avengers movie could have done that.",5
I good Movie filled with what we all wanted so see..,21 May 2015,,8
Love this film so much,16 February 2016,"Best movie I've ever seen. The main antagonist is my favorite villain so far in the MCU, and Ultron was made even better by the fact he was voiced by James Spader, an actor who didn't even change his voice for the role. This was a movie that kept you guessing, and not even I could prepare for the climax. No wonder this series keeps moving in the place of where others have failed. Iron Man remains the best Avenger, and Vision, Quicksilver, and Scarlet Witch are very welcome additions to the cast of characters. This is a must-see for those wanting a good movie (or one that leaves you on the edge of your seat), and one for those who love comic books.",10

Avengers: Age of Ultron - review,3 May 2015,,2
Impressive Sequel,22 May 2015,,8
One great thrill ride.,3 May 2015,"For some reason, or another this film seems to have a mixed bag of reviews, some love it while others hate this piece. Want an honest review??? When the studio reached the 'point of no return' by getting to The Avengers, it was the first Marvel film to reach the billion dollar mark. Up until this point, most of the Marvel based films received good reviews. What went wrong?? It seems to always be the common denominator, the audience. Movie goers seem to get more nit-picky of films that have background material these days. They keep praying that the producers keep 'messing up' on their favorite comic book characters. However, I mean no disrespect to anyone. This being said, it puts more pressure on the studios to do their job right. This is why films like Spiderman 3 failed to bring full force is because Sam Raimi could not give the script he wanted full treatment. Now that I have laid down some ground in the way Nick Fury would, as if talking to the team, here's my review of this movie. It's good to see new and old faces. With the grouping of the characters in Age Of Ultron, it's difficult to really put character emphasis on any one or two superheroes. We know the ones we've already seen in the Marvel Universe. Once again, this is part of the start of phase two in the writing process of both the films and Agents Of Shield. We got to see the alien life force from the first Avengers, so it makes sense that Age Of Ultron would have robots to accompany Ultron himself, seeing that he has to upload himself to a machine in the first place. This also eludes to the reveal that Marvel fans will eventually get of Thanos. Not only that, but now Spiderman will be able to join the roster again. Everybody knows that Agent Colson is still alive, so we have yet to see him show up again, but more than likely, will stay with Shield. What makes this film special?? I think it's the Scarlet Witch who taps into the minds of others, making them face their fears of their past. Bottom line is, don't let anyone tell you what you should and shouldn't watch. Sometimes you have to test the waters,......trust me, if you relax and sit back you just might enjoy this piece of film you may call 'a piece of crap'.",9
"Don't hate it, it's OK",13 March 2016,"The sequel to the Avengers was no doubt one of the most hipped movies in history. Everyone waited for the dark knight of Marvel's All Star Team and dispute the fact that the first was better Age of Ultron in all honest did not disappoint me in any way. All the cast members played their roles nice the villain Ultron had truly the power and capacity to be a real danger to the world. Also the ending was quit fitting and set quit good the seen for the follow Marvel movies. In my point of view the movie fell victim to the population of angry nerds, who try find errors even to excellent superhero films, because now the fact that know every minor thing about the superheroes and heroines, who have become box office giants, give them advantage over the rest film-lovers and they use it to show their self as all knowing and the rest are idiots. Listen everyone I am also a divot follower to the pantheon of superheroes and I say its fine, if you like superheroes in cinema and just happen to know a thing or two more ,then go introduce the new generation to this world, do not use it to show how amazing you believe you are. Remember with great power comes great responsibility.",8
"""Avengers: A House Divided""",25 July 2024,"!! Possible Spoilers!!

*Avengers: Age of Ultron* is a complex and ambitious sequel that expands the Marvel Cinematic Universe while delving deeper into the characters. While it boasts impressive action sequences and thought-provoking themes, the film struggles to maintain the same level of cohesion and charm as its predecessor.

Joss Whedon's script is ambitious, exploring the psychological toll of superhero life and the dangers of unchecked technology. The introduction of Ultron, a menacing artificial intelligence voiced by James Spader, provides a compelling antagonist. However, the film's attempt to balance multiple storylines and character arcs often feels rushed and uneven.

The ensemble cast delivers strong performances, with Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, and Mark Ruffalo reprising their iconic roles with conviction. The addition of Elizabeth Olsen as Scarlet Witch and Aaron Taylor-Johnson as Quicksilver brings fresh energy to the team. However, some characters, such as Hawkeye and Black Widow, are underutilized.

The film's action sequences are undeniably impressive, with the Battle of Sokovia being a particular highlight. The visual effects are top-notch, creating a sense of scale and wonder. However, the film's tone shifts dramatically between moments of humor and intense drama, resulting in an inconsistent viewing experience.

*Avengers: Age of Ultron* is a film with lofty ambitions that ultimately falls short of its full potential. It's a complex and divisive entry in the MCU that offers both exhilarating highs and disappointing lows.",8
"With sweeping emotion and more of that joyous banter, Joss Whedon defies expectations.",24 April 2015,"Although it was perhaps never in doubt that 2012's The Avengers would be big, most didn't expect it's balancing act of character moments, fist-pumping action and incredible one- liners would be as joyously fun as it was. Joss Whedon, the genius behind Buffy and Firefly, had pulled off a major feat, one that will stand as a benchmark for Marvel for years to come. Therein lies the scale of the task Whedon had with Age of Ultron. How do you improve on a film as good as that?

Somehow, he and the brilliant cast have pulled it off. It's not without it's stumbles. In a film of this size, and with a mammoth cast, there are times when the numerous stands over- reach and become a little hard to follow. A particular sub-plot detour feels very unnecessary, and in a melting pot of emotion and motivations, there are a few characters (Thor and Quicksilver) that feel a little short-changed. This is, however, missing the point completely. Whilst Loki is most likely unmatched in the MCU for villainy, Ultron is a marvelous creation; one that feels like a step forward for the Studio's approach in 'Phase Three'. Created by Tony Stark as an 'end game'; the ultimate peace-keeper that would put the Avengers out of the Avenging business for good, Ultron represents the failings of humanity as a race, whilst also planting the seeds for Cap and Iron Man's ideological differences in Captain America: Civil War. His arc is effectively played as a tragedy; he is only what Stark and Banner intended him to be, twisted and ruined by the violence of the past, hellbent on securing an 'evolution'. The tone here is one that walks a tight-rope between sombre and the usual light, witty banter. Whedon's skill is in the perfect balance he strikes; we feel the stakes and feel the emotion, but the banter between the group is at it's fan-serving best here. So much so I would be content if we had a 2 hour couch session with these brilliantly defined, effortlessly genuine characters.

Wasted in Assemble, Jeremy Renner's Hawkeye is given surprisingly heartfelt screen time, with Whedon thoughtfully casting him as the solid anchor of the group. Scarlett Johannson continues her great work, bringing a vulnerability to Black Widow that belies her troubled past. Her romance with Mark Ruffalo's Hulk provides the majority of the heart-wrenching emotion, a beautiful gut-punch that undercuts the action and brings even more humanity to all the geeky, joyous action on display. Downey Jr., Evans and Hemsworth bristle with chemistry and charisma, and we see a more developed, empathetic Stark here; his being responsible for Ultron, and the subsequent guilt he feels, is a driving force behind the story. As a whole, this cast is dynamite, and in a fantastic early scene, provide hilarious moments. Ultimately, however, we want to see them kick ass, and Whedon brings a plethora of thrilling, nerd-gasmic set-pieces that more than match that magnificent tracking shot in Assemble. More than ever, we see the Avengers as a working battle force, using each others' abilities in ingenious, hugely entertaining ways. Plus, this time out there's the Hulkbuster.

Unsurprisingly, time is spent inevitably setting up future movies, but whilst unnecessary, the easter eggs don't distract from the narrative of the film too much. New additions are also immensely successful. Whilst Elizabeth Olsen is impressive as Scarlet Witch, Paul Bettany's Vision steals the film, and bags many of the film's best moments. He has always been a terrific actor, but here he exudes class and charisma, providing an at once cold, but wise and naive character whose existence in the MCU is nothing but exciting. Marvel continue to build and progress, but without losing the charm and aching humanity that has defined their best. Avengers: Age of Ultron finds this sweetspot effortlessly.",5
Avengers age of ultron,27 July 2022,,8
I liked it,31 March 2016,"I feel like it really wasn't as bad as everyone said it was. A movie like this generates a lot of hype, but i see no reason why it didn't live up to that hype. The effects were spectacular, and Ultron as a villain was ultimately very compelling and entertaining. The vision was also a very nice addition. Out of all the movies in the MCU, this scores pretty high on my list. I mean come on, any movie that shows Tony Stark in full hulkbuster armor, taking on the hulk can't be that bad, right?

""The city is flying, we're fighting an army of robots, and I have a bow and arrow. None of this makes sense.""

I mean come on, man! That line is classic! Hopefully when Civil War comes out people won't bitch about it as much.",8
Great fun with a few glaring flaws,3 May 2015,"Firstly, Age of Ultron is a good movie. I'm going to pick apart a few mingling annoyances. But these are still minor gripes, and ultimately, this is the most fun I've had in a theater since Guardians of the Galaxy. I did not leave the theater thinking I'd wasted time and money, I left enthusiastically chatting with my viewing companions about what would happen next.

Which, in a way, is my biggest criticism of the film. Whereas the first Avengers felt like something that could stand on it's own, Age of Ultron falls a bit short of that, investing a significant amount of the film setting up the next movie. Sure, we all knew a third was coming, but I went to see Age of Ultron, not an extended trailer for the next one. And though setting up the next in the series isn't a bad thing, if I were to have watched Age of Ulton without a passing knowledge of the comics, I would have felt some of the character actions seemed very random and confusing.

The other big issue I have with the film is the inconsistency of character development. I couldn't help but notice that, whenever the action winded down, these characters were all painted as these flawed and troubled people with varied motivations. Then the action would start, and it was like a switch had flipped and every character starts whipping out witty one-liners (to mixed success), as if the characters knew there was enough else going on that they didn't have to carry the film anymore.

Let me say it again; I had a great time. And maybe I'm hitting that wall. Seeing so many super-hero movies lately, I could be reaching heroics saturation point. I don't know. But I can't honestly say I enjoyed Age of Ultron quite as much as it's predecessor.",8

Avengers; Age of Ultron Review,3 May 2015,"Avengers Age of Ultron was an amazing experience for me to watch. It's a little bit more fast-paced that other Marvel productions. It didn't have that much plot like in the first Avengers, but it definitely had a lot more of fun action-packed sequences to watch and was a lot funnier. I have never heard so much laughter come from a full-house movie theater audience watching a Marvel movie in my whole life. I think, personally, this movie would have had some more plot if it didn't have cut a 1/2 hour of footage. There were some pieces that would have made more sense with some more explanation in the movie. This movie did have a lot of characters,unlike other Superhero films, but it's an Avengers films; they need plenty of characters to interact with each other in order to have that 'Superhero Team-Up Feeling'. AoU was a little over advertised on TV with the millions of different TV spots, but I was still shocked by certain events in the movie, even though I saw too many trailers and previews and did some research of the film.

Was I happy walking out of the theater after the movie was over? Yes. I can't lie about that.

Was I satisfied? Not fully. There were some minor downers, but it's hard to make a sequel to a movie with so many characters and so many expectations. Even with the downers, it had some surprisingly awesome moments that made the movie entertaining.

Do I think this movie will help set up a big chunk of future titles in the MCU? Totally. 100%. You can see how this movie will help set up Phase 3 of Marvel and how some of the characters will act during the next phase.

Overall, I give this an 8 out of 10. Not bad for a sequel, but not the greatest sequel of all time. It's still a pretty good movie to watch. I'd recommend it.",8

just OK,17 March 2020,"Generally speaking, it didn't reach the first experience that I wanted to make people feel right away. Both funny and flaming are not enough, which should be the weak law of the sequel movie. The appearance of many characters is dazzling, but they are still distinct. Jarvis and Vison are amazingly fit, and there are not many twins. The emotional drama of widow and Hulk is the softest moment. Not fierce enough, the captain swears Thor Thor hammer joke throughout.",8
Avengers Age of Ultron,3 November 2019,"Avengers Age of Ultron is in my opinion an underrated movie. It's not as good as the first but it's still very good. The film isn't as dark as the trailers made it look which was disappointing. And at times the film got a little unfocused when it had to set up other films. Once again the cast is great and the are some great action scenes. The new characters are good and the villain was good but I wished he was darker and less goofy. Still there is a lot to enjoy in the movie.

Avengers: Age of Ambivalence,28 March 2016,"Ambivalent. That's the word I would use when describing what it was like watch Earth's Mightiest Heroes in their second crack together in the ever-growing Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) in Avengers: Age of Ultron (AoU). In another word, it was bittersweet. It was underwhelming yet exhilarating, sometimes bland and sometimes superb, it left you satisfied, yet wanting worlds more. The Age of Ambivalence.

What it did great:

Age of Ultron first and foremost does one thing better than any other superhero movie has been able to do before it; it showcases the incredible accuracy of power and excitement behind each and every hero on screen. The film's greatest strength is its ability to take iconic heroes that have been around for decades and bring them all as close to their full-power, comic book form that we've ever seen, and it's magnificent. Hulk smashes and jumps like never before, Thor fights and flies like a true demi-god, and director Joss Wheedon definitely learned how to write Captain America's full power into an Avengers film, thanks in part to the Russo brother's successful attempt at re- tooling the Captain in 2014's spectacular ""The Winter Solider"". The bottom line is, that all of the mentioned and unmentioned heroes (Iron Man, Vision, Hawkeye, etc.) in the film are a constant thrill to watch. No matter the fight. Watching our favorite heroes in Age of Ultron was like watching a comic book unfold before my eyes, and I was wowed with simply how much fun it was to watch these heroes in their biggest and best form yet.

Another great thing AoU is able to have to its name is an outstanding cast, with each member delivering the greatest continuing performance to their individual characters in superhero film history. Robert Downey Jr. is practically Iron Man in real life, Mark Ruffalo has only gotten better as Bruce Banner/Hulk, and all of the newcomers, including Paul Bettany (The Vision), Elizabeth Olsen (Scarlet Witch), Aaron-Taylor Johnson (Quicksilver) and James Spader (Ultron) only add to the endless pool of talent found within the MCU. The chemistry between all of these characters is strong and seamless, only solidifying the film's accuracy to a live-action comic book. Although the screenplay itself might not have necessarily been dipped in gold, every actor is able to play their character to a tee, and it continues to be a joy to watch them on screen film after film.

What it did good:

In the first Avengers film we spent the majority of the movie watching our heroes slowly build into the superhero team we now know and love. There was more necessary character development that was vital to making us care and ultimately lose our minds when Earth's Mightiest Heroes finally worked things out and teamed up. In AoU, right off the bat we hop into Avengers-heavy action and it's wonderful. The team has been established, we know the characters, and it was nice to not have to waste too much time waiting for a big action scene to unfold. The opening action sequence is grand, and one of the best scenes in the film. It gives the audience the awareness that they are an established team now, with every hero working together to effortlessly take down the opposition.

As the eleventh film in the MCU, Age of Ultron was sure to continue building the future stepping stones for the years to come and did just that. The seeds of Captain America: Civil War were planted, and the furthering growth of the road inevitable Infinity War was also very much felt in the film. These things are great for the future of the franchise, but distract from what really is important in the movie, which brings me to my final section.

What it did bad:

While the MCU is a vast one indeed, and many stories have been and will continue to be told, Age of Ultron spent far too much time as a Phase 3 setup film, rather than focusing more time on the story at hand, and Ultron himself. Too often does the film divert its attention away from the story it's trying to tell, and off into territories that have to do with movies 3, 4 years down the line, or subplots like the Bruce/Black Widow romance, which was wasted time that could have been spent further fleshing out Ultron and his evil, yet enticing plans. Even the mid- credits scene was a Infinity War tease. Ultron is one of Marvel's greatest villains, and a wonderful Avengers foe. The sad truth is that, even with James Spader's delightful voicing of the character, Ultron is a massively underwhelming antagonist, which is a heavy disappointment given the potential there was in the character.

The bleak development of Ultron and his story also create cracks in the road of pacing throughout the film, with several scenes feeling rushed and jumbled up. Overall the film sustains a solid flow, but too often does it feel like Joss Wheedon and his team had to stuff 5 tons of content into a 2 ton bag, rushing to deliver a satisfying immediate story and at the same time setup the lager MCU story.

Age of Ultron is a great film, but it's hot and cold. It's packed with exhilarating action scenes, it's colorful with gorgeous CGI, and every hero on screen has never been more fun to watch, period. The acting is flawless, and the connection to the future of the MCU raises numerous questions that are exciting to contemplate. However, it has occasionally sloppy pacing, it fails to tell a full story and there's a unfortunate lack of development for the title character. Avengers: Age of Ultron may have its flaws, but at the end of the day, it stands as a worthy sequel to its 2012 predecessor, and an overall enjoyable entry into the distinguished Marvel Cinematic Universe.

"The second most ridiculous movie after ""Transformers""",23 May 2015,"I disliked the first ""Avengers"" movie quite much, but thought to myself ""well, this movie is not about the plot or the quality, it's about big explosions and interesting fighting scenes that you only get if you break the laws of nature"" I would not have watched it a second time, but then I saw that the sequel ""Age of Ultron"" received ratings from 4-5 stars from any source I'd seen so I gave it a chance. .... To quote ""Family Guy"": The last thing that got me THAT confused was ""Transformers 3"": ""Why do they still allow these guys to make movies???"" .... This movie is for children, not for adults or anything between! Eight year-olds might forget about the repetition, the redundance, the lack of anything a brain is made for. And that's OK! This movie has around the same amount of content as a Disney Channel production, when I was a child I loved the Disney Channel. But nobody would give a Disney Channel production a HIGHER rating than ""Interstellar"", ""Gravity"", ""Sweeney Todd"" or ""Ex Machina"" (and yes, also ""Avatar"")! .... It is OK, if the user-rating is merely an indicator for the profitability of a movie, this is a big help for anybody who wants to create a movie. But in my opinion it is the responsibility of so called ""EXPERTS"" to give a rating based on QUALITY and ARTISTIC VALUE! This is necessary to promote movie-companies' effort on creating innovative and sophisticated movies too.

Because money will always be more attracted to popcorn-cinema, at least our and the experts' respect should give those who really put effort into making a great movie, and who sometimes take great risk, the reward that they deserve.",1
The weakest of the series...,27 March 2019,,8
i love Captain,30 April 2020,"As a loyal fans, of Marvel Pictures, I want to praise this commercial work unreservedly: good-looking, good-looking! How exciting!

For other Marvel works, a remarkable step forward is that on the basis of enough action drama, the usual heroism in the United States has become obscure, while team consciousness and humanitarianism have become supreme. (spoilers) the cloud rescue city is the pinnacle of the most wonderful part, and the little clues of the hero ""TASK"" are clear rather than fancy personal show.

At the end of the film is a gathering of Marvel cosmic heroes: when the American captain says goodbye to Banner, Thor and Stark, standing at the new Avengers training base and shouting ""Avengers"" at Natasha, scarlet witches, war machines, falcons! I seem to have seen a new beginning in the Marvel universe.

Some netizens on the rotten tomato website said the film lacked a humanistic core. I would like to say that first of all, this is a commercial work, second, it is science fiction, the important point is that its production is for Marvel fans, it is not an independent work, to shoot the human core, I am afraid to lose a lot of audience.

I think the action of ""duplicate 2"" is very successful, without losing the science fiction component, not like the soft science fiction that the comment says.",8
Still good superhero fun,9 December 2019,"I see a lot of negative reviews directed at the humor in this movie. All I can say is that Marvel, since the beginning, has used this same format for their movies so I don't understand why ""fans"" are now criticizing the banter.",9
Movies,11 May 2019,It looks realistic. The characters are just like the people in comic books. It's original. I loved it.,10
"Amazing action, but no script",18 May 2015,"It's quite difficult to review negatively one of my favorite franchises since I saw the first Avengers movie and totally loved it.

But this film is not quite impressive as it seems to be. Joss Whedon had to stick to his plan: in Avengers the first, he managed to balance everything in order. Script was nearly perfect and action scenes were quite impressive but not too overwhelming. You felt (in Avengers first deliver) that it was not another Transformer-ish, Michael Bay-ish, film.

Although darkish than the first one, Age of Ultron lacks of originality, but its worst flaw is the lack of well crafted dialog. Everything is mayhem. Chaotic. Script does not stand alone for its merits. This goes right for an action film, or kind of a B-movie. But we were expecting more. There are at least three or four amazing scenes with superb CGI, and again, Whedon gives every hero its right place, but something is missing comparing the two Avengers movies: script of the first one was flawless, this one is not.

I know it's a high standard with a major casting. So we're expecting the best. And on script terms, the movie does not deliver a bit.

Our villain (Ultron) is weaker -conceptually- than Loki. The man (or machine) is blabbering the whole movie through with unintelligible concepts, and some of the cast members looks too tired to carry on (Samuel L. Jackson, Scarlett Johansson, Robert Downey Jr.) . I have an awkward feeling about this flick. The waiting took too long. Joss Whedon decided to present action before drama, nonsense chaos before logic. So then the results are quite obvious. He was too eagering to create a new Avengers generation when the actual one had not the opportunity to fly high.

Man, this is as cheesy as can be. One-dimensional story.

Our expectations, as fans of the first one, were not at all fulfilled. This looks like another Transformer's movie.

Whatever happened to Thanos (end credits in the first one), I cannot guess. Studios and budgets can spoil everything. I felt they ruined a wonderful saga. Let's hope the next one surpass this second part, totally forgettable.

I mean, it's not a bad movie, but on Avengers standards, this is a bluff.

Cheers!",5
Everything Except,11 August 2017,,9
"Whedon inserts new elements presented in the most recent films of the characters, and expanding the story to a more global level",2 March 2020,"It is no secret that the challenge is enormous. In addition to maintaining the great quality of the films of this second phase of Marvel, Joss Whedon tries to overcome himself here, since the first Avengers is practically a unanimity between critics and the public. And he manages to reach a similar level, delivering yet another spectacular film in every way, inserting new elements presented in the most recent films of the characters, and expanding the story to a more global level. Whedon, who once again does not have to tell origin stories, let alone find a good reason to reunite all the heroes again, is free to go straight to the point, going straight to the plot.

Trying to protect the planet from threats like those seen in the first The Avengers, Tony Stark seeks to build an artificial intelligence system that would take care of world peace. The project ends up going wrong and generates the birth of Ultron (voice of James Spader). Captain America (Chris Evans), Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) will have to come together again save the day.

Whedon already begins the film with a spectacular action scene, where the skills of several heroes are shown during the invasion of one of the bases of H.I.D.R.A, where they recover the Scepter of Loki, an inexhaustible source of energy and psychic control. In parallel, seeking to keep the local population safe, drones commanded by Jarvis (at the behest of Stark) try to reduce collateral damage, but they are not welcomed in these eastern European lands. Tony's project has already started, creating an immediate cohesion with Extremis technology, which we saw in Iron Man 3, right after they recovered the artifact that gives Tony Stark the possibility to advance in the project he developed with Dr. Bruce Banner. In Stark's conception, it would be the end of the group, while they would be replaced by a ""bigger shield"", an omniscient protection that they themselves could not overcome, something very similar to what we saw in Captain America: The Winter Soldier. Once an arms manufacturer, Iron Man continues to be forced to face the result of his past actions. Becoming a superhero was part of the process of dealing with that awareness. Now, becoming a global defender is an even more powerful opportunity in that sense.

As in the first Avengers, the meeting of the heroes is cohesive and well balanced. There is no central character taking on a more important posture, not even Captain America who is the leader of the group in the comics and also in the films. As a matter of fact, characters who did not have such a large participation in the last film, have the chance to participate more effectively in the plot as a whole. It is like that with the Black Widow and the Hulk, who end up building an important sexual tension between them, putting on the agenda the possibility of a possible relationship, showing two traumatized and fragile people who hope to live a normal life together, away from the Avengers and of everything that implies this coexistence. The similarities between both characters already existed, but the script highlights and seeks them. Another highlight is Gavião Arqueiro, a happy and married man with two children and one more on the way. This relationship between Gavião and his wife, the fact that they live in isolation and his relationship with his family is explored. In fact, this isolated and calm place is where heroes try to recover from nightmares that torment them from that point on.

New characters were also introduced efficiently. James Spader is the android Ultron. He, who acted in person and later was replaced by computer graphics of motion capture, is undoubtedly the great success. The actor, basically with his voice, lends a threatening, cold and even ironic tone to the villain, who dictates that to solve a problem you must eliminate its source: the Avengers and humanity. Its triumphal entry seems to have been taken directly from a horror film. We don't have a simple homicidal machine in it, but something completely human, which makes it even more terrifying.

Speaking of motion capture, there is no way to mention the participation of Andy Serkis (the Gollum of ""The Lord of the Rings"", the Caesar of ""The Planet of the Apes"", the King Kong of the Peter Jackson remake) in the skin of the dealer of arms Ulysses Klaue in a cameo. He is responsible for removing the vibranium metal from the African nation of Wakanda and selling it on the black market. It's the same alloy that makes up Captain America's shield, it's the material that Ultron needs to build his indestructible body.

We also have the twins Wanda and Pietro Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen and Aaron Taylor-Johnson), known in the comics as Mercury and Scarlet Witch. Since Marvel / Disney does not own the rights to the mutant word, owned by FOX in theaters, it was up to Joss Whedon to reinvent the origin of the characters. In the film, the brothers are the result of experiments conducted by Baron Wolfgang von Strucker (Thomas Kretschmann), a scientist at HYDRA, a Nazi organization that extended its tentacles within the spy agency S.H.I.E.L.D. - as shown last year in ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"". Pietro has super speed as a characteristic and participates well in some good action scenes. But it is Wanda who gains more prominence and importance due to his powers of manipulating reality - and perception. In comics, she combines her changing power to alter reality with witchcraft, a mixture that, in the cinema, could be confused. Joss Whedon simplifies the equation, giving him telekinesis combined with the power to invade minds, unlocking unconscious fears from his ""victims"".

One of the new heroes to be worked on is Vision (also Paul Bettany). A perfect adaptation of the character on the pages, the creature appears simplifying all its concepts from the comic books, but at the same time keeping them intact. The android Visão, created by the film's own villain to harbor his conscience, but which ends up ""rescued"" by the heroes, becoming his ally. Vision is, in fact, a ""symptom"", an artificial person with his own thoughts. Interestingly, Vision and the Scarlet Witch formed, in the comics, one of Marvel's most unlikely couples. It is not impossible to imagine that the novel is also mirrored in cinema.

The film has a darker, darker tone, but it has a balance that doesn't let it get too serious at any time. Like any Marvel movie, the movie is full of jokes, mostly good ones. At no point does the film stop amusing itself in the midst of action that does not disappoint once again. As already shown before, we have important ethical discussions between Captain America and Iron Man. Steve Rogers is the perfect opposite to the idea, which flirts with totalitarianism, of a corporate peacekeeping force, acting on foreign soil, of Iron Man. This discussion could have been further explored and debated in the script, generating consequences for the Age of Ultron, not just a prelude to the coming Civil War.

One of the differences from the previous film that brought together the heroes is the relationship between the characters. There are many more scenes of interaction between everyone, however the number and scale of the action scenes is even greater, which was a little exaggerated in certain sequences, which seem to come directly from the comic book pages to the big screen. Despite this, they are visually creative, beautiful and imposing scenes. Among the main action scenes, we can highlight the invasion of the H.I.D.R.A hideout, the scene of the appearance of Ultron in the middle of the party where the Avengers are gathered; the scenes on the African Coast; the fight between Hulk and Hulkbuster (with Tony Stark in special armor); the fight and chase involving the Black Widow, the Captain and Ultron in public transport through the streets of Seoul, in addition to the great final battle in Sokovia. The scenarios of the confrontations are completely different from those of The Avengers, leaving luxurious New York for marginal environments, much more impoverished, but also much more human. In the plot, the evil presence also denotes more impact, gravity in the situation, as, given the much larger number of characters, it becomes uncertain who will survive and who will die.

Avengers: Age of Ultron is yet another hit by Marvel, creating a unique and exciting experience for the general public. Joss Whedon knows how few combine action, drama, science fiction and humor in one film to amuse everyone. There was no shortage of destroyed cities, shattered robots and spectacular scenes, whether in the air or on land. With the terrain prepared, it remains to await The Civil War, which will show the split between heroes.",8
Very Enjoyable,30 May 2015,"This was in my top 3 most anticipated movies of 2015, I was so excited to see this film! And I'd say it more or less delivered.

I'll start with the positives. Firstly, it's great to see the team back together. By this point each of the Avengers are beloved characters in their own right and to see Earth's mightiest heroes back together is of course fantastic, especially for big Marvel fans like myself. The entertaining chemistry among the group that we saw in the first film is even stronger in Age of Ultron which allows for plenty of comic relief which is always refreshing. I've seen some negative comments about the humour in this film which I think is ridiculous. The Avengers are a team, they're friends, of course they're going to crack jokes they're not zombies. Plus DC already supplies us with the bleak side of comic book movies so I think it's nice that Marvel want to make their films a bit more colourful. Also I think that the new additions to the team, Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver, will please audiences, although I do think that Quicksilver was better portrayed in X:men: Days of Future Past.

I like Ultron as the villain as well. James Spader voices him perfectly, giving the character an intriguing charm but making him the sinister supervillain that we deserved. Ultron was quite an intelligent adversary for the Avengers so he wasn't simply physically menacing.

I was happy with the pacing of the film as well, the action started immediately and continued throughout, although there were of course pauses in the action to give room for the narrative. However I do think certain aspects of Ultron's character were rushed but overall the pacing was fast which works well in a film like the Avengers.

The action sequences are of course great. The visual effects are stunning and as I've already outlined seeing all of the Avengers together battling an army is glorious. I do accept however that seeing this for the first time in the first movie was probably more incredible.

As a big fan of Marvel I went into this film with some hopes, a sought of checklist for things I wanted to see and questions that I wanted to be answered. For the most part my desires were met but there was one question in particular concerning how Captain America's shield is broken. The broken shield was shown at the end of the first trailer and although it was addressed in the film, I wasn't satisfied with it's reveal when I finally saw the film because me and my friends had come up with so many cool theories as to how it could have been broken and who could have broken it.

As a whole though I had a lot of fun with Avengers: Age of Ultron. Fans on Marvel should enjoy this movie a lot and for those who are not seasoned Marvel fans this film is very accessible.",8
Successful Sequel,7 June 2015,,9
"Vision & Scarlet Witch Fans, Stay Home",8 May 2015,"Vision's origin (and Ultron's) is completely screwed up (again, no Hank Pym) and he (and Ultron) are nothing extraordinary. This was the problem as predicted since Iron Man (2008) with JARVIS instead of Jarvis and Iron Man 3 (2013) with JARVIS already being a hero and having a body – multiple bodies – via independent control of the various armors.

Vision's looks such as skin and eyes are also a complete departure from the source material and the actor playing him wasn't interested in the role, only the amount of money an utterly misguided director offered for him to take it, someone who was said to be a ""purist"" regarding the source material, at least as far as Iron Man's chest plate. Apparently that's only for armor, not androids. (I'd have been more okay with something like John Byrne's take than this. I saw where the director quit Twitter; maybe he should stay on Twitter, quit Hollywood and comics.) The best to be hoped for from that is that the actor's disinterest comes across as Vizh's normally stolid personality, but even Vision did talk shows to (re)acquaint himself to the public with his ""Second Debut"" (comics.org/issue/46843); this guy wouldn't.

Scarlet Witch's powers are also completely altered and nothing unique – just ""The Avengers' Jean Grey.""

If you're a fan of either of these pillars of Avengers membership, pass on AoU. If you do go, remember, you _can_ walk out and ask for a refund (a credit/pass for another movie means your attendance/receipt is still counted for ""Ugh-vengers"" and you can't use it for a new release), but you can't un-see it.",1

Today's movies have come to resemble little more than the video games that preceded them; that movies like AVENGERS: AGE OF ULTRON are based on COMIC BOOKS boggles the mind: with characters long established and story lines quite literally laid out in easy-to-follow ""storyboards,"" the apparent inability of Hollywood's ""brightest"" to cobble together anything of movie-going value is puzzling, indeed. What more do they need...? (A lifelong love of Storytelling wouldn't hurt, nor would an affinity for the Comics upon which these Big Budget Bombs are based, but the Hollywood ""elite"" seem uninterested in what has come before and clichés are heaped on clichés with all the finesse and depth of a television commercial...) A big budget doesn't necessarily denote quality.",3
Age of Disappointment,6 September 2015,"When Avengers Age of Ultron was released, due to some personal reasons, I couldn't watch it in theaters. I felt sad. When I finally did check it out on DVD a week back, I was disappointed and said..thank God, I didn't watch this in a theater.

What on earth were Joss Weldon smoking when he wrote this film. Frankly, he makes it a big mess considering that he had made the brilliant Avengers (Part 1) a few years ago.

The Avengers worked because it was pure comic book stuff. 6 superheroes make a team to stop the bad guy, Loki (deliciously played by Tom Hiddleston) who wants to rule over Earth. So simple yet so entertaining.

In Age of Ultron, Weldon tries to do Nolan and convert Avengers into a Batman Trilogy type movie which has action but is intellectual and makes the audience think. Alas, it falls flat because of the poor writing and Weldon is no Nolan.

Ultron is a great formidable villain and it is supported by the Maximoff twins. But the theme of Artificial Intelligence and the end of human race is a bit too much to digest. The end result left me sad and angry at Weldon because of the opportunity he has lost.

Its the performance of the cast and some action sequences that save the movie to a certain aspect. Hope, the next Avengers project will be as good as the 1st.",5

Tries to make up for its lack of a story with special effects,30 April 2015,"This is another over hyped movie where the consensus of critical opinion is better than it should be. The movie Avataar comes to mind. That movie too had a similar largely favorable reviews on release but was later found to be underwhelming.

The plot is thin. The birth of the Ultron is hurried, the tender moments seemed tacked, the fight scene at the end is a reprise of the fight scenes in the first Avengers movie. The birth of the Vision may be useful in later films but here he hardly plays any role. The death of Pietro is similarly accidental. The fight between the Avengers seems pointless, and looks like a school brawl. Even the looming end of the world fails to inspire any sense of urgency or dread.",4

Promising Sequel Ruined By A Weak Plot And Overuse Of C.G.I.,24 August 2015,"The first scene after the post credits have rolled in Avengers 2012, presents Loki explaining the failure of their attack on Earth to a mysterious alien, who turns and smiles at the idea of dealing with The Avengers would be ""courting death itself."" That alien is of course the previously rumored Thanos and the reason for the smile is that ""Death"" is actually personified in the Marvel Universe as someone Thanos so desperately wishes to please.

Brief plot: In the Eastern European country of Sokovia, the Avengers – Tony Stark, Steve Rogers, Thor, Bruce Banner (Hulk), Natasha Romanoff, and Clint Barton – raid a Hydra outpost led by Baron Wolfgang von Strucker, who has been experimenting on humans using the scepter previously wielded by Loki. They encounter two of Strucker's experiments – twins Pietro, who has superhuman speed, and Wanda Maximoff, who can manipulate minds and project energy – and apprehend Strucker, while Stark retrieves Loki's scepter.

Stark and Banner discover an artificial intelligence within the scepter's gem, and secretly use it to complete Stark's ""Ultron"" global defense program. The unexpectedly sentient Ultron, believing he must eradicate humanity to save Earth, eliminates Stark's A.I., J.A.R.V.I.S., and attacks the Avengers at their headquarters.

Watch the film to find out what happens next and don't miss the post credits scene that reveals more of Thanos's agenda.

Verdict: some of the characters do not do justice to their parts at all. They just act for the sake of acting, and getting a hefty paycheck at the end of filming. Samuel L. Jackson has a small role in the film as Nick Fury, and we see Stan Lee making a cameo appearance again as he did in Ant-man(2015). I was very disappointed with the acting of Chris Hemsworth in the role of the Norse God Thor. He is totally unsuitable to play the part. The best Thor I have seen, was Eric Allan Kramer who played the part in The Incredible Hulk Returns(1988).

Regulars Robert Downey Jr.(Iron Man), Chris Evans(Captain America), Scarlett Johansson(Black Widow), Mark Ruffalo(Hulk), Jeremy Renner(Hawkeye) perform their respective duties in their respective roles - but fail to shine. Newcomers Elizabeth Olsen(Scarlet Witch) and Aaron Taylor-Johnson(Quicksilver) make their debut appearance.

Don Cheadle, an Iron Man franchise regular, makes an appearance as War Machine. Anthony Mackie who is a versatile character that has appeared in Captain America: The Winter Soldier and the new Ant-man film.

Veteran actor James Spader(Jack's Back 1988, Stargate 1994, Dream Lover 1994, Critical Care 1997, The Watcher 2000(his best film simply unmissable)) plays the titular character Ultron. He does full justice to his characterization of Ultron, as a single-minded progenitor of mankind's annihilation.

Thank you for reading my review. Live long, prosper.",5
Ruined the Hulk...,26 March 2016,"The sad thing about this movie is that though it gets better every time you see it, one particular story element just keeps getting worse. Its when Tony Stark put on that iron fat suit and started throwing the Hulk around like he was made of styrofoam. There is not a true Incredible Hulk fan in the world that is not saddened and disappointed by this.

I used to look at Bruce Banner in this franchise with awe and reverence, now I just look at him with frustration and disillusionment. The idea of Bruce Banner and the Hulk used to mean something. When all else failed, it was what the story, the heroes in the story, and the fans watching the story could all depend on. Joss Whedon captured and delivered that beautifully in the first movie. Everything around the Hulk got its ass kicked by him in the first movie and he did not give a damn. This is the terrifying, and satisfying, essence of the Hulk.

But what Whedon and these money mongering jerks have done is ruined his character for the sake of marketability. Marketing the Hulk as some kind of half assed, green anger-clown to be made fun of and used to create suburban soccer mom-ish bullcrap out of his character is unforgivable. Next, he'll be wearing a tuxedo and holding a wine glass at his own wedding reception with Natasha Romanov. ALL credibility has been stripped from Whedon as a storyteller and from the Hulk's character, if he can be knocked out by a freakin' robot and hauled away in an airplane as Bruce Banner.

How the Hell can the Incredible Hulk go from knocking a building sized flying worm monster down with one punch in the first movie, then get knocked out by a robot his same size with one punch in the second movie? Until Whedon fixes this colossal mistake, this colossal bulls*t, in my opinion, his credibility is ready to be flushed down the nearest toilet. He is NOT the Hulk anymore. He's just some big, green clown that is hardly worth anything more than a yawn and a few laughs. Next, he'll be wearing an iron collar, chained to a leash in a traveling circus.

For what he did to the Incredible Hulk, Joss Whedon makes me sick to my stomach.",5
Disappointment. Once again it's an example of the sequel not living up to its predecessor,27 March 2016,"This film has everything you would expect from an action film. Lots of explosions, slow- motion scenes, fighting, good vs evil and the old pun to lighten things up. The quality of the film-making such as CGI is good but it should be for a movie with such a big budget. All the big stars give alright acting performances. However, I did not enjoy this film. It was a disappointment. I was irritated throughout by the poor Russia accents used by everyone who plays a Russia character. But the worst thing is the storyline. Boring and dare I say dull. It was also unnecessarily confusing. It is no where near as exciting or interesting as the first film, Avengers Assemble. I had this bought for me on DVD as a present and unfortunately, it will be sitting on my shelf gathering dust. Poor film that rests and relies on the success of the other Marvel films. If you want to watch a superhero movie, don't pick this one.",5

I thought it was alright but you need to watch the Avengers original in order to get the jest of it.,1 May 2015,,5
a surprising disappointment,2 June 2015,"I overall extremely disappointed with the quality of this movie. When I heard that Whedon was working harder to make this a better movie then the first Avengers movie, I became intrigued. When I saw the original trailer, I felt a piercing chill creep down my spine. I will say that I am a huge fan of Marvel and read the comics. It would be simple to pick on nearly any movie produced in the MCU simply due to the fact they veer so far off the comics (in relation to how character origins are portrayed).

Character development was lacking. It is unreasonable to expect them to create a movie full of main protagonists and delve into each of their perspectives individually. A background story can provide a solid plot and create a further understanding of the characters they are seeing on screen. Adding new characters can be beneficial, but focusing on their back story subtracts from the main plot too much. The primary focus should have been on Ultron. While Spader did a brilliant job voicing him, he had no depth. To put it simply, he was boring. I wanted his character to evoke some kind of emotion (happiness,anger, or both), yet I felt nothing.

The one part of the movie I truly found enjoyable was the scene where Iron Man faced Hulk. It had the appropriate amount and type of humor inserted into the script and the action was exciting to watch as well. Then again, This review might be a completely useless rant and waste of time considering I have yet to movie with the footage they cut out.",5
meh,7 May 2015,"Seen it all before except now there are so many ""main"" characters and heroes its hard to keep up. Of course the CGI, sound effects and visuals are amazing but you expect that in a big budget action movie these days. What is lacking is a story line and characters that you actually care about. Killer robot soldiers that can be scared off with a scowling look? Really? And why is every plot to destroy the world (yes, again, and why? Are we blocking someone's view?) taking more energy to set up the impending destruction than if the villain had just used that energy to actually destroy the world - I don't want to put in a spoiler so I'm being obtuse). Wasted scenes at a farmhouse and a dip in a magic pool for Thor that I still don't understand. Seriously, the writers need to actually read some old Marvel comics for some ideas on how to keep the reader/viewer interested. Yawn.",5

More of the same,2 June 2015,"Well, first I say that neither I nor detractor follower Los ¨ Vengers, but I've seen both films as mere amateur ¨ Some comics and superhero films in order to spend time entertainment and escape.

The first film, so exalted and deified ¨ can be said for most of the globe I found it an acceptable, entertaining film in perspective but quite cold and leaden in many cases, and superheroes, I confess, are not really saints my devotion, Thor, Iron Man, Captain America, Hulk etc .... I have always been other heroes and adults darker Batman, Spawn or Conan among others ..., so see the Avengers in feel much enthusiasm or feeling by its protagonists.

Analyze this film really is not very difficult as its premise, and development situations is almost identical to its predecessor. The same words, same performances caught by the hair, except to Downey Junior Achiever always a fun and refreshing and Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye, the rest as I said is correct and left in little more, and Samuel L.

Whedon address? Mediocre. I said and say again, this saga, because it will become a saga lose much with this useless manager, that manager has very, very little experience and trade. And it Wheddon is unable to provide true intensity and force the stories, the action scenes or performances, all are equally cold and pain in the ass than the previous, which is worth much fx and such, but again the same, not kill, not impressed, nothing, everything is already past the ending as you stay at first. Nothing memorable or do you plan to open the mouth! Wow that last! , Or joke. Epic failure, real emotion. Whedon does not work, and I hope they deviate to one side, but given the commercial success of both films, I see almost impossible.

The villain Ultron, it sucks. I find it pathetic, ridiculous and uninteresting, and the final battle as it was predictable, a succession of leaps, explosions, falls, blows, pithy phrases and graciosillas and little ... little more.

Certainly they give it a slightly darker tone than before, and in regard to rhythm, this is better off, being less lighter in his diálogos, which is appreciated, and after all entertain, entertaining, but that is the end all, not innovate or offer anything new, the script repeats the above schemes, misses a great epic and emotional level, the direction of Whedon still own a television film, taking away many points to the film, and Fx .. sí I repeat myself, I think I already know what he would say no?

As a sequel that's fine, as movie is better than the first, but we must find a director with real talent, give a more dark and violent film pitch, a script with more guts and not go to the topic and easy, and maybe it can be considered truly an awesome movie to the next installment.

"Not good, Not Bad",21 May 2015,"Better to go without any expectations and you might end up liking it.

For me this was a sequel to quite a wonderful movie called AVENGERS. the first part was quite a revelation as this was the first time I was seeing all the super heroes coming together and sharing screen. I am not a big fan of all the super hero movies but it is quite cool to see IRON MAN talking to THOR or HULK talking to Captain America.

But this movie was not great. It has some storyline of something getting stolen and something affecting the world .. blah blah.. as if we have not heard of it before. Although story was expected to be BAD, the acting and the play time disappoints more. How is it that the only entertainer in this movie is IRON MAN. Comon, we need more ... there are so many of them at least someone will have something better to say.

Grossly under utilized mark buffalo just seems to carry the burden of HULK and SULKs all the way till the end. the best thing about the first part was HULK and in this the worst thing is HULK. the black widow ( scarlet ) has been given enough time in this movie to actually suggest that this could have been a chick flick ( no offense ). She is hot but well I dint go to actually look at her and think oh god she is hot. But if I am thinking that then AVENGERs failed for me. the others are all inconsequential and really don't have much to do. There is so much introspection that the super heroes do in this movie that it is hard to imagine that these are actually super heroes who are not supposed to be behaving like commoners.

the only plus is the voice of the villain. the sarcasm in his voice takes the cake.

Sincere advice to the next AVENGERS director, GET HULK BACK.",5

The theme of Artificial intelligence has better been dealt in AI by Steven Spielberg and a very nice English film ""Ex-Machina"" by Alex Garland. Let us not speak of the acting capabilities of the actors.... Sack of potatoes, apples or carrots would have been better. As for directing it is non-existent , even the battle scenes are poorly executed the scenario was written by some alien from Mars (now that they have discovered water)directed to ignorant, dispossessed from any analytical skills human beings and let us talk about diversity.... hahahahahhahahahahaha, no LGBT , no native Americans, no Spanish, No Indians , no Arabs .....Finally, let us put aside the clichés... the best collection in a film",2

MCU mediocrity celebrated,28 July 2016,"When people rant about how bad Batman V Superman is, my rebuttal is asking them what made The Age of Ultron good in comparison to BvS and the room goes silent. This movie is painfully mediocre, it will not bore you to death, but it definitely isn't good or even near decent, it is just an average movie. The plot is nonsensical,the villain again comes off generic and the comedy bits are painfully corny. I mean Captain America says ""language"" after a team mate says a curse word; really?! Another thing that just pisses me off is the forced romance between black widow and the Hulk. What happened to Betty?! How is it that any woman now can calm down the Hulk because that instantly destroys the uniqueness of Betty's relationship with Banner. Seriously,WTF! This is what you guys defend as good comic-book movie?! I want to leave this goddamn planet!",5

The Avengers again!!!,28 April 2015,"This movie is a straight out commercial film without any serious plot and with a lot of one liner jokes. Seems like Marvel is ripping themselves, Age of Ultron is very similar to The Avengers and The Guardians of the Galaxy. The super hero team is divided in the starting only to unite by the end of the film to defeat the antagonist.

From the beginning of the movie we can see that the story will set the plot for the future Marvel movies Civil War, Avengers Infinity Wars part 1 and part 2.

The main antagonist Ultron doesn't seem like a serious guy. Even he has his one liners. I couldn't take Ultron seriously from the beginning of the movie except for his appearance. Ultron is supposed to be a really serious character, impossible to outsmart and difficult to beat.

The locations were really good and the graphics were superb. But the 3d was like any other film.

There was not much seriousness to the characters, all the director cared about was which character gets the last one liner. Iam not really sure why Captain America says ""language"", even after he fought in the world war, he got beaten up on the streets.

Overall I will not be expecting the future Avengers films to outdo this film.",4
SLOW START . . . Too much backstory in the beginning . . .,7 June 2015,"Okay . . . I must say that I could not stay and watch after the first 30 minutes of the movie . . . I, literally, started to ""drift off"" at least twice. I finally asked my sister if she was as bored with it as I was and she said that she had started to doze herself . . . and this is at a Matinée!! And . . . it was in 3D!!!

I did ask a couple of other people about it and they said that they had enjoyed it . . . I don't know if it gets any better . . . The people I talked to were guys . . . and they liked the fight scenes, which were good. I am just not that ""into fight scenes"" I need SUBSTANCE, story line.

So I am going to try and watch it again and see if it gets any better.",2
Somewhat Disappointing,9 October 2015,"The Avengers are at it again. What you ask? Why saving the world, of course. This time from Ultron (voice of James Spader) who also vows to destroy the Avengers because he consider them killers. Oh, oh! This can't be good. But wait, wasn't it Tony Stark (Downey Jr) who created Ultron? (yes, it was him)

Like the Fast & Furious movie, watch this for the CGI and stunts. Oh, and for Scarlett Johansson as Natasha/Black Widow, of course. All are spectacular. When you think the CGI can't get any better we are pleasantly surprised again. It just never ends. Kudos. However, there is a problem and the problem is this: as good as the CGI is, it just never ends and the movie is one big battle and it's gets to be quite tedious after a while. We drifted to la la land at times. Who writes this stuff?

There are some quiet moments that kind of help somewhat: we have Hawkeye (Renner) with his family at a safe-house with the other Avengers in a re-grouping mode; and we have Natasha now flirting with the Hulk (Ruffalo) (didn't she flirt with the other Avengers in previous movies?) Who writes this stuff?

But the thing that really bothered me was Ultron's lips when he spoke. They moved. Now Ultron is all metal and the lips moved like human lips. Not good. Who writes this stuff?

Humor was attempted by Spader as Ultron and that went nowhere. We were not amused. Who did the writing for this?

Then Thor (Hemsworth) brings in Vision (Paul Bettany) - also the voice of Jarvis, Stark's right hand man who is a computer - touted as the most powerful entity in the universe and yet the movie doesn't end with Vision beating Ultron as it should have. So much for being the most powerful entity in the Universe. Who writes this stuff?

Notables: Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury, Don Cheadle as James Rhodes/War Machine, Paul Bettany as Jarvis/Vision, Idris Elba as Heimdall, Andy Serkis as Ulysses Klaue, Stan Lee as who else but Stan Lee, Josh Brolin as Thanos, Lou Ferrigno as the voice of the Hulk. (he just grunts)

All in all not bad, but tedious at times and if there are sequels the writers need to be vetted. (5/10)

"Poor by comparison, but still fun to look at.",7 May 2015,"Messy movie. The first wasn't perfect, but it seemed polished and on-point, with a clear creative vision and a sensible story-arc. This one seemed very disjointed in its writing and even in its editing, particularly surrounding Scarlet Witch scenes and the various dream-sequences she inspires. It was oddly difficult to track the characters during fight-scenes, them seemingly warping all over the place with minimal continuity, especially toward the end. Ultron was a weak villain, his nonchalant attitude and all-too-human foibles/quirks seeming distinctly at odds with his motive. Also, obligatory 9/11 reference was obligatory, not to mention offencive and in extremely poor taste. Every superhero movie these days seems disturbingly obliged to include scenes in which terrified citizens run from advancing clouds of concrete-dust as seen on 9/11, but this one went one step further by actually collapsing a skyscraper in the 'pancake' method to get that result.",4
Reminds me of Transformers,2 May 2015,"I honestly just walked out of the theater with my wife. She fell asleep for half of it. That sums up her review. My part of it, it reminds of Transformers, pick any of the 4 or 5 that are around. Its action, action, and more action, and really lacks a good plot. I though Michael Bay directed it honestly. There is one liners and that's it. Some romance, but really, how difficult would it be for it to have had a mildly interesting story. I understand they introduced new avengers, but frankly it was a snooze fest. I would wait for it on Redbox. Its not worth the price of admission.

The only positive from this film I though was Aaron Taylor Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen respectfully as Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch. They were fantastic.",5
A filler episode in a TV series,10 May 2015,"I understand that many people have liked this movie. And I don't want to say whether it was good or bad, so I will just point out why I personally didn't like it... even though it may be a good movie.

the movie is of course geared towards kids. So it is full of corny dialogue and action scenes that are totally unnecessary.


i won't use examples for the sake of not spoiling anything, but basically an event would take place just so that the writers can force another event to result from it. Simply put, it's not so much a kid would text while driving, which results in him getting into an accident... but rather it's like, okay this kid needs to get into an accident, so let's just have him text and drive. So some parts felt forced rather than natural. And it made some scenes feel unnecessary.


-it's not a good story. I know it's just suppose to be a fun movie, and I'm sorry for taking it a bit seriously (and keep in mind I'm still a huge Dark Knight fan), but I was just so disappointed by how poor the story was. I personally liked the story for Captain America: Winter Soldier, and I know it's hard to have a good story with so many superheroes in it (even though X-Men pulled it off brilliantly), but there seemed to be a lack of effort when it came to the quality of the story.



-i hate to say it, but it was basically the same as the first movie. Even some of the dialogue was very similar to the first movie, about how they should all unite and be a team. It just felt repetitive. I didn't feel like i was watching a new Avengers movie at all.",5

Instead they should have bring Galactus,Thanos or something out of space villain,this robot thing is beyond able to watch again.Director should not have made this movie,i will never watch AOU again,my recommendation was not liked by my few friends who said this are same Hollywood boring style movies,why. Even human looking Loki has good presence value than this kid Ultron.",5
good effects terrible story.,14 December 2015,"a quarter of a billion dollars to make,almost 2.5hrs long....for this?

Story goes Stark & Banner try to make a program to protect mankind, but cant. but then while they are out having a drink it magically happens by itself (never explained how).. It then becomes self aware (like Skynet) & decides to wipe out humanity (again never explained why) & goes to live in the internet (maybe while there it watched Thor or two girls one cup & decided to end us), magically making armies of Iron men-a-likes from who knows where (again no one explains why there's iron man factories all over the world to borrow). He keeps turning up now & then & the avengers keep killing them & him. though the avengers also destroy pretty much all the buildings in the various cities they turn up in (bit like team America) but also spend all their time trying to save all the humans in said cities as well (which becomes unintentionally hilarious considering the destruction the Avengers cause) well, that's the story....if you think that'll keep you engaged for nearly 2.5hrs you might enjoy it. the computer graphic effects are generally very good , 3D isn't great.",2

An Unbalanced Tease,30 May 2015,"The Avengers was well-balanced and fun. It was a well-written superhero buddy comedy. The action was over-the-top but worked to enhance the laughs. It didn't take itself too seriously, which was welcomed at the time. Since, we have had a 3rd Iron Man film that sucked all the fun out of the Tony Stark character. A 2nd Thor film that was actually quite exciting and full of surprises, especially compared to the first, which was like a romantic TV sitcom. And we've had not only one of the greatest sequels of all time, but also one of the best action films in over a decade, Captain America: The Winter Solider. So to write there was a lot of hype for Avengers 2 would be an obvious understatement.

Age of Ultron is so unbalanced in so many ways, it's hard to know where to begin. The film is successful in a few areas. It does a great job of making us fear what Ultron is capable of. While Loki was charming and mischievous, Ultron is frightening. What's disappointing is that in a film called Age of Ultron, Ultron is not given enough screen time. The best scene has the Avengers taking turns trying to pick up Thor's hammer. Unfortunately, this scene was already revealed in the trailers and the actual film doesn't offer anything better. The most interesting aspect of the film, visually, are haunting visions given to the characters thanks to Scarlet Witch. This causes Thor to go off on a side quest, which is much more mysterious and interesting than what we are left watching. It also causes the much anticipated Hulk vs. Hulkbuster scene, which is played for laughs and is over much too quickly. It's all downhill from there.

Age of Ultron is at it's best when it's being horrific and when it's revealing it's heart, which in the film's biggest surprise, lies with Hawkeye. We are introduced to some new characters that we are never given much reason to care about. Other than Scarlet Witch giving the Avengers their visions, both her and Quicksilver seem like pointless, lazy additions that take up screen time that could have been better spent with the characters we paid to see. What's worse is the time wasted on an out-of-place and unfitting love story that develops between Black Widow and Bruce Banner. It's so forced and unnecessary, it actually causes us to loose interest in their characters. Hulk no longer has the impact he once made. Tony Stark has long lost what made him such an exciting character and this film doesn't do anything to make us excited to see him again. Hawkeye is the only one we are given reason to care whether he lives or dies. In the final act, we are introduced to yet another new character that is so poorly executed, it makes us glad this is the last Marvel film Joss Whedon will be directing.

In The Winter Solider, the intensity of the action scenes was taken to a whole new level. The comedy stayed in the interactions between the characters while the plot and action seemed like a very serious threat for once, keeping us on the edge of our seats. Avengers: Age of Ultron takes place shortly after the events of The Winter Solider, yet it's a step back into light, silly cartoon action where there's no real feeling of danger. As threatening as Ultron is, we never worry that one of the Avengers might actually die. And even if they did, we know they won't stay dead.

Between what James Gunn did with Guardians of the Galaxy and the Russo brothers with Winter Solider, the stakes were raised too high for the over-confident, under-talented Joss Whedon. Age of Ultron gets too close to a Michael Bay film with so many failed attempt at humor, tension and surprise.",4
WALT Disney has destroyed MARVEL's characters!,5 May 2015,,1
Too much of anything is good for nothing,24 April 2015,"If I have to rephrase this: ""Too many cooks spoil the broth"" then it will be something like this ""Too many superheroes will spoil the action movie"". I came to this conclusion after watching this movie.

I got headache after viewing this movie. In I,Robot and Terminator, we have Artificial Intelligence (A.I) as the villain. Same goes here as well but one distinction is we have another A.I ""Vision"" as an Avenger. One can understand the story from trailer itself. Villain ""Ultron"" believes Humans are dangerous to the world peace and therefore from their extinction world peace is possible. He then enacts a plan to kill all Humans, only to be stopped by Avengers. Such a wafer thin plot is stretched to almost two and half hours by including action sequences and lame background of the Superheroes.

Why I didn't liked this movie? May be I have grown up questioning myself more about who I am? What is the reason for my existence?... etc.

This movie is for those who don't question and accept things as they are.",5
A fun popcorn sequel... Not much else,7 October 2015,"""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" (2015) is one of the many newer sequels to the ever growing Marvel Cinematic Universe. Marvel has it's hands full with building this cinematic universe, especially after last years critical and commercial hits ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" (2014) and the surprise summer smash ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" (2014). After those two films and the seeing the dark trailers for ""Age of Ultron,"" I was expecting Marvel to bring something very exciting and new to the table.

Unfortunately, Marvel stuck to their easy formula which is to make an almost identical movie to ""The Avengers"" (2012) and past Marvel entries. The trailers which promised a darker take on the film and villain did their job to fill in the seats, but sadly it didn't deliver on its marketing.

The main problem with this sequel is the villain, Ultron (voiced by James Spader). While James does an excellent job sounding menacing, the writers do a poor job of making Ultron's actions just as evil and creepy. Most of Ultron's lines are meant to make the audience laugh (I hardly smirked), and there is one scene where Ultron commits a scary action but then undermines his villainy with an apology. If good superhero films have taught us anything, it is that a good villain makes the hero. Ultron sadly feels like he could have been any other villain and he still wouldn't be memorable.

The second problem for ""Age of Ultron"" is that our heroes have no threat to worry about. Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Captain America (Chris Evans), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), and the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), have nothing to fear. Ultron doesn't scare them and the heroes seem to act like he is just another easy threat.

I wish I could say ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" is unpredictable or does something extremely new and exciting, but it doesn't. It is by far the most predictable entry in the series, which may be a good thing since it is only meant to be a mindless summer blockbuster.

In the end it's up to the audience member to decide if they were entertained or not. While I prefer films that try something new, others may be happy knowing this is exactly what Marvel has been doing in the past. It is not a bad thing, but I'm worried it may get old fast if this trend continues.

My movie/T.V. recommendations:

If you liked it: ""The Avengers"" (2012), ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" (2014), ""Ant-man"" (2015), ""The Flash"" (2014-Present)

If you didn't like it: ""X-men: Days of Future Past"" (2014), ""The Dark Knight"" (2008), ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" (2014), ""Watchmen"" (2009)",5
Good for the wrong reasons,29 April 2015,"Joss Whedon promised us a ""darker"" sequel; did he succeed? It would appear yes, but that isn't necessarily a good thing.

What made Age of Ultron a ""must see"" for most is the simple fact that it comprises of characters we've had to watch in separate films. It was just the thrill of seeing Iron Man and Thor, two stars of their own individual films, meet up once again! This was the selling point for the first Avengers, and clearly it has succeeded again. However this may have been ""milked"" as there were clearly some characters that were there just for the sake of it, without any real need or purpose to serve the plot. This could have been time better spent explaining the events that took place between Age of Ultron and the previous Marvel films. The performance of Paul Bettany and James Spader as their Vision and Ultron were absolutely amazing, but not enough to justify the excessive final battle scenes.

After the first Avengers, the individual character story lines about the Hulk, Black Widow and Hawkeye seemed to compensate for the lack of character depth (seeing as the other Avengers all have their own movies). However, this I felt was again excessive. As a sequel, Age of Ultron avoids the (necessary) burden of having to spend the first half of a movie developing its characters. Without revealing too much, it seems that the movie jumps straight into the plot ""for the sake of it"", just because it can.

In summary : Good cameos, great additions to the cast, but poor development, cliché sideline stories and fight scenes that seem to have lost their charm. Not to mention unanswered questions between the two Avengers movies, as well as the other Phase 2 movies. And to make it matters worse, nothing more than a slightly anti-climatic mid-credit scene.",4
Marvel is fizzling out... boring boring boring movie.,25 August 2015,"The title says it all. This installment of marvel heroes must have been written by the Hulk... 1% brain and 99% brawn. Basically, if you saw the trailer, you do not need to see the movie. Its a basic action flick and the plot was clearly just a secondary thing thrown in to show off special effects and animation. I was never a fan of the Averngers or Iron Man but I could tolerate them because I love comics and fiction. The problem with this movie is that the AI is treated as dumb making the plot silly, while the Avengers waste half a movie mopping around because they cant get along. The dialog was OK but you need to be a hardcore fan of each character to not be bored to tears... I am not a huge fan and I really don't care for all the explosions and action unless there is a solid plot.",4

"Hollywood, stop! It is not a good idea to make superhero or action movies with astounding visual effects but a poor screenplay",13 October 2015,"The first part of the movie (12 minutes) is a quite good action flick. Then, the title ""Avengers"" appears and the film gets worse and worse. Indeed, the visual effects throughout the movie are amazingly well done, extremely realistic and numerous (three thousand of them!), and many people, particularly youngsters, think that this is the most important thing in a superhero film (then rejecting many nice movies which lack those amazing visual effects or that fast pace or that amount of explicit violence), but I strongly disagree: the story is always the most important element... and this one is poor! In my opinion, most of the time ""Avengers 2"" is a bit boring, there are many silly dialogs, lots of unfunny gags, and the black-green romance is cheesy, besides having no previous development (the chat about having or not a future together is specially pathetic). Talking about the good traits, Robert Downey Jr. was the best again. The scene in the train with Captain America and the twins was also nice, and so are some fights. Though, the film overall sucks. Is is a shame that Hollywood action movies are spending more and more in technology at expense of good screenplays. The films from the second phase of Marvel cinematic universe (this one, ""Thor: the dark world"" and ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" are awful, and I also include here ""Avengers 1"") are much worse (so poor stories! so focused only in visual effects!) than the ones made up to ""Captain America: The first Avenger"" (this one and ""Iron Man"" are particularly good).",5

How many time can you watch same plot with different one-liners?,8 May 2015,"Avengers 2 is same plot in a new movie. It has the same moral of teamwork and same glowing object at its center which is part mystery and part plot-convenience. But of course that's not important because avenger movies are about some awesome fight scenes. The same kind of scenes for which we abhor Michael Bay movies. But if you ask me I can't tell who's director when a giant person fights another giant person in the middle of the city and crush it into rubble . No matter if its color is green or metallic red. I was kind of done with destruction porn somewhere between Man of Steel and watching it again makes me cringe. The single good thing was addition of new superheroes whose powers looked cool for first few use.

If we leave that part aside there is noting to say much. A ""meh"" love story buildup. A simple plot which tries to be complex by hiding behind technicality. Some OK one-liners, that can make you chuckle (they had no power on me) And that's about it.

Superheroes?,1 May 2019,"I'm old school. Superheroes movies are supposed to be fun and the superheroes themselves should be morally upright. They should stand for that old cliche - truth, justice, and the.... well that covers it well enough.

We are already beginning to see the moral ambiguity of Captain America: Civil War. Stark is not a good person. The end justifies the means for him and. I question if there is any line he wouldn't cross. Most of the other Avengers are not quite as ambiguous, but they cover a spectrum from Captain America at the one end to Stark.

The movie itself is all about ruthless destruction which inevitably leads to massive cold-blooded deaths. A few of the deaths are heartbreaking to the viewer, but why aren't they all heartbreaking.

Governments in the Marvel universe now begin to see that the Avengers are often as dangerous to civilians as the villains they oppose.

The fight scenes and camera work are terrible, the movie has so many quick cuts and is so horrifically edited, and they did a really bad job with Quicksilver, he had like 25 minutes of screen time and then they just killed him.

The villain is absolutely terrifying and a top 10 MCU villain for sure, but this movie doesn't feel like a sequel, it doesn't feel like an Avengers movie, a sequel is supposed to continue the storyline of the first one but this film has nothing to do with it.

It's also not funny, there's like one moment where I laughed and why does it start in the middle of a fight scene?

They also didn't do a great job introducing Klaue, who will be important later on and there's no explanation for why Iron Man had time to build Ultron.

It's the Avengers and it showed up the same way I expected, we can clearly see the distaste of the filmmaker when it comes to successfully injection action into the movie with out disappointing one of the super hero fans and to make audiences to come to the vacuum they trim tried to fit another two characters which left hulk and iron man to get Least part to play which may disappoint the fans of those two and trying to make sure of utilizing the time for each character is rather underwhelming so it's Quite not an interesting plot and the same old punch lines as you might have expected and a bit crowded by the superheroes leaving them little less time to even establish or connect through the fans",5
"avengers get a pass with averagers, ultron was far from ultra",30 April 2015,"the main avengers, cap, iron man, hulk, thor...etc are their usual selves, couple of jokes here and there, plenty of action, and carry the movie but its kinda same ol same ol and getting kinda boring.

Vision looks awful, and im pretty sure ultron was a reject design of how they intended Megatron to look like in the transformer franchise. He's way to chatty and sarcastic. huge disappointment.

must see? not at all.

worth paying to see? I guess you could spend on inferior movies.

all in all I suppose the introduction of a few characters and continuation of the infinity stone story was necessary, but the movies aren't doing anything new really so for me id rather Marvel get back to focusing on spider-man and the sinister six saga.",5
"Fun, but forgettable",26 April 2015,"Age of Ultron, I'm fairly sure, is exactly whatever you're expecting it to be. If you're a fan of the humour and the first Avengers in particular, you'll of course love this one as much, if not more. However, if you're like me and weren't sold on the first one, then you're probably in for more of the same. AOU promises a darker tone, The Empire Strikes Back of the eventual Avengers quadrilogy if you will. Despite this, the film lacks any suspense given that we know our superhero pals will be coursing back onto our screens for their next dozen blockbusters over the next few years. Not to mention the more dramatic tone, or lack thereof, as every scene feels inconsequential, with the Avengers playfully joking about as we wait for the next fight; fights which should spell danger and anxiety for them. additionally, sub-plots are picked up and never expanded upon. Why is Nick Fury suddenly popping up in the middle of the film, offering nothing plot or character wise? Why did Black Widow flirt with Bruce once at the start of the film only for the next time we see them together for them to be in a relationship? The film was originally 3 hours+, and it's blatant that important, character developing scenes have been cut out (that being said, if you're willing to wait I'd guarantee the director's cut of the film to be more satisfying). ultron is a menacing and worthy foe to the Avengers, and his screen presence is fantastic, however his motivations seem shaky at best and his intentions to cleanse the world seem weak, considering the story revolves around his might. despite these flaws, Age of ultron is a good film and a worthy sequel to The Avengers. It's more of the same, but in a good way. The action scenes are of course amazing and breathtaking at times, if a little suspense-less. The scenes with Quiksilver are brilliant, and overall some of the set pieces in the film are a wonder to behold, especially the opening tracking shot of all the Avengers together. Overall, this film is good, not great, as with so many Marvel movies as of late. Go and see it, it'll entertain you. Just don't expect ""The Empire Strikes Back"" of the MCU.",5
Mediocre at best,23 September 2015,,5
big hype for a big let down,7 May 2015,,5
'Meh',25 March 2016,"Marvel sometimes surprises me with their films some of them are Amazingly Great(The Avengers,Winter Soldier,Ant-Man,Guardians Of The Galaxy,Iron Man And Thor) and some generic(The Incredible Hulk,The Dark World,Iron Man 3,Iron Man 2 and The First Avenger) and where does this film falls.Generic.I mean this film is generic.

To be honest I was really excited to see the Avengers again in the big screen.I was so hype that time and I got more excited after I watched the trailer that ""Hydra"" Leaked it.And after all of that.I was really disappointed of this film.You want to know why?

Let's start with the good,The film has a great cast and they have great chemistry,no surprises their.The special effects are good but some of it are just too CGI.I give credits cause the characters are relevant and not out of place.

What's bad about the film? The villain is generic as hell.I thought he was a menace and I was afraid of him but when I saw him in the film he is just like any other generic villain in this universe.The action is 'meh'cause i felt like I've seen this before(Avengers) and Like i said Too CGI. The story is the same as the first avenger(2012) movie but with even more subplots.The film is fast,I mean the film doesn't have time to breathe and the next time you look at the screen they are now fighting ultron.

Avengers 2 is mediocre.That's the summary.",5
Stick with the first film.,3 February 2016,"I liked the first Avengers. It was fun, had a whole load of action and some good acting, a decent story and such forth. However, after watching Age of Ultron for the first time yesterday, I can safely say it's not as good. No. I'm not gonna hold this back to the end, actually. It isn't very good at all. Maybe that's why everyone's forgotten about?

Following on, sort of, from Captain America: Winter Soldier and the first Avengers, you're thrown straight into the action, where the Avengers duke it out with what remains of Hydra, to snatch the sceptre – you know, the one Loki used in the first film. Nonetheless, there isn't really much fighting back, and the Avengers easily take the sceptre after a relatively boring action sequence, which both goes on for too long and is so easy for the Avengers that it's not actually that easy to watch. It's not silly action. It's not very exciting, it's just watching the Avengers beating up some goons, in a repetitive manner. The underwhelming action along with a substandard script, flat acting and total lack of atmosphere or inventive cinematography makes for an uninspiring first 20 or so minutes.

However, the intro for the first Avengers film wasn't all that much better, so I guess it got better then?  Eventually, I guess.

Well, the script didn't change, for one thing. Filled with brilliant things ranging from rubbish one-liners (not fun, Scharzenegger one- liners, that is; just Tony Stark annoying one-liners) to bad comedy. The story, on the other hand, isn't anything special either. Actually, it's a bit crap. Stuff blows up, they have a party, then some annoying robot guy turns up. Then everything goes a bit pair- shaped, and — oh! Did I ever mention the twins? They suck ass. I mean, they properly suck ass. Portrayed by Elizabeth Olsen and good ol' Aaron Taylor Johnson (the stars of Godzilla!), are the twins who I didn't care about. Vaguely European, they put on terrible accents and act without any expression or personality whatsoever. Sure, they have pretty cool powers, but that doesn't mean they're good characters. They ruin the film, no less. They just complicate things and make the film longer than it needed to be. Furthermore, the girl, whatever her name is, she does this telepathic stuff. It doesn't lead to anything other than a stupid fight between Iron Man and Hulk, which I didn't care about. I was thinking for a lot it: ""Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!"" Tony Stark, that is.

The film's length is a big issue, actually. What little content they had, they decided to stretch it out to over 2 hours. Simply put, over 2 hours is too long for a super hero film. They're all about silly action and cool characters, not soppiness and too much talking. The length and lack of substantial content for it makes for dragging out of scenes that weren't that interesting anyway, and, frankly, a first hour that's a bit boring — reminded of Godzilla, anyone? In some ways, I think this film is worse than Godzilla. Wait! I was supposed to leave that till the end! Oh well. Anywho, there's also way too much linking to the Marvel universe, with the telepathic twin at fault again. I don't want Thor walking around saying stuff, whilst ripping his shirt off in Thor, so I definitely don't want it in Avengers. None of the side plots added anything. Especially Tony Stark and Hulk's stupid fight.

Back to the acting. Robert Downey Junior. Eh. Didn't have much of a script to work on. I think his Iron Man is wearing thin, though, anyway. Scarlett Johansonn. The same as ever. Chris Hemsworth. Not helped by the script at all, his Thor isn't a friend with bad jokes. For some reason they decided for him to get involved in them. Alright. I'm gonna stop now. There isn't a special performance anywhere in this, and though the cast is the victim of a substandard screenplay, they don't do a good job of making the most of what they've got, as most of the performances are bland and without any change for the better from past performances — though Chris Evans is decent as Captain America, as per usual.

I haven't actually said anything positive yet, really. Well, maybe it's not quite as bad as you might have interpreted so far. Sure, the first hour is, but as the film gets further the action and entertainment gets a lot better, and the plot kicks in as there's actually some great action, in an exciting climax. It's great fun, and the score kicks in as well, so there's finally some atmosphere. The last 50 minutes or so are good, actually, as all the pointless talking and soppiness has more or less ended, the film finally finds a faster pace. Nevertheless, it's not all that good, as you may have guessed.

Verdict:

Uninspired on every level, Avengers: Age of Ultron, until the 1:20 mark, is rubbish. The last 50 minutes are quite a lot better, though, with great action and excitement on display. Nonetheless, the flaws found all over the first hour 20 are still found in this portion of the film; ranging from a bad script, to an uninteresting story, ponderous acting and pointless branching to the wider Marvel universe — with the film's length far too long. It's not completely rubbish, but

Just stick with Avengers Assemble.

""In some ways, I think this film is worse than Godzilla.""

Totally Blasphemous,22 May 2015,,4
Exhausting,6 May 2015,"""Age of Ultron"" descends upon its audience, hitting the ground running with guns blazing. Makes sense; after all, ""in media res"" is probably the best way to start such a thing. But that action . . . it doesn't really stop. Just moves from one huge setpiece to the next, destroying city blocks (sometimes actual cities) in its wake. This movie is so intent on giving us non-stop action and introducing new characters and setting up MCU Phase 3 and pounding our senses that the subtle pieces of character from the first one are all but gone. The relationship between Bruce and Natasha was nice, and they did give Hawkeye some nice personality this time around, but that's about it. And Ultron was a lackluster bad guy, enhanced a bit by Darth Spader, but only just. There was just so much infrastructure here, so much to take in, that you just want some space to breathe. The pieces are all well-machined - a move here, a stunt there, new toys from from Tony Stark - but it's not as satisfying a whole.

It does its job at beating you about the face with CGI battle scenes, that much you can't even question. But if this is the MCU's trajectory, then . . . stop the ride, I want to get off.

Just a movie for children.,4 May 2015,"Nothing superb or extraordinary, it's just a superhero movie for children, generic plot, generic action, one line jokes all the movie. Don't expect to see another Wolverine, or Batman movie, or even the first Iron Man movie. Not a fan of this one.

Oh! one big problem that I have is: the action is too fast, they don't give you time to see anything at all, they throw too much CGI at you that they take it out of screen before you see the effects they use. There are some scenes that I would like to see at least 4 seconds, but no, 2-3 seconds and then the next shoot, or camera moves, or everything shakes!. No, they don't want you to notice something, and I think it's they use cheap CGI effects.",4

The Avengers Sequel is not up to mark.,26 April 2015,"One word, its a big yawn. Marvel lost all the steam by over doing umpteen sequels to all their superhero movies. Nothing new in the latest film whose prequel released in 2012 was a good entertainer. Overdoing the same sequences and stunts again and again is not enough to keep th audience interested. Thor-2 and Captain America WInter Soldier released last year chocked to stand on their feet meaningful sequels to their prequels. Those were the first signals that Marvel losing grip on their superhero sequels. Its big time Marvel to bring in some story-substance into their superhero films or just windup the franchise.",5
Start.Breakup.Makeup.Hulk Stops Bad Guy.Fight Army.Win.,27 April 2015,"Sounds kinda familiar doesn't it?

That doesn't mean its bad. Its just a bit disappointing. It was great cinema, enjoyed every second. But thats why it gets the 6 point rating.

->Good VFX? Check. ->Funny? Check. ->Nice memorable scenes? Check. -> Scarlett Johansson? Checkity Check Check.

->Awesome plot? Nope.

I wasn't hooked onto the story as much I was hooked on to Tony Starks sarcasm. There were no serious motives anywhere, or a point to the story much. Kind of uneven, and no real character development.

Remember how the first movie's ending fight scene gave everybody a really vital role to culminate into an ultimate win? This one didn't. Hell, the ending fight scene didn't even really need all the heroes of The Avengers much. Plus, their win was kinda weird as well.

WAT THE FRUCK WAS UP WITH NATASHA AND THE HULK? LIKE SERIOUSLY WUT?

The affection and lullaby stuff was nice, but really really out of the blue. There was no development towards this in any of the previous marvel movies.

Also, remember the end of the previous film of this installment? Where the question was whether or not the avengers were right for the world. This one didn't really provoke any development or thoughts.

As I mentioned above, great cinema, go and watch it, in 3D. They did everything. They just didn't go over the top like I had hoped they would.

Who wrote this script?,26 April 2015,,5
Marvel is tricking their fans..,3 May 2015,"Avengers:Age of Ultron brought in a lot of hype. Action packed figures, lot of TV Spots, leaks, and all stuff that made me think ""Oh, looks like this is gonna be great.""

Watched and felt like downloading an illegal print was way much better than spending money and watching this movie. There are moments of ""Wow"" and ""Lol"" and "" Oh No"". But that's not enough for a movie. If Marvel thinks that putting in some great VFX and graphics would make people like the movie,they are so wrong. Individual performances are to be appreciated. Especially Aaron Taylor Johnson,Elizabeth Olsen,Paul Bettany and last but not the least, James Spader. At a point you would believe that this movie is going to be so awesome.But then your expectations would fall off when you realize that you had been tricked by the amazingly created complex visual effects that would put powder in your eyes and stop you from going out of the theater.

The only scene that was outstanding was the unexpected arrival of a special character that would soon be playing a big part in the upcoming phase 3 of Marvel films. Looks like Joss Whedon needs to take rest because all his superhero films are becoming something of a similar candy wrapped in different wrappers.",5
All over the place,19 September 2023,"The real big thing that turns me off from superhero stuff and makes me not like being involved in it is this right here. With it's just all over the place and is just convoluted as all hell.

With that it has so much exposition and worldbuilding to unpack of the fictional world with things that has happened before, what is happening now with it and what's to come of it after, with it also having to develop so many characters and other things that it becomes really hard to follow and fully developed all of it.

That its full of inappropriate juvenile humor or moments and you see all kinds of tones, themes, ideas and fantasy creatures or elements you can think of appear in the same place and come totally out of nowhere.

How much of the stories and events that happens don't seem all that fully thought out with it seeming to be making it up as it goes along with it also seeming to be making up its own rules but only follows them when it conveniently works well at the moment.

And finally how everything that ever happens is frankly totally inconsequential. With that nothing has real lasting effect so it's like everything that happened didn't even matter.

That's something really every superhero movie or superhero stuff in general has problems with just nothing lasts ever and always returns back to where it started out.

Nobody ever really evolves and nothing ever really changes and nobody really ever dies or goes away to pursue something else

and if they do it's only very short and temporary for both change or death which is definitely not how it works IRL. Its just this endless loop of events happening over and over again.

You see what I mean when I say superhero stuff are so incredibly convoluted.

Course I don't blame anyone making this having a super hard time trying to make these movies easy to follow. Creating fiction is incredibly hard to do well and in a coherent manner but these are still issues.

And I'm gonna end with this thing that some might want to think about. There one thing all stories need and that is a ending.

We all would like a satisfying ending but it doesn't always happen but the story still gave an ending.

And this film series making one movie after another with no real plan to end makes the previous movie that made the next happen really not matter as much anymore cause its like its disposable and not special. And really even more proves the point of everything that happens in these movies being totally inconsequential.

Makes it really hard to care and be invested in something unwilling to take risks and just having no definite conclusion.

There's only so many times you can do something until it gets stale and redundant.",5
Avengers: Age of Ultron,3 August 2020,"Avengers: Age of Ultron, directed by Joss Whedon, was surprisingly underwhelming. With all the hype around this film, Joss Whedon did his best to give us a great sequel to Marvel's: Avengers, with some solid character moments and ideas, but this essentially felt like a rushed out, second part of the first installment, while also creating so much exposition for what's to come. It sucks that this film has such a huge play in the overall concept of the saga because, it's massively overstuffed with messy subplots, and underdeveloped characters. The pacing of the film was very choppy, due to the extended amount of content that was cut in the editing room. The way each scene tied into eachother, felt real lose, and you can sense that they cut out some key moments that could've pieced together their scenes better.

With this being more of a story-driven narrative, I needed more than just another premise we've seen before. Whedon and the creative team incorporated too much filler, and because of that, you start to feel the run time as the film progresses. Whedon tried to weave in the same tones as the first film, but due to everything being botched together, the tones didn't flow nearly as good as the first installment. The way Whedon and the team structured this film, they set themselves up to be nit picked all day long, with one of the biggest comic book type films the MCU has put out. They tried to involve more stakes, but there wasn't too much of a wow factor.

You come to these films to grow with these characters, and to enjoy their chemisty, mixed with their banter, and you get that here, but there wasn't too much focus or development with any of out main avengers, besides Hawkeye. Whedon and the team dropped the ball this time with balancing the characters. In the first installment, everyone had a purpose, and fulfilled it to almost every level; here, they are all doing their own things, setting up for what's to come in the next phase of the MCU, instead of keeping this narrative as tight as possible, while subtly setting things up. Robert Downey Jr. still puts on a fantastic performance as Tony Stark/Iron Man, continuing to get good layers, but his character arch is a mixed bag. He's such a great character for his wits, and leadership skills, but he starts to become more and more arrogant, and independent. Chris Evans continues his admirable performance as Steve Rogers/Captain America, while starting to get comfortable with taking charge, brewing up great development between Tony and himself. Chris Hemsworth is all over the place in this film. Strangely, he felt shadowed at times when everyone was together, other than his developing bond with Captain America, but when he had his character moments, it was strictly exposition. Mark Ruffalo returns as Bruce Banner/Hulk, and his character arch ran the same lines as Thor. They start to develop Banner's relationship with Romanoff, and I'm 50/50 with the concept. It's a good grounding for Hulk, but then it just gives Scarlett Johansson another reason to be a flirt. One of the best things about this film, was Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye. We finally get more background on him, after three films, and I welcomed that with open arms; He's just a likable character! He has this great humanized aspect, that helps create a nice bond with the audience. Another intelligent, and entertaining addition to the film was Paul Bettany as Vision! For starters, his practical look was amazing! Bettany brings this tremendous wit to the character, while easily being one of the strongest! My only issue with the character, I just wish we got a little more on him, and from him. Aaron Taylor-Johnson as QuickSilver was fine, with some decent potential, but he was almost illegally underdeveloped. I enjoyed the addition of Elizabeth Olsen as Wanda more, being more entertaining, and a lot more powerful, but just like QuickSilver, she was underdeveloped as well. I tried really hard to like James Spader as Ultron, but I just couldn't do it. I appreciate that Whedon and the team tried to make him outside of the box, with a clever back story approach, but with his character being poorly written, with an unoriginal motive, he was just wasted potential as a villain. You can tell Spader had his fun with the character, but he didn't bring a whole lot of tention to any scenes that he was in, being pretty dimwitted, and underdeveloped.

The screenplay had it's moments of success, but because of the premise being overcrowded, nothing was able to flow together all that well. Joss Whedon upped the dosage of cheesy jokes, and just like the writting, the jokes were hit and miss.

The action is one of the standouts of the film. With it being handled by Joss Whedon, you know it's going to be well shot, high octane, and big fun! I would go as far as saying that, some of the action in this film, was handled better than the first installment.

Overall, I don't hate Age of Ultron, it's actually one of those films I don't mind revisiting, but because it doesn't age the best, with expositions here, there, and everywhere, I can't put Age of Ultron at the top of my MCU list.",5

"Succeeds as an action/sci-fi movie, but doesn't as an avengers movie.",24 February 2020,"The Avengers was a massive success, at the time, it was marvel's most successful movie, but it's predecessor is not worthy of being an avengers film.

Like the 1st avengers film, all of these avengers are fantastic with the material they were given and the chemistry between is great. The comedy was pretty good, except for a certain something they did with the comedy in this film. The action in this movie was very good, I had a really fun time with it.

Now the cons, I wanted ultron to be good, since the trailers showed us that he could be one of the best villains in film in history, well in my words, however I was wrong, what they did with Ultron is insulting to the character and its fans, Ultron was used as comedic relief, it didn't even look like they even tried to make him an actual villain, he was not menacing, he had no motivation, he was just really a bland and flat out boring character. Personally I am not a fan of the story, to me the story is just forgettable. There were times in this movie where certain parts were just thrown in there.

Conclusion: Age of Ultron is an entertaining movie, but it falls a part when it comes to Ultron, choices in the movie, and the story. As an action or Sci Fi movie, it's good. But as a marvel movie, it barely succeeds.",5

And the movie ultimately becomes too crowded with characters or superheroes that is with too many subplots and loses Focus.yes there were a few interesting scenes and action sequences that would catch your attention and the performance of Elizabeth Olsen who plays Scarlett Witch is worth mentioning.

the movie is indeed entertaining and worth a watch if you have a lot of free time and nothing to do on a Weekend. however Age of Ultron Pales in Comparison to the Cultutral Phenomenon that the was the first Avengers.

Critic Avengers,14 October 2015,,5
A great start to the summer movie season,25 April 2015,"Ultron: ""There are no strings on me!"".

The story to The Avengers: Age of Ultron is about Tony Stark jumpstarts a dormant peacekeeping program, things go awry and Earth's Mightiest Heroes, including Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, The Incredible Hulk, Black Widow and Hawkeye, are put to the ultimate test as they battle to save the planet from destruction at the hands of the villainous Ultron.

You had no idea how excited I was for Age of Ultron even after the chilling and dark looking teaser trailer we got back in October last year. The teaser trailer looked really dark and so dead serious and I know that's a thing with Marvel films today that they making they own films look dark and gritty but it's comedy, I have no idea why they do that but anywhere I was hooked. The villain Ultron was another reason for me to get excited for the movie as ""There are no strings on me"", thing I never thought it would be so creepy. After seeing the movie I can say that Age of Ultron is a great start to summer movies and a lot of fun to watch.

Joss Whedon had spoken out saying ""This was the hardest movie he ever worked on"", and I clearly see the effort and hard work put into this movie. Joss had a lot of things in his hands while making this movie and that's it's characters, story, action and it's brilliant sense of humor, and it payed off well. Joss Whedon did a great job directing this movie as he put in enough energy and to entertain everyone.

James Spader as the villain Ultron is pretty much what I already expected for the most part but these a lot of surprises to his character like his sense of humor and how self aware he is about everything around him and I think it worked and fitted him very well. James Spader pretty much dose Raymond 'Red' Reddington from The Blacklist and I'm not saying that in a negative way but more of a good thing. Marvel isn't doing such a great job with villains and I'm not talking about Loki I mean in Thor: The Dark World, Iron Man 2 and Guardians of the Galaxy all have weak villains but Ultron was awesome and I'm happy his character wasn't like the other villains in those three movies I just named. Great work James Spader.

The visual effect's were pretty damn good, the Avengers themselves are once again brilliant as we remember them.

Now for problems: Black Widow and Bruce Banner or Hulk have a love triangle in this movie and it really doesn't work at all. They chemistry wasn't there and there was no build up to it, I would like to see Captain American or Haweye have relationship with her as she as better chemistry with those two, it would have made more sense since she's been with Captain America and Haweye more times than Banner.

I feel that the movie didn't really set up the Civil War story in the next Marvel movie with Iron Man and Captain America against each other. I know a couple of times those two would get into a little fight but they quickly shake it off and moved on, it's a small little nick pick I have and I know it wouldn't effect everyone else but I just saying the Civil War story should have been set up a little bit.

Overall The Avengers: Age of Ultron is a great start to the summer movie season. I had a great time watching this movie, I never got bored, all the characters had they screen time and it was funny and entertaining, the villain I thought was great and the action scenes was very enjoyable.",5
I watched it at home and put in earplugs so I didn't have to listen to it anymore,15 September 2015,"If I had been at the cinema I would have walked out. I hated it. I don't even know what it was about because I could not watch more than 5 minutes without being too bored to pay attention. I haven't disliked a movie so much since Hulk with Eric Bana. It started with a mystifying and unexplained battle and it just went down from there. I got bored right from the beginning and after 20 minutes I put in my noise canceling earphones to block out this rubbish noise. I still have no idea what it was about and I still don't care. Worst movie ever...Hated it hated it hated it. ugh...I want my time back. And I am really perplexed at how this has such a high rating. I have read 5 pages of ratings to see if maybe it's just me that doesn't like it, but the first 5 pages are nearly all 1 and 2 star ratings. I don't get it.",1
this is Marvel's answer to the never ending runway,28 April 2015,"First of this is actually a fun movie to watch!!

From the start of the film we get thrown into amazing battles and catchy dialog. There is a big joke every 5 Min's or so, there are actions scenes that equate to nearly half of the film. The CGI for most part is awesome. Although Ultron could have been done better. But this movie lacks logic, reasoning and reality. The suspense of disbelief is non-existent. And yes I know that this is a Marvel Superhero movie, but that didn't stop the first Iron man, Thor, Captain America to be made within our world.

I don't want to spoil anything for any one, so to put it bluntly if you enjoyed films like Transformers, Pacific Rim, Fast and Furious then you will love this.

I gave this film 5/10 because we can no longer give a free pass to film, just because that film doesn't take it seriously, Just because a movie can make fun of its self, doesn't mean that it is a good movie. Compare this to Goodfellas, Godfather, Lord of the Rings, Shawshank or even all the way down the list of Iron Man 1, this movie doesn't equal them",5

All Germans are evil Nazis,20 September 2015,Really? The same old story of all Germans being evil Nazis? I think the people making these films need to take a closer look at the demographics of the American population and reconsider the same old story of hatred for the Germans over a war that war was 75 years ago. I'm part Jewish and am still getting sick of Hollywood spinning hatred about something they can't get over instead of sending a message of unity and humanity trying to get along with each other going forward. Using Hollywood to try and brainwash people into enough hatred to start another war just isn't going to happen. This has gotten ridiculous. I'm sick of the hate. Get over it.,1

I was pretty disappointed,4 May 2015,"As a long time marvel fan I went into the theater excited and walked out thinking ""what happened"",Anyway let me explain why First of all there was a lack of a plot (Ultron wants to destroy everyone OH NO!) they could have had a plot that stuck to the comic books a little more loosely but NO! this is a movie we just want your money because you love marvel and just can't resist our movies secondly do we really need a love interest? C'mon do we really give a rats ass about who has the hots for who? NO! we want some goddamn action! also do we really need all of the jokes,I swear they removed all of the plot with jokes and an over abundance of characters did we need all of the characters it had in it? we also know little to none about Ultron THE MAIN ENEMY! I just know mindless numbskulls will go see this and not even care about the comics with the excuse of ""Its 2015 who needs the comics?"" anyway this film was a let down that could have been a a great movie with an even higher box office cash in I can not believe they decided to make this it was the biggest marvel let down since Iron Man 2 for me honestly.",5

Expensive special effects B-movie,17 September 2015,"Why spend money on watching the Avengers: Age of Ultron? It's a completely unoriginal story, a waste of time and a total rip-off from Transformers, Iron Man and the first Avengers movie. The action scenes happens way too fast and often, an obvious attempt to cover up a week screenplay. Sad to say it also mocks people standing up for clean language – Captain America's famous line ""Language!"" kept getting a lot of heat from the obnoxious Iron Man. Speaking of Iron Man, they might as well have called this movie Iron Man 4 – it's all about him and his major blunder of creating artificial intelligence – apparently there are not enough villains in the world, so let's invent our own. If you're looking for an awesome sequel with same integrity (clean language) then Avengers: Age of Ultron is not for you. Just watch the first Avengers movie again, or Captain America 1 and 2 – the action is basically the same.",1
Worst film ever.,9 December 2020,"This film was so bad. I felt like washing my tongue with fairy liquid to clean my tongue from ever even saying the name of this movie. It was the worst film I had ever seen next to Twilight, absolute abysmal. The worst of the worst films it was so abysmal that one would even consider watching a film rated 0.5 out of 10. The overall development of the villain in the film was underwhelming. No real build up and no nothing. Throw it into the deepest part of a black hole. If you liked it then throw yourself there with the film. A poor follow up from the acclaimed Avengers film. Absolutely pathetic. A sadistic piece of monstrosity the likes of which will never be seen again. Of there was half a star I would do it. However there isn't. Unfortunately this garbage leads to some of the best films of all time. So you kinda have to watch it. It's like having a husband/wife who doesn't do anything but you are kinda messed because you said yes on the marriage day. So you kinda have to stick with them. Treat this vomit the same. A mandatory nonsense that you kinda have to watch.",1

This one is full of pseudo-talent. The direction, the acting and just about everything lacks quality. A disrespect to the viewer considering the hype surrounding it and the money it made. Add to the mix the fairly decent rating it has been awarded, and one starts questioning the sanity of his world.:-). This one surely differentiates the real from fake.

I didn't want to extend its viewing time any longer than necessary. I found Avengers: Age of Ultron tedious and boring.",3

Lots of great qualities but not a great film,5 March 2022,"As often with a famous franchise, there's good films and there's bad films. This one just isnt very good. The special effects are great, the acting is mostly good and the director had some fine ideas. Cinematography is good although obviously mostly CGI. Sound design is cool so why the bad score? All these things just can't make up for this boring convoluded yet extremely clichéd plot. It lacks the fun of the previous avengers films and the pacing could be better as well.

All in all, Its technically a great film, however, it's not a fun ride unless you turn your brain completely off - which should never be a demand for seeing a movie. It's a shame really; I love superhero films but some are good and some are just painfully overhyped by fanboys... and that's coming from a fanboy.

Why all the men in this movie are wearing training suits?,6 February 2024,"Why all the men in this movie are wearing training suits?

Starting with Captain America, The twin guy, Stark, the archer, even Black Widow... What is in this, yeah, we see they are built, what about something more stylish and classy?

Movie was kind filler to the series, world ran out of bad guys so we got aliens. Aliens ran scared so now we have evil intellect came out of Loki scepter. What is next, evil puppies? Evil gold fishes?

I am disappointed. Too unrealistic movie even for fantasy one.

At first scenes we see Avengers fighting, we literally see fifty kilos woman, the Widow, turning a huge bike just landing her foot on the ground. Well I'll tell you I was sliding on snow and drop my foot to kill the speed of the sled, my bone immediately cracked on two.

Being superheroes doesn't make them invincible. Yeah, a little blood, a few scratches... Give me a break!

Avengers: Age Where the Ideas have Become Too Old,22 April 2022,"In Age of Ultron, the unhurried dialogue/no-movement sequences are far better than the action sequences. Some people (usually fans of Marvel movies) just really have a strong taste in this sort of stuff and other people don't. There's the teamed-up superheroes discussing perilous sci-fi problems and forwarding into the action together. If you really enjoyed the first Avengers film, Age of Ultron might suit your preference. But there's too many elements ranging between the story, characters and villain that make absolutely no sense and the climax is dragged out to a ridiculous extent.

This sequel doesn't bring the superheroes together for the first time and give them a while to settle in which each other, as it shouldn't because the first Avengers did that and why waste time on that again? Instead of the charming-silly-but-with-motives sort of villain, Loki, the team of superheroes are up against an artificial intelligence that's making plans to destroy the world. The ideas are pretty good, but Joss Whedon executes them poorly.

Firstly, Avengers: Age of Ultron is overlong and boring. Boring in the context that there's usually a big lack of steam puffing through certain areas and somehow, the ""safe house"" sequence and moments where they're just chilling, are actually the most entertaining, pacy and funny moments of the film. The ""safe house"" zones in superhero action-adventures are extremely lazy place in most cases, but this time, the dialogue is good and there's some pretty good jokes to add the cherry on top.

The Marvel action where all the superheroes work together to kick bad guys' asses will appeal all fans of this type of genre. Having all the Marvel protagonists collide is a great idea in the first place, but the action sequences in Age of Ultron are extremely boring; they only slightly shift from the state they're all in every 5-10 minutes, making it stretched way too far. The attempts at humour during these times usually fail because it's boring.

It is obviously not a 10 out of 10 movie, no matter how dumb you are. It lacks tension, too much one liners in inappropriate moments and it is also very far from the original comic books (and I liked those plots better, I think the movies should be closer to the original reference).

An Okay Sequel Containing Lots of Action and CGI,14 January 2017,"This movie essentially begins with the Avengers raiding a Hydra stronghold in Eastern Europe and in the process seizing a staff previously belonging to Thor's brother Loki. Naturally, ""Thor"" (Chris Hemsworth) wants to take the scepter back to Asgard but he acquiesces for a few days to allow his Avenger teammate ""Tony Stark/Iron Man"" (Robert Downey Jr.) a couple of days to examine it a little further. Unfortunately, Tony Stark has no idea of what he has stumbled upon and accidentally unleashes a computerized being named ""Ultron"" (James Spader) who decides to help humanity evolve--by destroying it completely. To gain time and keep the Avengers occupied he creates an army of robots all controlled by his computer intelligence. Meanwhile, he subsequently acquires the metal used to make the shield for ""Captain America"" (Chris Evans) and forces a scientist named ""Dr. Helen Cho"" (Claudia Kim) to use her knowledge in synthetic tissue to create a new body for himself. Throw in the addition of several other superheroes and villains and the result is complete mayhem on earth. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that, from what I understand, this film made over $1.4 billion and ranks as one of the highest grossing films ever made. And with a profit margin like that additional sequels are already in the making. Be that as it may, however, I was not overly-impressed with this movie by any means. Although the CGI was top-notch I thought there were too many characters involved in too much action and too many sub-plots going to really amount to anything coherent. That being said, the fact that this film garnered so much money is certainly an achievement and nothing succeeds like success. But it was all a bit too much for me and I have rated it accordingly.

"Too much action, not enough plot.",24 May 2022,"It had a few good moments, but overall the movie felt like a massive step down after Guardians of the Galaxy. This movie felt like it was from 2010 whereas Guardians of the Galaxy still feels like it came out just last year. Age of Ultron had a lot of boring, long action sequences without a whole lot of character development or meaningful plot development. It was also hard to take the villain seriously when he's voiced by Robert ""Lizard King"" California.

5/10 for Painfully Average Action Flick. Not something you wanna watch more than once. In fact, I started writing this review with 35 minutes left because it felt like I had already seen everything the movie had to offer. I was getting so tired of the mindless action scenes towards the end that I almost fell asleep.",5
Not that different from mediocre Television,30 January 2023,"The first Avengers film was not quite a good movie, but it was a marvel of narrative efficiency with Whedon job mostly reduced to keep as many balls rolling as he can while adding some grace notes in the sidelines (in some ways it was the high point of early Marvel aesthetics of combining a bland surface and undervalued quirk personalities to add some flavor to it, a formula they seem to have mostly abandon this past 2 years after deciding people enjoy those bland surfaces well enough). Age of Ultron is a good deal more ambitious which unfortunate is part of its limitations. The plot is more character based with Whedon putting a futile earnest effort to serve a dozen actors well and there's some genuine desire to dig into American exceptionalism (not always with success) and build things around its characters eminent loneliness. The final result is just a huge mess, it is both overlong and feels like at least half hour worth of connective scenes that needed to be there got cut. It has no sense of how to move from one big setpiece to the next. Plots that are important either seem to come out of nowhere or get dropped without resolution, for instance it is good to see Whedon actually trying to do something with Iron Man's past as an arms merchant but I can only assume a big scene between him and the twins end up on the cutting room floor and without the whole subplot goes nowhere (overall this ilm seem to equal givenhints of things of actually use them to add depth). The action is way too chaotic and this is such a comic book film it often confounds angsty melodrama for character work. There is way too much heroes fighting heroes scenes (that said the nerd inside me will never be against the 50 year honored Avengers tradition of Iron Man trying to take a short cut, Captain America getting all self-righteous about it, they coming to blows and Thor getting to settle it). The last act is very questionable politically, but it is good to get a Marvel film that at least puts some actual stakes into saving people over simple destroying things. I also enjoy how Whedon uses Hawkeye's guy with a bow and arrow number to ground the action even if his script gets to cute overexplaning what he is doing. If this felt under control it might have amount to something but as it stand it is the a lot of cliff notes that go nowhere.",4

They're all exactly the same: 2 hours of the cinematic equivalent of a 6 versus 6 PVP video game. I like stories about people, not cartoon characters running roughshod over our planet for their amusement.

You got the good guys - whosits, whatshisface, and rest - against the bad guys - gibberish 1, gibberish 2, and the rest. Why do all superhero names sound like they were read off a 5 year old's participation trophy crayon spelling test hanging on mom's refrigerator?

We're expected to know all about the good guys because they get zero introduction or character development. Same with the bad guys.

There's tons of action where about a jillion NPCs die and neither side seems care at all about the carnage they're inflicting on the petty humans and the world they inhabit.

I won't spoil the shocking ending (the good guys win).

0 stars from me. It was loud, overlong, boring, pointless, and the human beings were just set dressing. I imagine it's 10 stars if you enjoy superheroes because it had all the superhero tropes.

But the action feels rather repetitive and hardly memorable. The humour is still great, especially when Downey Jr is around. But the best part of this film is something you wouldn't guess: it are the small intimate scenes between these characters. Especially Hawkeye, Black Widow and Mark Ruffalo as Dr Banner shine. Nice little and touching scenes. But that is hardly enough to earn this film a great score. The villain, Ultron, is an AI who things it is funny (it isn't). And the main problem is that he as an adversary is emotionless and therefore uninteresting. As are its puppets.

"""Fury, cap the power supply"" would have been too short of a movie",24 September 2023,"That - wouldn't happen. A virtual identity called Ultron tries to eradicate the Avengers. Crucially, Tony Stark himself created the lethal foe. That wouldn't happen because several organisations would already have formed that only revolve around shutting down the Stark Towers, for exactly that situation. Captain America in particular gets to know Tony Stark in 'Avengers Assemble.' A more likely scenario should be that Cap pulls his cell phone and tells Fury (their leader) to pull the plug on the Stark Tower. By the time this movie happens, he should have secretly invested all his spare time to figure out the Stark Tower and its weaknesses. Probably power supply. But then again, Cap evidently isn't much of a secret agent. Maybe they gave that serum to the wrong person. There is a reason why Natasha Romanov has to make do with the Hulk as a partner. Because Cap as a partner would get her killed. Instead of keeping the relationship a secret, he probably would show off in front of Tony Stark. Coming back to the movie, Ultron would get hold of that relationship, too, and just has to take Romanov hostage. Cap even drops a stupid comment on the tete-a-tete between Romanov and Banner (Hulk's alter ego). A movie later, in Captain America: Civil War, Romanov picks Stark's faction over Cap's, at first, and then sides with Cap, anyway. Cap would have been the obvious choice from the beginning if he wasn't useless, as exposed in this movie. 'Justice League' was probably better.",5

The answer is clear and objective: No. It's a film that tries to bet on something more serious with a lot more drama and darker photography and ends up not working. What promised to be a great age of ultron turned out to be just a weekend. The film fails to make you feel that this is something as destructive as the attack on New York was.

All the cast from the previous Avengers movie all reprise their roles. Robert Downey Junior was amazing as Ironman.

Scarlett Jhohanson was brilliant as Black Widow and was even more bad-ass in this movie, than any of her other films.

It's like an overstuffed turkey but a tasty one!,4 May 2015,"""Eugene O'Neill long."" Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) about an active Avengers' day

The bad news is that Avengers: Age of Ultron is not only long (141 min.) but also overstuffed like thanksgiving turkey that keeps giving until you can't take it anymore. Yet, the film is filling, that is, filled with explosive set pieces and characters aplenty. If any summer hero movie could have been split in two or three, this one could.

The good news is that it is fun, as always. Writer-director Joss Whedon has peppered the dialogue with smarts, like the above quote (I just sat through an O'Neill play, so I get it) and when Stark describes their challenge: ""This is going to be like finding a needle in the world's biggest haystack... fortunately, I brought a magnet!"" It's not that quips have been absent from other Marvel hero flicks, it's just that this iteration is filled with them. Unfortunately they are sometimes lost among the loud ubiquitous explosions.

I understand the need to appeal to young males and therefore to load the sci-fi thriller with testosterone, but this much is a loss for the more humanistic elements such as the intriguing love affair between the Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Hulk (Mark Ruffalo). Consider also the fascinating youngsters, twins Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen), who have powers capable of subduing the Avengers. So much story waiting in so many characters yet so much fighting.

Having just enjoyed Ex Machina, about artificial intelligence, I was pleased that beyond the special effects in Avengers lies a treatise on the dangers of man playing God, a lesson we have not learned from Frankenstein to 2001 to this film. Yet, something is there to be enjoyed when we can be cautioned about our pride through art.

So enjoy the first blockbuster of the summer. There is goodness in the mayhem: We learn to adjust to civility as we evolve, we hope, into higher beings: ""The world adjusts, evolves to live with changes."" Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson)",
A Visual Spectacle,3 May 2015,,
An Enjoyable And Superior Followup,26 April 2015,"The Avengers: Age Of Ultron is your typical modern day, summer blockbuster, Hollywood fare which trades absolute originality for massive scale.

It's an enjoyable ride that is both witty and darker in tone than 2012's Avengers, and thanks to the lack of need for nearly an hour of character basil exposition before getting to the main story, it's superior to it's predecessor too.

Length and noisy final act aside, Avengers: Age Of Ultron shows that Marvel know how to make an enjoyable superhero film which will appeal to all ages and that's something Warner Bros. need to learn after the utterly depressing and dystopian Man Of Steel.",

"Once more into the breach, dear superheroes",5 May 2015,"Joss Whedon has done it again. The man who directed and wrote the hugely successful ""Avengers Assemble"" has performed the same roles with the same achievement with this sequel. The first movie was challenging enough with its deployment of no less than six S.H.I.E.L.D superheroes, but this time - as well as Ironman (Robert Downey Jr), Captain America (Chris Evans), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), the Incredible Hulk (Mark Ruffalo}, Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) - we have new villains in the shape of the Maximoff twins, Pietro/Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and Wanda/Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) plus the eponymous Ultron (voiced by James Spader), not to mention assorted other characters.

So, at first viewing, it's not always clear what's going on but the whole thing is a visual treat and I was fortunate enough to experience it on the Sky Superscreen in 3D at London's O2 Arena. The pacing is superb: it opens with a big action sequence and closes with a huge action battle and, in between quieter interludes alternate with lots more action. All the superheroes get to show off their very individual talents but they are seen to blend as a team and two of them are starting to become emotionally involved.

The story again led by ""Iron Man"" Tony Stark, performed by Robert Downey Jr., as the Marvel superhero assembling kicks right in from the start in storming a ""Hydra"" occupied Transylvanian castle.

Highlight become an African-town-sight full confrontation between Tony Stark and Bruce Banner aka ""The Hulk"", solidly acted by sophisticated American actor Mark Ruffalo, as the ""Iron Man"" must utilize his hulkbuster suit to engage the green beast.

Acting cast, surrounding some of Hollywood's finest performers are convincingly directed and backed by producer Kevin Feige as ""Age of Ultron"" becomes the fourth highest grossing picture of 2015, shy after Universal's ""Furious 7"" and ""Jurassic World"", nevertheless beating in audience attraction by overall winner ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"".",
Behold The Vision .,18 May 2015,"AVENGERS : AGE OF ULTRON, is that rare movie in which the second movie surpasses the first in every way. Here Joss Whedon builds on the first Avengers movie and expands on it. Adding layers. The action is explosive and impressive. The Story is a beautiful love story to the Avengers 50 year history. The film opens with the Avengers smashing a HYDRA Base and regaining Loki's wand from the first one. When the Avengers throw a farewell party for Thor who plans to return the wand to Asgard. Tony Stark and Bruce Banner decide to examine it and see what makes it tick. They discover the wand has a mind of its own and use it to their Ultron protective program. a program designed to protect the world and usher in a era of peace Except, The AI sees things differently. It decides that the greatest threat to mankind is mankind. and The greatest threat to Ultron is the Avengers. The film moves at a break neck speed. The fights are mouth dropping. but that's not the only important thing here. There is a actual story that is buried underneath the action. a subtle story about man over relying on machines and the need for heroes. A major step up over the first one in every way. And Paul Bettany steals the film as The Vision a android conceived to be the ultimate weapon. And instead becomes one of the Avengers. Worth seeing more then once.",
Might be my favorite Marvel film ever,7 May 2015,Avengers Age of Ultron is likely going to be the best experience I've had in a theatre this year and it is the best I've had in a long time. This is just a fun film. All of the main cast members of the original film return for the sequel and the chemistry is as good as ever. The comedy is great I love the jokes that are scattered throughout the movie. Robert Downey Jr is of course amazing as Iron Man but he is just so funny in this movie and this is probably the funniest I've seen him. One of the downsides of the original film is there is not quite enough Hulk but there is lots of him in this film. The action sequences are amazing and there are so many stunts in the film that leave you in awe. Hawkeye gets more attention in this film as well and we learn more about his character which only makes the movie better. After this movie Hawkeye may not be considered the dud Avenger. Plus there are great classic performances from Chris Evans and Scarlett Johansson. Now there are also some new additions which I think are all added well and all are good strong characters. Quicksilver was certainly an interesting character I liked the effects they used when he ran and I also enjoyed Scarlet Witch who has already been confirmed as a returning character in the future. Then we have Vision who is amazing but doesn't get as much screen time as I would like but will likely play a bigger part in the coming films. Finally we have the villain Ultron. Ultron was not what I expected but he was not a disappointment either. James Spader does an excellent job for the voice but when I watched the trailer it looked like Ultron was going to be a villain we could love that was dark and complex. He is more sarcastic and funny than anything. I liked Ultron but I did not love him. The only other problem I have with this movie is I thought it needed to be longer. Director Joss Whedon has said already that the film was originally 3 hours long but 40 minutes were cut. I hope that when the film is released on DVD and Blu Ray we will get a chance to see the directors cut and I may even enjoy it more. This movie could very well be my personal favorite Marvel film and so far it is my favorite movie this year. I recommend that you watch Age of Ultron in the theatre and not a home because it is a great experience.,

Not quite as well made as the first but still a great movie.,25 April 2018,,
Even Better Now... A Masterpiece.,2 May 2021,Given this was the only movie we got to see the full team of Avengers it will always go down in history as the greatest Avengers movie. Civil war broke them up too quickly. Seeing the big three b The Big Three in team format is legendary. This movie was well written and has tremendous depth. That is something current woke Marvel has completely overlooked. We will all Miss movies of this quality going forward.,
The Best Comic Adaptation Sequel Of All-Time! Great Film.,3 May 2015,"A lot of talk had been thrown about that the first Avengers was the best adventure film ever made, knocking out classics like LOTR, Raiders of the Lost Ark and Spider-Man 2. Well, Age of Ultron actually did what many thought of as impossible. It tops the first Avengers film. How do you top a masterpiece? By delivering the same fun, action and humor but adding more complexity and more depth. Whedon and company should be commended for taking it to the next level even if most people thought those heights weren't even possible given the love for the first film.

I guess it shouldn't be such a surprise because Marvel has set this up from the start and have done so delivering some instant classics along the way. Most every solo hero film has been rewarding in some way or another. In this instant classic, they combined the greatness of what we've already seen but added even more epic elements. No other franchise gets individual solo films to develop a film's characters. They had the budget and the right guy in place and he made it all work. Most everyone is calling AoU the best sequel ever made but it may just be the greatest adventure film of all-time.",
Best movie in the world,7 November 2015,"I think it was inevitable that this sequel would have a hard time satisfying the fans and critics. The first movie was not only a major first time event in showcasing all these superhero characters together on the big screen for the first time, but it was also a shock that it worked so well. Naturally there was the wow factor, the surprise, we were all wanting a hit but really, who knew. Everything in that movie was fresh and new (to a degree), mainly because this Avengers team were together for the first time doing it. So could this sequel carry the ever growing pressures of the hype machine? Plot wise its pretty much as before, the A-team are up against an enemy who has a massive army of robot drones, as before when it was a massive army of aliens. The difference being the enemy has been inadvertently created by Stark, or least turned out to be evil which was not foreseen. This creation also kick starts the bickering within the team which will eventually lead to other movies, and there's one problem of the movie (and all Marvel movies now). These don't really feel like movies (to me), they feel more like a requirement, an obligation or constant filler merely to lead you into the next movie, and so on. Most of this movie is simply exposition and setups for other things that will happen in other movies, interspersed with high octane action. It never really feels like a stand alone movie, admittedly these comic book movies aren't really like that of course, its all part of a wider universe (like the comics), but at times it kinda feels like you're being cheated.",
