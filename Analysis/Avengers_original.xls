Not as good as infinity war..,29 April 2019,"But its a pretty good film. A bit of a mess in some parts, lacking the cohesive and effortless feel infinity war somehow managed to accomplish. Some silly plot holes and characters that could've been cut (Ahem, captain marvel and thanos). The use of Captain marvel in this film was just ridiculous. Shes there at the start, bails for some reason? And then pops up at the end to serve no purpose but deux ex machina a space ship...

The past thanos part wasn't necessary when you think about it, they could've done this film without a real 'villain' And it would've worked and been a original take on a super hero film without using the same formula we have seen in 10+ super hero films already. The entire final battle felt like a rehashed messy battle, with a bunch more characters against thanos - basically mixing the space battle from infinity war; iron man, spider man etc and the final battle of infinity war with captain america, thor etc.. mashing those two into one within this new film. The scenes of trying to pull the gauntlet off his hand.. it all felt like a rehash.

To me the best part of the film was the first act and half of the second, when everyone is lost and trying to figure out how to continue on. really interesting themes that followed the pay off from infinity wars ending. And then the time heist part. Tho the heist part should've been much more stretched out. With only small parts of thanos within that, and not having him be the big bad again. But just a side character that gets in the way a little bit.

And the setting up for 'new avengers' to replace the beloved actors and characters we have come to associate with these films.. they do not get me at all excited for the next phase in marvel films. Falcon, Valkyrie, blackpanther, cap marvel? I just dont care about them at all. And their actors lack any charisma or depth.

To me this feels like a closing of marvel films that I'll really enjoy for my pop corn fix. I've given infinity war a 10/10 and some of the stand alone films 8's and 9's. But I have a sinking feeling this will not be happening in the future except the guardians of the galaxy films.

It seems i maybe in the minority for my feelings towards this film, but im not sugar coating my opinion like it seems a few people are doing due to nostalgia. Its good, but not great. Had the opportunity to be better, maybe? And the setting up of new characters to come possible reflects on my score to... Because i just don't give two cents about any of them",7
Emotional but bit messy.,27 April 2019,,7
The zenith of the MCU franchise.,24 April 2019,"I feel like I'm wasting my time writing down my thoughts about Avengers: Endgame, because nothing I (or any critic) could say about it would ever dissuade a prospective viewer from seeing it. But after having had the chance to watch it at a preview screening, I can't help but say a few spoiler-free words.

I'm not your average fanboy -- most long-running franchises have bored me at this point, and I couldn't care less about the newest Star Wars episode or whether there will be another film set in the Harry Potter universe.

But Marvel films have been consistently watchable, with many solid entries and a few great ones (Winter Soldier, Ragnarok, the first Guardians of the Galaxy among others). And after Infinity War ended with a cliffhanger, I was looking forward to the conclusion. Boy, was I not disappointed!

Very few highly-anticipated movies live up to the hype, but Avengers: Endgame is one of them. It's the perfect follow up to Infinity War, and the absolute zenith of the Marvel franchise. It's hard to see how they'll be able to top this one.

It's surprisingly inventive (even when you know where the story is headed, the plot takes a few tangents getting there), emotionally engaging (a few people were crying in the theater) and surprisingly funny (this is probably the most I've laughed in a Marvel film since Thor: Ragnarok). Visually speaking, it's a true spectacle (topping Infinity War in the 'epic battle' stakes), and even though it's three hours long, it doesn't feel bloated. The only times I glanced at my watch was because I was hoping there would be more time before the end.

Yes, it's a superhero movie, but an immensely entertaining one (especially for fans who have seen all the pictures that came before it: there are tons of references and inside jokes to reward the faithful).

If ""Return of the King"" managed to win Best picture at the 2003 Oscars Avengers: Endgame deserves at least a nomination. It's as good (and in many ways better) a conclusion to a fantasy/genre series as the Peter Jackson film,.

Go see it.",9
Crazy in every sense,26 November 2021,"This film is an emotional rollercoaster with some of the coolest superhero plot lines ever drawn up. It's straight up the most epic Marvel film that will probably ever be created. I don't see how Marvel could ever top this, but getting to see these characters all together at least one last time was a reward all on its own.",10
They had no right to do that,26 April 2019,"First review from me. This film deserves it. A superhero film, marvel or not, does not have the right to send me on the emotional rollercoaster that End Game did. It has no right to do what it did, paying tribute to 10 years of films whilst changing the rules as to what a superhero film should be.

I laughed, lots. I cried, lots. I cheered (quietly and internally of course), lots I even punched the air in a ""go on!"" during one scene

I can honestly say, no film has ever moved me like that. Hours later, my heart was still pounding, the adrenaline still flowing from this epic piece of film making.

Made by fans, for fans. Are there flaws? Yes. If you over think the story of course there is. But it works. It flows. It fits.

Go with it. Enjoy the ride.

Soak up every second, it doesn't feel like 3 hours, it feels like a flow of story reaching a conclusion that will shock and move you.

I have nothing else to say.

10/10. Well done Russo brothers. Well done!

Fans! Assemble!",10
Epic Ending,26 April 2019,"Thank you Marvel, End Game is an ending that give me speechless.",10
Perfect ending,8 May 2019,"After watching Infinity war, I was looking forward to much more this time, still a perfect ending.",10
Best movie I've seen in ages,9 October 2019,"Let me start by saying THIS is how you wrap a saga!!!! I loved this movie, it was an emotional rollercoaster from open to close, and a fitting way to pay tribute to the legend of Stan Lee.",10
My Childhood...,20 June 2019,Wow... All i can say is that the movie ended my entire childhood in the most perfect way!! It kept you on your feet the whole way through!! Marvel somehow manages to add comedy to the most intense situations. its Awesome!! The battle scene was out of this world!! I just... wow.. Thank you marvel. I love you 3000!!!

"Amazing, but the more I dwell on it the worse it becomes",26 April 2019,,6
The ending made all 22 movies worth it,24 April 2019,"If you're going to watch this movie, avoid any spoilers, even spoiler free reviews. Which is why I'm not going to say anything about the movie. Not even my opinion. All I'm going to say is:

The crowd applauded 3 times during the movie, and stood up to clap their hands after. This I have never witnessed in a Dutch cinema. Dutch crowds aren't usually passionate about this. I checked the row where I was sitting, and people were crying. After the movie, I was seeing people with smudged mascara. That's all I have to say about the movie.",10
So much potential lost ....,30 April 2019,After Infinity War I had huge expectations. Unfortunately I think it doesn't follow the comic book at all because they wanted some kind of closure of the story. I saw a lot of 10 star reviews and I cannot believe the majority of people like this movie more than Infinity War. I'm not saying it wasn't entertainment to watch but the feeling is that all heroes were forced to fit in a movie paying a big price to the story. There are moments in the movie where the rules from all other Marvel movies are broken and characters which were build over hours of screen time were reduced in order to make space for others. The story is average at best with big flaws.,6
"Entertaining, but also disappointing",29 April 2019,,5
Epic movie,25 September 2021,As always avengers didn't disappoint even with a few loops or inconsistencies. Hope marvel does more movies about some characters from avengers.,10
The End of an Era!,25 April 2019,"After Avengers Infinity War, we waited for the Avengers Endgame. We wondered how the story would go on, how our heroes would turn back, what would be the end of Thanos. Many theories related to this have been put forward. Avengers Endgame was undoubtedly the most anticipated film of recent years. Normally, the higher the expectation, the higher the probability of disappointment. But this is not the case for Endgame. Whatever you're expecting, you find much more in the film. This means that the biggest concern about the film has disappeared.

On the other hand, another comparison comes up. Is Endgame more successful than Infinity War? We can comfortably say it Avengers Infinity War is just the beginning of the story. Endgame was the finale of the story. So we shouldn't think of these two films as two separate stories. There is only one story divided into two parts.

Avengers Endgame is, above all, a great homage to the ten-year history of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The story highlights the original Avengers team. Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Hulk, Black Widow and Hawkeye are at the center of events. No character comes in front of them. Of course there are many characters that play an important role in the story outside the original Avengers team. Everyone's concern was that Captain Marvel, who was included in the Marvel world, overshadowed other heroes. We can say that this certainly did not happen. What is important in this struggle is not how strong you are, but how good you are. This comes to the fore in all areas. It gives good message about being a hero and a family.

Of course, Avengers Endgame has some critical aspects. For example, is the three-hour period necessary in terms of the story? It can be discussed. The head of the story moves much slower than the rest. It also drags the heroes into an emotional predicament. Then the tempo is rising and the heavy scenes we are watching are getting more meaningful. The last 45 minutes of the movie is fully action packed. But the last 45 minutes goes so fast that you don't even realize it. Action and battle scenes are really successful. There is not even a slight distress about visual effects. There are also slight logic errors in the film, but in general the story is so successful that these details become meaningless and insignificant after a certain point.

Lastly, Avengers Endgame doesn't have a movie end scene. Because after the film's final, there is no need for another scene. The Marvel legend Stan Lee appears with a small stage. But this is the last surprise scene in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Moreover, there is no clue about Marvel's future. This makes us wonder more about Spider-Man: Far from Home. 10/10",10
Incredible,26 April 2019,"No words...absolutely incredible, THE best way to end the whole series. Watching all the movies to finish with this, every single hour was worth it, hats off to Marvel 👏🏽",10
No Justice for this Film,28 April 2019,"I loved how the story of the Infinity War was conceived. With all the fight scenes and the emotional aspect of the movie, especially the end part, everything was superb. But this is supposed to be a wrap-up film. The directors and writers just destroyed it all. What's the point of doing a hype over Captain Marvel for this movie when you just give her a few minutes of screen time? It would be forgiven if you give her an amazing fight with the villain during the climax. But what have you done? With just a few kicks and punches and that's it. It doesn't give a scratch over Thano's face. What a crap!!!

You also ruin Hulk! He is supposed to be the strongest Avenger after the events of Infinity War, after all the disappointment and frustration he has experienced when Hulk won't face Thanos. But this time, he's just as good as nothing Avenger. I wonder why they did not give Thanos and Hulk a fight of a lifetime. I'm really surprised that they did not even get face-to-face when all hell breaks loose.

This movie is dubbed as an action movie but got 75% of the time talking and mumbling.

There's no justice at all to those beloved characters and this movie. You have ruined my expectations.",10
The best Marvel Superhero movie ever and also the epic conclusion to the 21 movies in the MCU,24 April 2019,Avengers: Endgame is above all the best Marvel superhero movie to date. This is also the best and epic conclusion to the 21 movies in the first 10 years of the MCU. This is the epic culmination. The best storytelling ever told.,10

Perfection,24 April 2019,"Unbelievable. For Marvel to pull this tour de force of a film is unreal. 21 films. 21 films culminating in the conclusion of endgame.

Absolute Perfection End Game,24 April 2019,Rating 10/10 Absolute perfection end game !! Good acting performance to all the characters. Great cgi's. Truly epic & perfect ending to a long journey of marvel movie. Go see it you wont regret it !! Perfection Marvel Endgame !!,10
A little bit underwhelmed,24 April 2019,"Don't get me wrong, the movie was great, but would I watch it a second time? Probably not - until the DVD comes out.

I've seen infinity war at least 5 times, and it's one of my favorite films.

That being said, i will compare the two movies for sure, and I just disliked the pacing, it was all over the place. Some Characters felt off, and some got little to no screen time, where others had too much.

It's just too many characters for one movie, even though infinity war did it much better, with just as many characters. I just can't put my finger on it.

The fighting scenes were alright, the first half lacked action, but the second half delivered some good solid scenes, nothing groundbreaking, but fun to watch. They can't reinvent the wheel, neither do they want to. They stick to what works, and that's alright.

All in all, the movie was a close 8/10, the fanboys who give it a 10 are just blind to accept the mistakes the movie made. It's not a perfect film, even an 8 is really generous in my opinion. The Movie works with nostalgia and gives fans of the MCU the things they wanted, more or less.

Still thinking Thor 3 was the best MCU movie. Sue me.",8
Huge fan left underwhelmed!!!,30 April 2019,I went in with the highest expectations and came out underwhelmed and disappointed. its nowhere near as good as infinity war !!!,8
"Just ok,but youre a sheep if you believe its the best",30 April 2019,,7
"The most satisfying ending, just like the Russo's said.",24 April 2019,"This movie proves the Russo brothers are in a league of their own when it comes to closing a franchise this big. In my opinion they pulled of the most satisfying ending this story arc could have.

It's nothing without its previous 21 movies. Must watch for every movie fan.",10
Really messy,26 April 2019,,6
A huge disappointment,18 May 2019,,2
Just so disappointed!,28 June 2019,"I expected so much from this film but just feel so disappointed by it. A poor and incoherent story with so many contradictions within it plus a total waste of my favourite character - amongst others (like Thanos himself). I did go and rewatch it in the cinema a second time and realised that, without all the excitement and expectation I went in with the first time I was just really really bored.

It did have some nice ""moments"", especially the anticipated big fight towards the end. Some characters get a good inning - love Antman and, of course, Iron Man but this is my least favourite MCU film.

And the ending...........sigh!",
In the list of my top 5 favourite Marvel Movies.,20 September 2023,"""Avengers: Endgame"" - A Spectacular Culmination of Marvel's Cinematic Universe

In the realm of superhero cinema, ""Avengers: Endgame"" stands as an unprecedented achievement. Directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, this epic finale to the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) represents the culmination of over a decade of storytelling and character development. Clocking in at just over three hours, ""Endgame"" is a sprawling, emotionally charged spectacle that delivers on its promise to provide closure for beloved characters while reshaping the MCU's future.

The film begins in the aftermath of ""Avengers: Infinity War,"" with half of all life in the universe obliterated by the malevolent Thanos (Josh Brolin). The surviving Avengers are left reeling, grappling with guilt and loss. The emotional weight of this situation is palpable, setting a somber tone that lingers throughout the movie.

One of the film's strengths lies in its character-driven narrative. Each Avenger is given ample screen time to grapple with the consequences of their actions and confront their own vulnerabilities. Robert Downey Jr. Delivers a standout performance as Tony Stark/Iron Man, showcasing his character's evolution from a self-centered genius to a selfless hero. Similarly, Chris Evans as Steve Rogers/Captain America and Scarlett Johansson as Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow bring depth and gravitas to their roles.

""Endgame"" also skillfully employs humor to offset its darker moments. The banter between characters provides much-needed levity, ensuring the film remains entertaining even during its most emotionally charged sequences. This balance of humor and pathos has been a hallmark of the MCU and is executed with finesse here.

One of the film's most impressive feats is its ability to seamlessly weave together multiple storylines and characters. The time-travel aspect of the plot allows the Avengers to revisit key moments from previous films, resulting in a nostalgic and satisfying trip down memory lane for fans. It's a testament to the filmmakers' dedication to honoring the MCU's history while moving the narrative forward.

The action sequences in ""Endgame"" are nothing short of spectacular. The climactic battle in the third act is a visual feast, featuring a jaw-dropping array of heroes, powers, and epic showdowns. It's a triumphant moment that pays off years of anticipation and buildup. The Russo brothers' direction, combined with Alan Silvestri's stirring score, elevates these sequences to a cinematic crescendo.

As for the film's antagonist, Thanos remains a formidable and complex foe. Brolin's motion-capture performance adds depth to the character, and his motivations, while morally questionable, are presented with a degree of philosophical nuance. Thanos remains one of the MCU's most compelling villains.

However, ""Endgame"" is not without its criticisms. Some viewers may find the film's lengthy runtime a bit daunting, and certain plot elements involving time travel could be seen as overly convoluted. Additionally, a few character arcs, while emotionally satisfying, may leave fans divided.

In conclusion, ""Avengers: Endgame"" is a monumental achievement in the world of superhero cinema. It successfully pays tribute to the characters and stories that have captivated audiences for years while charting a bold new course for the MCU. With its powerful performances, humor, and breathtaking action sequences, it's a fitting and emotional conclusion to an era of cinematic storytelling. While it may not be without its minor flaws, ""Endgame"" stands as a testament to the enduring appeal of the superhero genre and will likely be remembered as a cinematic milestone for years to come.",10
Not as good as infinity war but a great movie,13 December 2021,,8
Very disappointing,12 May 2019,"Right in the beginning, you know how the movie is going to end...the good guys are going to win. How anti-climactic that was.. The stage is not set right (half of all humanity is gone, but the enormity of that is not explored...)...when you have Thanos give his explanation as to why he did what he did, I found myself thinking - well, he actually has a point. In the meanwhile, every single superhero is given time to fight, say some cute things, some say a few smart things, a few even manage to say profoundly philosophical statements... The quantum physics explanations used to explain how things are done, are plainly non sense... ..they just made stuff up as they went on. Alls well that ends well. Except we spent 3 hours to find that out.",9

Spider-Man 2 is my personal favourite, but please stop giving these movies a 10/10. Endgame is a 7 at best. It's probably the most flawed Avengers film story wise. It's popcorn fun, but it's like if we let Fast & Furious or Transformers films in the top 250. Meanwhile 2001: A Space Oddisey is lower than Infinity War.",

Too long and sentimental

Most of the focus is on the original avengers which is good but many of the storylines were just not very exciting

I would wait to see this on video",
The Perfect Finale,24 April 2019,"Avengers: Endgame is the final film to the Infinity saga in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The story is emotional, unpredictable, unforgettable, complex and intense. The story does continue on right after infinity war had finsihed, and I thought it was a good way too start because the characters can give you an understanding of how they are feeling. How much loss they have witnessed. During the three hour film, you care so much for the characters that it makes you want them to live through the whole time, leaving with no casualties. The acting by the cast is outstanding, none of their lines sounded cheesy. Chris Evans and Robert Downey Jr especially. The audience has never seen the two characters shine so bright and powerful over the last 11 years. The visuals are the most impressive, it is shown to be Oscar worthy and you would be hungry for more as the film continues on. The final battle was the bomb, the mother of all battles, better then Ready Player One's finale. It's so big and all of it fits in perfectly. Avengers Endgame is the perfect finale that has been set up over the last 11 years. Its a rewatchable film and you will never see the characters the same way as you have seen them from the past films.",10
Whatever it takes...,17 May 2019,"Hello again everyone! It's been almost a month since thousands of Marvel fans (including myself) got to see the one and only Endgame for the very first time, without having a clue of what could possibly happen. And as with most of the people who already watched it...there are no words to describe how this amazingly crafted piece of superhero movie-making just...blew me away.

I will start by giving its credit to the acting work of everyone. When we appreciate that, we can see that this isn't just another sci-fi flick where no one does exactly a great effort to make a remarkable performance. No. This is a movie that presents us a group of heroes that, after long years of saving the earth from any menace, are giving the last of themselves in order to give the planet one last shot. The performances made it all seem authentic and real.

Now, the story. God. The story is many things. Sometimes it's funny, as any other of the previous movies from the MCU. But also it's deep, melancholic, tragic, and most of all, undeniably exciting.

10/10. Probably most of the people that will read this had already watched it. But in case you haven't, you really, REALLY ought to do so. Probably during quite a few years, there will be no other film of the genre that can possibly make you feel all of the emotions that Avengers Endgame made the audiences feel, and made me feel. Don't miss it for anything

Peace!",10
Decent enough end,26 May 2020,,10
One of Hollywood's defining moments,10 July 2019,A breathtaking experience. Marvel played it's top trump card and blew alway any competition from start to finish. The battle scene is simply one of the if not greatest pieces of cinema ever. But it kept on giving after this. Anyone who gives this film less than a 10 is selling it extremely short.,10
Avengers at their best!,16 October 2019,This movie picks up after the devestating events of infinity War that wiped out half of all living creatures. In this movie you can really feel a sense of urgency from the avengers. And the way the characters are taken is all very pleasing. The acting is some of the best in an avengers film. The 3 hour run time is not a problem what's ever and I could've happily sat watching it for 5 or even 6 hours without feeling it dragging on.,10
A Massive Showoff of Marvel Super Heros,10 October 2019,A perfect blend of all Marvel super Heroes in One movie ....Thats the Avengers End Game,10
These get worse!!!,14 June 2019,I don't really know what all the hype is about. Bored watching this as it's the same again just rehashed. Glad to see the back of the Avengers to be honest.,7
A near perfect end,20 November 2023,"This films quality depends on how you watched it and who you are. If you watched most of the MCU up to this point like I did then this will be a revolutionary endgame that redefines all of film culture. Otherwise it seems rather bad and underwhelming. The film has a forward moving plot, great acting and some CGI actually worth looking at. This film didn't become the highest grossing movie of all time for no reason. It does have some obvious flaws tropes and plot holes but other than that acts as a brilliant finale to the infinity saga. Now don't watch the multiverse saga. It willn't ruin your opinion but they aren't good sequels either. All in all a film worth watching if you have watched the entire MCU up to that point, otherwise an okay film. And watch infinity war before you watch this, otherwise literally nothing will make sense.",9
Everyone just calm down...,26 April 2019,"...and pull the hype train over. Amazing fun, stunning spectacle great performances especially RDJ. It's just not the whole sum of its parts. Lots of great parts but not cohesively held. Too much Comedy with one character essentially now just full comedy relief. The most ridiculous coincidences and a couple of plot holes. You will laugh, you will get gut punched and for some you will cry, but then you will wonder what really happened in that 3 hours. Did it need 3 hours? No. Is it better than infinity war? No. Will you enjoy it? Definitely.",7
Not worthy of the hype it got,20 May 2019,,4
"Was promised a chocolate cake, turned out to be cake of manure.",9 May 2019,"Let's be clear - there was a lot of talking about this film, about how great it will be. Turned out? It was a pretty decent story about time traveling (I honestly like those). I even thought I like it, aside from some little things that don't even worth mentioning. But the ending - oh, let me talk about the ending. It is so horrible that it erased any good impression this movie could've left. I don't have the problem with how it ends, with events presented. I have the problem with how boring, non-aesthetic and amateur it was filmed. I'm furious that funeral scene turned out to be such a cheap vulgarity, such an emptiness that tries to play with viewer's emotions - and, sadly, fails. This is what the character died for? To be honored... With this? Boy, oh boy. I don't know how many people actually like this scene, but I sure do not. Also - diversity. As a commercial product in the first place, a movie about diverse characters, well, completely non-diversed. Heteronormative, I would say, and in 2019 it is quite anachronistic. Quite obvious, of course, that the company is afraid of possible risks and profit losses - another reason to think about what good such soulless capitalistic approach can give us? From where I stand, nothing good. I don't want to be a consumer, I want to be a viewer that is not treated like a money account. Anyway, I was bitter about it just a little - after all, what can you expect from Marvel and Russos, really? They are not Taika Waititi after all (how honestly great it would be if Taika Waititi filmed all Avengers movies is story for another time), so even queer-coding isn't present. What got me furious is that Russo had the nerves to actually say they included LGBT-representation there. Leaving alone term ""LGBT-representation"" and why I have problems with this phrasing, let's see what we have here. And what we have, fellow viewers who don't enjoy tasteless similarity in their films, is a huge slap on our faces and our egos. This is what we can call a proper representation these days? I doubt it. It's so elusive I even didn't noticed it in the first place, thinking that the man could be talking about any people from his family. So, if I can read a text hermeneutically and headcanon some queer characters in there, does that mean a film has representation in it? Or, more important, does it mean director has the right to be bragging about such representation? Last one - certainly not.",
Your hopes and dreams served on a platter,25 April 2019,"Avengers: Endgame is literally everything you have wanted AND MORE in a Marvel movie. I'm not going to lie, it is slow to get into at the start, but the last hour is the reason I HAD TO give this film a 10/10. Honestly, as everyone has mentioned, it's a culmination of everything good in Marvel. It's beauty, perfection and whatever else you can think of. Endgame lived up to its hype and certain characters truly ended in such an amazing way. You'll never expect ANYTHING. No joke, I am going to have to go watch this again!! 3000% recommended ;-)",10

Good but didn't live up,2 May 2019,I was super excited to see this movie after Infinity War ended but I left rather disappointed. It was good but I felt like the first hour or so was wasted space. I did love Thor though.,8
Fitting End,24 April 2019,Despite what others may say or have said this film was far from predictable. I certainly lost my bets. I both laughed and cried during this film.

Pure torture,6 August 2019,"I had to take several breaks, walk the dogs, play videogames and clean the house, while watching this absolutely ridiculous and nonsensical pile of rubbish and now afterwards, I'm asking myself why I put myself through such suffering. To what end. I guess I was hoping there would be one scene or at least one line that put a smile on my face or made me feel anything at all except extreme pain and boredom. There wasn't any of that unfortunately, so I just wasted three hours of my life I could have spent on basically anything else and it would have been more worth while. I can't decide which one was more painful to watch, this or Aquaman? Both equally and utterly disappointing I guess.",7

To be honest, that was the greatest movie and this was no way near that. It has so many loopholes and extra scenes, I don't know what Russo brothers were thinking. It got lucky just because of all the buildup that the previous movies made, otherwise it would have end up just like justice league.",

Truly Beautiful,6 August 2023,"I just watched the Avengers movies and some of the infinity saga and I truly think this is a great movie, the CGI and acting were wonderful and the ending was truly a masterpiece and was probably the best ending for a movie saga (don't quote me on this). There are some low points but they are they don't effect the true rating which is a ten, this movie deservers the 8.4. Or an 8.5, I kinda have a bias. Cause i grew up with the marvel movies specifically Iron Man and stuff but the bias does not effect my rating. I live it and many others love it as well i regard this the end 0of the entire mcu from Iron Man - No Way Home, the other multiverse movies are mid and are very odd.",10

"The End of a Saga, and the Beginning for Another",9 January 2020,"Avengers: Endgame is quite possibly the most hyped up movie of all time. The excitement surrounding this films release is a dream come true for Marvel Studios and Disney. With that being said, I have looked forward to this film since it was called Infinity War Part 2 back in 2015 or so. I really enjoyed my time watching this and it marked the end of an era. I finally realized a couple years ago how much the MCU means to me and how much these characters mean to me that I gladly would accept anything this movie did.

The CGI was good, but the green screen showed a little bit (meaning the backgrounds looked fake sometimes), the performances from Robert Downey Jr. and Chris Evans were great because they treated this movie seriously, the cameos in here felt welcomed and the amount of locations in this movie really make it feel like the Avengers are desperate to go anywhere and do anything to save their fallen friends. With all this being said this is a very well made movie worth your time and money.",10
Like saying goodbye to your pet dog,4 September 2019,"Wow. This film will have you going through every emotion imaginable. If you have followed every Marvel movie in sequence leading up to this conclusion, you will soon be left feeling like you have lost a family member. An amazing end to this Marvel chapter.",10
Avengers:Endgame historic performance,7 January 2020,"Let's talk about the enormity of this film and what Marvel just accomplished.

First, this movie did not disappoint. It is very hard to contemplate a movie that will ever have as much or more anticipation than Endgame. Just think about the build up of this film. From May 2008 to April 2019, Marvel, in 21 films, introduced heroes, villains, plots, side plots, family members, love interests and countless Easter eggs that culminated into this film.

Second, in a movie full with 10+ main characters, Marvel did an unbelievable job featuring each one and staying true to the characters we've all fallen in love with. This point could easily be a thesis paper for a doctoral candidate. The development and story arcs of characters, individually and collectively, in the midst of struggle and triumph is nothing short of amazing. The attention to detail and thoughtful craftsmanship is true artwork. One knock fans may have is the forced fandom moments. We have so many beloved characters but these moments comes as certain team-up pairings during the big fight that are great but also forced and stereotypical.

Lastly, this movie is beauty in motion. Mainly, the movie looks and sounds wonderful. If there is one knock against the movie, the final fight at points was too dark for some of the characters. Otherwise, the final fight displays exactly what many of the DC movies have failed with, Hero power display. Marvel did such a great job of making you feel every punch, kick, hammer throw but also made you feel like you were in motion with each character (thus why I believe 4D would be very good). The sound editing is very good and the song selections in this movie help the viewers follow the emotional roller-coaster ride everyone believes they are in for.

Marvel created near perfection for fans (or a near perfect ending). And the ending of this movie, isn't even technically the finish to Phase 3 of their universe. That would be Spider-man: Homecoming coming soon. Phase 4 and 5 are also already in the works. Everyone that was a part of this movie and the first 3 phases should be applauded, but their work is not yet done because for those with the greatest power comes great responsibility.",10
The more I think about it,6 May 2019,"Enjoyable movie that takes to long to get into the action and doesn't make any sense once you step back and think about what they've done. Even their explanations on what they were going to do, what they did do, and the final outcomes make no sense. I believe the world would be an even bigger mess when they were done, and Steve broke all the rules!",6
Amazing Final Film in the MCU's Infinity Saga (NO SPOILERS),29 April 2019,"The 22-movie Infinity Saga of the MCU comes to a close in its best film yet. Avengers: Endgame is everything we wanted and more. It's hilarious, it's action-packed, and has one of the best scenes I've ever seen in a superhero film, let alone any movie. It's full of fan service and nods to the previous films. I don't really have any issues with the film, at least those that are not spoilers anyway. If I had one non-spoiler issue with the film it would be fact that the first hour is a bit slow but afterwards it picks up and never stops. Really any complaints I have with this film is shut out by everything else. My complaints are just nitpicks. It fits its three hour runtime very well and provides a highly satisfying end to the 11 year saga that began with Iron Man in 2008. The MCU has set a new direction and I can't wait to see what happens next.",10

Amazing finale,14 November 2021,"It's definitely not as strong an impression as it was on first viewing, which makes perfect sense, but I still think the film was extremely successful on multiple levels. One of the better things is that the three-hour film is not boring at any point, it seemed to me to last ""only"" two hours, which is not easy to achieve. I also look at this film as the finale or the last episode of a series you've been watching for years, which on the one hand is actually true. So much has happened before this film, so many characters and events. This film is just the crown of it all, one big rounded whole. It is obvious that the Russo brothers had a plan because it is obvious that they paid attention to details and some smaller moments that real fans will easily recognize. Of course I have some objections that are related to certain characters and some scenes, but given the type of film and how much the film offers, I can just get over it and forget about it. I think this Marvel project is unrepeatable and it's something we should appreciate no matter what you think of movies like this.",9

Fantastic but too long,24 April 2020,"Good story. Exciting battle. Marvel fans mustn't have been spoiled before watching this. But it may be not so friendly to newcomers. If the 181 minutes were full of excitements that would be definitely ok but actually there're a significant amount of quiet and peaceful moments, puzzling people who watch Marvel film for the first time. I don't know how would a Marvel fan judge them.",9
Ying and yang,2 October 2019,"Seems that they separated every good parts and put them in Infinity Wars and leftovers into this one. Plot is ridiculous, with most of the heroes unused/underused. Are those actors even involved in making of this movie? It is more like clip show episode, made of chaotic parts from previous Avengers, where even CGI quality is different or in the worst case, they combine new things into old scenes, so difference in quality is even more obvious.

Time will lower rating of this movie when hype stop. Now, this movie is first one in All time worldwide gross, so it will be more criticized (Avatar can rest now).

I watched it in full cinema in first days of screening. We laughed on stupidity of some scenes (every one in theater). At the end, on exit, after 3 hours of painfully boring and bad movie, nobody talked about it... Just wanted to leave this misery behind it.",6

First half is a bit slow, but still interesting, with all the small pieces coming together. Second part is full time action, almost as good as Infinity Wars, but a bit weaker in details. I do miss more of Dr. Strange more, but, on the other hand, Captain America was much better than expected. Humor was good, as always.

Overall, this is a great movie and a decent ending to the saga. I think everyone will be satisfied.",8
GREAT...GREATER...GREATEST...,29 April 2024,"""Avengers: Endgame"" is a monumental conclusion to over a decade of storytelling in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, the film serves as the culmination of numerous character arcs and storylines that have been building since the inception of the MCU.

From a technical standpoint, ""Endgame"" is a marvel (pun intended) of modern filmmaking. The visual effects are stunning, seamlessly blending CGI with live-action footage to create epic battle sequences and breathtaking cosmic landscapes. The action is intense and well-choreographed, keeping audiences on the edge of their seats throughout its nearly three-hour runtime.

However, what truly sets ""Endgame"" apart is its emotional depth and character development. The film explores themes of loss, sacrifice, redemption, and the importance of teamwork in the face of overwhelming odds. It's not just a superhero spectacle; it's a deeply human story about flawed individuals coming together to do whatever it takes to save the universe.

The performances from the ensemble cast are exceptional across the board. Robert Downey Jr. Delivers a poignant and memorable performance as Tony Stark/Iron Man, Chris Evans brings gravitas to the role of Steve Rogers/Captain America, and Scarlett Johansson shines as Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow. The entire cast, including newcomers like Brie Larson as Carol Danvers/Captain Marvel, brings their A-game, making each character feel fully realized and relatable.

One of the film's greatest strengths is its ability to balance epic action with quieter, more intimate moments. It's not afraid to slow down and let characters reflect on their journey and the choices they've made. These quieter scenes are just as impactful as the big set pieces, adding depth and emotional resonance to the story.

""Avengers: Endgame"" is a fitting conclusion to the Infinity Saga, providing satisfying closure to long-running storylines while also setting the stage for the future of the MCU. It's a love letter to fans who have invested years in these characters and their adventures, delivering a cinematic experience that is both epic in scale and deeply personal.",10

Could of been more by being less,1 May 2019,"I'm a huge fan of long slow-crawl movies (cue LOTR trilogy) but the first half of this culminating slog was way too slow and artificially melodramatic. This is in stark contrast to Infinity War's well edited, if not somewhat fractured fast paced scenes.

If anything Infinity War could of used an extra 20min of dialogue and slower pacing edited out of Endgame. In the end, still a fun movie but not without obvious pacing flaws.",8
What next for the MCU? Suggestions!,22 June 2019,"Loved Endgame but with a lukewarm feeling for The Eternals and Shang Chi on the horizon, I wondered whether the MCU should make more logical choices for the next phase. Obviously there are development issues with the FF and X-Men franchises and DC's Aquaman may well scupper a potential Sub-Mariner movie, but perhaps these would work:

1) Captain Britain (we heard 'Braddock' mentioned by Peggy Carter in Endgame; Brian's father perhaps?) 2) Alpha Flight. With the Avengers having run their course, perhaps their Canadian counterparts could step up. It stands to reason that other countries would want to copy the Avengers model (I know they are the Earth's protectors but they pretty much belong to the USA). 3) Moon Knight. Although I would love to see Daredevil done right on the big screen, maybe Marc Spector could fill the void. 4) Silver Surfer. Norrin Radd was the best thing about the FF sequel. A space-based movie would give him room to soar. Look to GotG or the Ron Lim Thanos issues of Silver Surfer for inspiration. 5) Ka-Zar. Although often perceived as a Tarzan rip-off, Lord Kevin Plunder's exploits could open up a whole new playground with the Savage Land.

I wonder if we'll look back in 10 years and see if any of these came to pass...!",8
"Amazing, dont blame fans when they say marvel is not marvel after Endgame",27 September 2023,"""Avengers: Endgame"" soars into the cinematic stratosphere with an 8/10 rating, and I absolutely loved it. The film is a monumental achievement in storytelling and blockbuster filmmaking. The acting from the ensemble cast, including Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, and Scarlett Johansson, is top-notch, delivering emotional and powerful performances. The film's editing expertly weaves together multiple storylines and character arcs, making its three-hour runtime feel like a sprint. The strength of ""Endgame"" lies in its ability to deliver a satisfying conclusion to over a decade of storytelling while still introducing thrilling new elements. The weakness? Well, it might be a bit overwhelming for those not well-versed in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The music enhances every epic moment, and the cinematography captures both the grandeur of the battles and the intimacy of the character interactions. Above all, ""Endgame"" carries a profound message about sacrifice, resilience, and the enduring power of hope. This is superhero cinema at its absolute finest.",8

"slighty awkward or boring at times, slow dialog, some cool stuff",22 August 2019,"Unfortunately clumsy. I enjoyed all previous Avengers, and a few scenes in this are very cool and funny, but this one lowers the bar overall. For me the story petered out instead of maintained momentum from previous movies. The dialogue struggles to be interesting, boring sequences at time.

Clumsy Avengers fit awkwardly together for group photo, like bad high school reunion. That said, I enjoy Avengers like everyone else for years, just not this one so much.

The super-power woman, Capt Marvel, her powers are overdone. Too simplistic, too much power. No reason for her to lose any fight.

Was a big collective of all heroes even necessary? Sort of not really.

Some scenes linger way too long, drawing out already thin content. And where was Dr Strange? He hardly had anything to say, and very brief appearance, yet he was in possession of crucial aspect of story.",6
A great ending to a wonderful 10 years saga.,16 October 2019,"Endgame is certainly one of its kind. A movie that will be marked as the film of this decade. Building up from Iron Man to Captain Marvel, a 10 journey filled with joy, adventure and tears. And we need a perfect ending to all of that. Endgame is the perfect ending. A movie that has everything a fan will ever dream of, an amazing cast and a wonderful climax. It is such a huge payoff from 10 years worth of building up. To look at this from a Fan's perspective, it is an awesome movie and it is a masterpiece. But to look at this from a critic's perspective, it is not the best movie. It certainly lacks some elements to a perfect movie. But this to me, is such a wonderful movie and I definitely loved it. It has everything I wanted and I'm gonna give this movie a 9/10.",9
Nice ending,26 April 2019,"For a Marvel movie it was ok, better than most. However this has no place being higher ranked than Schindler's list, Pulp Fiction, Fight Club, Forrest Gump, Every Kubrick movie ever made and many more. People should take of their Marvel fanboy hats and stop shoving these movies to the top. I'm not saying you shouldn't enjoy them, but stop inflating the reviews just based on the fact that you grew up with the characters and judge them on the movie itself.",6
Fell at the last hurdle,15 May 2019,"I watch all films with an open mind and went into this 3 hour long film without any preconceptions.

This film really let itself down. The writers completely changed some of the characters, they tried to make it funny and failed at every attempt where it was cringe worthy and boring. The story was dragged out to its limit and went on for way to long.

Don't waste your money at the cinema, maybe Google the outcome.",2
An Epic Apex of Comic Book Films,29 April 2024,"Just over 5 years ago, the culmination of the first 3 phases of The MCU came to a head with Avengers: Endgame. This was one of the biggest Cinematic events to ever take place and with it hitting its 5 year anniversary, I thought I would give it a rewatch and here is my review for the film. The premise of the film sees the world in turmoil after the events of Avengers: Infinity War, with one last chance to make things right, The Avengers reunite to take on their biggest challenge.

Main Character Robert Downey Jr as Tony Stark was the real start of this whole cinematic universe and he is brilliant in this film. He really delivers a strong performance, you see how the events of the previous film really affects him and motivates him to come to terms and once again become Iron man. He still has the funny quips and narcissism that made his character famous which is great.

Chris Evans is back as Steve Rogers and similarly he does a great job with this iconic role. He has great chemistry with Downey & Scarlett Johansson and I thought this film did a great job putting him back in the spotlight and having him being an emotional centre of the film.

Supporting Characters Now this might be the largest cast in film history, so I will definitely miss some people out but everybody delivers on their performances and really bring the comic book characters to the cinema screen.

Mark Ruffalo reprises his role as Bruce Banner and I actually liked the direction they take his character in this film. They make him a more enjoyable character to watch and it is really good seeing The Hulk getting a bit more time to shine after missing for the majority of the previous film.

Scarlett Johansson plays Natasha Romanoff and they really did some really good work with her character of Black Widow. She really struggles with the weight that comes with being one of the leaders of The Avengers who failed and Johansson is strong in her role here.

Chris Hemsworth is back as Thor and after the events of Infinity War he is really the character that is effected in a really interesting way. The film handles his failures in a way that I don't think anyone could have expected and it is handled well with Thor developing a lot during the film.

After missing Infinity War, Jeremy Renner & Paul Rudd are back as Clint Barton & Scott Lang respectively. The film really focuses on the issues that Barton has gone through since the events of the previous film and it is pretty dark and easy to relate too. Paul Rudd is mostly used for comic relief but is a lot of fun and when he needs to deliver some more dramatic scenes he is good at that too.

Don Cheadle gets more screen time as Rhodey and does a good job, Karen Gillan is given her best work yet as Nebula and Thanos played by Josh Brolin is a great villain, though he is clearly not the most important character like he was in Infinity War.

Story The story is great, it really fits the drama and feeling of a world in disarray after what happened in the previous film and the performances delivered on it. Despite having lots of characters and lots of story beats to hit, it really delivers on it and has twists and turns that wouldn't be expected and really drive it up. There is plenty of comic book film fun though and the last act of the film is pure cinema and an experience unlike any other, especially for fans of these films that have been watching since the beginning.

Script This film actually feels a little different to others in the MCU in that it is more serious. It realises the situation that the characters are in and realises it has to be a bit more serious and have these characters have emotional issues and I am glad they went in this direction. The film does have plenty of humour though and these people are naturally funny which does help.

Style The film has great action sequences, there is a lot of green screen and CGI but it looks great throughout and the way they managed to make the film seem really epic is through this. The film is 3 hours long but it really doesn't feel like it, it is paced really well and allows the audience to be invested in the story.

Overall Overall, Avengers: Endgame is one of my favourite films. Being a huge fan of Marvel, this felt like the apex of what could be achieved and the fact that everybody involved nailed it so well made it a truly special event and one that needs to be seen.

End game without a proper ending,30 April 2019,There are so many ways that the movie could have gone. But it is chosen to be this way. So the climax should not be criticised. The story is completed with no proper explanation for the rest of the avengers. Other avengers are not given importance in most of the places. Don't go to the movie if you know the spoilers. My experience has been spoiled by my friends.,9
If it wouldnt be SO ridiculous at some points...,24 April 2019,,9
A bit of a mess to be honest,26 April 2019,,7
Perfect ending for an amazing series,24 April 2019,"This movie past over and beyond any expectation. Don't miss watching it..... will definitely watch it again and again. ""Endgame"" The name fits perfectly. Total respect",10
Not As Good As Infinity War,24 September 2023,"But its a pretty good film. A bit of a mess in some parts, lacking the cohesive and effortless feel infinity war somehow managed to accomplish. Some silly plot holes and characters that could've been cut (Ahem, captain marvel and thanos). The use of Captain marvel in this film was just ridiculous. Shes there at the start, bails for some reason? And then pops up at the end to serve no purpose but deux ex machina a space ship...

The past thanos part wasn't necessary when you think about it, they could've done this film without a real 'villain' And it would've worked and been a original take on a super hero film without using the same formula we have seen in 10+ super hero films already. The entire final battle felt like a rehashed messy battle, with a bunch more characters against thanos - basically mixing the space battle from infinity war; iron man, spider man etc and the final battle of infinity war with captain america, thor etc.. mashing those two into one within this new film. The scenes of trying to pull the gauntlet off his hand.. it all felt like a rehash.

To me the best part of the film was the first act and half of the second, when everyone is lost and trying to figure out how to continue on. Really interesting themes that followed the pay off from infinity wars ending. And then the time heist part. Tho the heist part should've been much more stretched out. With only small parts of thanos within that, and not having him be the big bad again. But just a side character that gets in the way a little bit.

And the setting up for 'new avengers' to replace the beloved actors and characters we have come to associate with these films.. they do not get me at all excited for the next phase in marvel films. Falcon, Valkyrie, blackpanther, cap marvel? I just dont care about them at all. And their actors lack any charisma or depth.

To me this feels like a closing of marvel films that I'll really enjoy for my pop corn fix. I've given infinity war a 10/10 and some of the stand alone films 8's and 9's. But I have a sinking feeling this will not be happening in the future except the guardians of the galaxy films.",7
Waste of time!!!,3 September 2019,,3
Overrated.,30 April 2019,"Well overrated. I expected better, the previous one was better.",
Avengers: Endgame (2019),26 April 2019,"The Marvel Cinematic Universe comes to a point where a film feels like an actual event. We have been waiting in anticipation for a year to see the final showdown that started in Infinity War. Actually, scratch that. The entire Infinity Saga started way back with Iron Man. 22 films, countless number of heroes coming together in the culminating battle against Thanos. So much anticipation, ticketing app crashes, and going through so much to try to see this on opening night. Now here we are. Does Avengers: Endgame live up to its high expectations? Absolutely. I felt like it was unique and carries the most emotional weight off anything in this universe but it absolutely serves its fans who have been loyal for years and years.

The film takes place three weeks after the end of Infinity War. Half of the worlds population have been wiped out by Thanos and now the remaining Avengers (who just so happen to consist summarily of the original Avengers) must find a way to not only defeat Thanos, but also avenge the fallen and find a way to counteract the actions that occurred at the end of Infinity War. As expected the film stars a gigantic cast of Hollywood's best and watch out for the cameos from heroes who have appeared previously in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

I really would like to talk about this film in a spoiler review but as with every review on my site, there will be no spoilers. I will say that this film has a unique take almost immediately. The humor and banter is still there as it always is and the character arcs are as fantastic as ever at its near completion. The film carries the most emotional weight as anything this universe has seen. The film has so much fan service. I think if you go early on and with a packed crowd of fans you will see just how much this means to the audience who have stayed loyal to this saga.

There were laughs, there were cheers, there were gasps, and yes there were tears. The film feels like it should be the very last that the MCU has to offer but of course we know there are Spider-Man and Black Panther sequels coming. The final battle brings just about everything you could hope for. If you're a fan of the series I think you will enjoy this film as it makes a case of being the best Avengers film. It goes hand in hand with Infinity War, of course both films were shot together.

Members of the original Avengers put on performances that do their characters the utmost justice after being on this journey for a decade. The film builds up quite slowly but once the plot takes form and the battle lines are drawn it delivers in the way the Russo brothers know how to. Th action is there, and all of what makes the Marvel Universe such a sweeping phenomenon is always there. Some characters could get more screen time, sure. You have to remember that there are so many characters that the film has to juggle and it does that admirably as it is.

The film will be a box office hit for sure and will be well reviewed in regards to the Universe as I can already see. I will be seeing this again tomorrow morning and have the same excitement going into a second viewing as I did my first. I found this to be a very special entry and feel like it ties up so much in such a perfect fashion. If you are a fan of superhero fans you need to see this as soon as possible and should do..

Whatever it takes.

3 hours just flew by,25 April 2019,"Absolutely loved it, every character gets a good chunk of screen time and they all use it to full effect, its laugh out loud funny at times, really touching at times.",10
Meandering badly pace and mediocre movie,24 April 2019,"The first 50 minutes set up the movie very well but the second act lacks urgency and focus. The movie comes to a halt and feels as if it's meandering between scenes, not knowing what to do and not being very entertaining. The movie is also highly predictable and somewhat ruins Thanos's character due to a strange character decision. Iron man is given a lot to work with, which is compelling, same with Hawkeye. The ending is somewhat satisfying but also cringe. Overall it is a fine movie, not offensively bad but certainly not as good as it's predecessor.",9
Infinity War is way better!!,4 May 2019,I didn't like the acting. Thanos doesn't seem like the badass of the first movie,8
Too Much Over/Under Reviews,29 August 2019,"Hurts to be a fan and say something like this. Avengers: Endgame is a movie that takes too long to mesh, forcing a situation of drama that does not convince in many parts. Practically 2/3 hours of film with many unnecessary dialogues and misdirected performances. The plot holes and bad decisions of the writers is quite evident, except for those who do not expect much from a movie that should end a fantastic universe era built over eleven years. Even so, it has it's high points in 1/3 - great moments, solid acting, and so much fan service. It's a pity that's not in the same level of Avengers: Infinity War at all, but is an 'Ok movie' and don't deserves 10/10 and 1/1 rates.",6
An end to rule all ends.,24 April 2019,"Definitely not as good as its predecessor but one to be conjured with nevertheless. The movie starts a bit slower than all MCU movies before it and it takes its precious time to get the action going, but once it does, its all forgiven and forgotten. Although predictable, because let's face it, where could they go after Infinity Wars? It delivers on all fronts! There were tears and laughter throughout the 3 hr long feature. The tears yanked out of you by Ant Man, Stark, Cap and Hawkeye and the laughter mainly by Thor who surprised everybody with his transformation, but also by Hulk/Banner who found a peaceful way to co-exist. There were cameos sprinkled throughout the whole length of the movie, some very emotional, like Agent Carter, who actually didn't have to say a single word to get the tears flowing. They tied up all the loose ends, revisited some great scenes from past beloved movies and, thankfully, did not give all the glory to insipid Captain Marvel, who despite being the most powerful of all the Avengers, delivers quite a forgettable performance. There are some key characters who will definitely not be coming back, but there is still plenty left for future plots. Although it will feel a lot less exciting with some of the most beloved characters absent from now on.

All considered, a very good movie to end it all, one that you may want to watch it again to take it all in as I will be doing. Well done to all involved and a great big thank you for such a ride that spanned for over 10 years.",10

Perfection,24 April 2019,This movie has the absolute perfect balance of fan service and harsh moments. Lean into the tears and suspend a little disbelief. This movie is everything we needed and more than we deserved.,10
"Great ""ending"" to a saga",17 August 2019,"Endgame is a great popcorn action movie to ""finish"" a saga of popcorn action movies. This isn't serious entertainment and shouldn't be considered as such, and it reminds me of how George Lucas made Star Wars as an homage to the cheap serials like Flash Gordon. Especially as comic-sourced material, this is what the MCU is. Some part of me is actually a bit pained to like it as much as I do, given that it is just playing on base emotions to make money for a massive conglomerate like Disney.

BUT... what a great way to end several major storylines that they invested in over the past 11 years. For people who have watched the saga, I feel like this is just the cherry on the top. My only complaint is something that you can't really get away from in superhero stories: the character ""powers"" are totally inconsistent from scene to scene, and movie to movie. This is a trope that there's no getting away from, because if characters like Captain Marvel, Thor, Scarlet Witch, and Hulk were always as powerful as they show flashes of, then the story wouldn't even be a thing. Any one of them could destroy Thanos in the blink of an eye, and have done similar feats in other stories (and even in other scenes within a given story). That they sometimes ""reduce"" their power to a lower level, without an explained mechanism, is pretty laughable, and makes some parts of the story a bit nonsensical. Yes, this constant Ex Machina is needed to maintain the drama and keep the plot going, but it's still something that takes me out of the story.

What I really love about this movie, and the saga as a whole, is how good it is at developing the actual characters and their relationships. There are some similarities, but nobody is the same, and most of the arcs are believable. Thor's story, and apparent PTSD, is to me the best-done, but all of the majors (and some of the minors) are almost as good. I believed them. And for a popcorn action movie saga based on a comic series, I think that's a pretty high compliment.",8
A Masterpiece,8 August 2019,"Wow there are so many troll reviews by inarticulate rubes who can't even explain their opinions.

People are entitled to their own tastes, and the super hero genre of the Marvel variety that is a pastiche of action/adventure, sci-fi, and fantasy doesn't appeal to everyone, but for what it is, for what it succeeds at being for its target audience, Avengers: Endgame is currently the benchmark as a satisfying grand finale in a cinematic universe.

There can be no doubt that Infinity War and Endgame are masterpieces. That doesn't mean they're the best movies ever made, or that they're better than other masterpieces of different genres, it just means that it succeeds in every element required of it.

The barrier of entry to The Avengers, especially the last two films, is quite high and requires someone to watch a lot of movies, and without an investment in those characters in the Marvel film that lead up to Infinity War and Endgame, a casual viewer will not care the same way a fan will. Yet that shouldn't detract from how skillfully the writers and directors manage to balance so many elements and fuse so many genres to deliver a unique piece of pop-entertainment that is full of humor, spectacle, and drama.

The Avengers is not a particularly profound franchise. It doesn't attempt to be allegorical like The Lord of The Rings, it isn't as mind-expanding as The Matrix, it isn't as mystical as the original Star Wars, nor does it make any social commentary like The Dark Knight, but it has plenty of great archetypal characters who embody different aspects and struggles with heroism. Each character plays so well off the other and the cast has so much chemistry.

No other franchise understands its characters better than Marvel, and no writers have a better grasp of heroic conflict and camaraderie than Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely. Comparing their work in Endgame to other franchises like the DCU's Justice League or the current Star Wars is night and day.

That isn't to say Endgame is perfect. A Masterpiece doesn't have to be perfect, and most aren't. Certain elements of the plot feel rushed and loopholes are glossed over. Not all the jokes land, but most are pretty funny. Captain Marvel is way too powerful which constantly makes her a Deus Ex Machina. There are any combination of nitpicky observations I could make about parts that don't exactly make sense, but those are minor.

Admittedly, I do have a bit of Marvel fatigue after this. It almost feels like Endgame was so epic that I don't ever need to see another super hero movie again. Sure, I'll probably see the new Spider-Man, and even though I really like the films and the character, it's reaching a point of over-saturation.",9
Amazing but hearth wrenching,18 December 2021,"Endgame has such a special place in my heart, it's so beautiful, but at the same time so painful to watch. The storyline is overall amazing and the characters is so amazing. Everything about this movie is incredible. This movie has it all , those cute comforting scenes, action scenes and fights, those scenes when you just can't stop crying it has it all. Endgame is such an experience. This movie is and I think will always be the turning point of marvel.",10

Just not as great as I had hoped.,28 April 2019,"A bit like a compilation album, some really great tracks but generally just filler. Cinematically it was epic, spectacular, CGI filled superhero awesomeness but the film was slow to start (after a brilliant emotional first 15 mins) and I was mostly underwhelmed by the plot. I felt Thor was ruined by the joke and some parts were just cameos for the sake of it. I did sob with my son at the saddest part, but I still feel a bit... meh.... maybe I need to watch it again to see if it's better second time around!",6

Great acting but worst marvel movie Ever,19 December 2020,First of all story writing is lazy and the time travel is f**cked up (No understanding of time lines and the effects) and is sickening 😨😓 and dreadful. Wanted to say but I ain't gat time to waste on this pathetic movie.,
"Everything led to this, and it was perfectly done",26 April 2019,"After what happened in Infinity war, the only question I had was ""how can they top that?"" That question was answered, no other superhero movie will be able to beat Endgame. The movie just gets better and better and the huge finale is done spectacularly and has everything you want to see and much, much more. The set up for this was perfect, the build up to this was perfect, and the pay off was perfect. Avengers: Endgame is done flawlessly and perfectly.",10
i used to cry after infinite war after endgame hmm not rly.,30 April 2019,,8
Is it a great film? Does it matter?,25 April 2019,"No one goes to see a comic book movie expecting to see an art house film. It happens sometimes but it is not the normal. What you expect to see is a fun movie with some philosophical concept and some emotional depth, comic books were never just about the action. So is this a great film? I don't care. Watching it I never stopped to think if there are plot holes or if the cinematography is good, I just enjoyed it. And enjoyed almost everything about it. The Russo brothers are not the new Goddard or the new Bergman (or even the new Spielberg) but they are talented and intellectual people, they had a goal and they delivered by not only doing fan service but also story service. The MCU has a great future.

So, is it a great film? Comparing it with cinematic masterpieces I could give it a 6-7/10. Comparing it with other blockbuster movies I could give it a 12/10, it's that good...",9
Every single moment is unexpected,24 April 2019,"Everyone shines in this movie. Directed to the fans of these 10 last years of Marvel movies. A thank you, beautiful, tragic, fun. The emotion stills my words just after seeing the movie. Have to see it twice again to do it justice.",10

2.5 hours of dramas and flashbacks torture with 30 min of action,4 May 2019,"Nowadays it is like a crime to say bad things against Marvel movies but someone has to tell the truth This movie is extremely over-hyped. The first 2 hours there was almost no action, it was unnecessary endless dialogs, flashbacks and seconds chances. When we thought we gonna see some action, it took 30 min only. And then back to aftermath dramas again. I like dramas and deep stories in the movies but we already know these characters stories. why to over-extend that much? Acting was empty and going nowhere, CGI was almost none since there was a limited action. If it was up to me i would wait for torrents buy my gf wanted to see so much and in the end she also got disappointed.",
Epic.. yes! Phenomenal.. Yes! Amazing.. yes! But better from infinity war? Don't think so!,12 January 2020,This movie was really good. I remember my self screaming at the movies sooooo bad along with every other fan! I watched this movie 2 times at the cinema! It was something else! But still something was missing! I don't know what but I gotta say that infinity war was superior! At least for me!,8
"Amazing, IW is still better.",5 May 2019,"It could definitely be improved, but every possible flaw can be totally overlooked because of the 22 film build-up, it seems earned completely for every joke that doesn't land (which isn't many) there are a hundred fan-service moments that make you forget any wrongdoing Following up such an airtight film like Infinity War would be superbly difficult, making the 11 years feel worth it is an achievement and The Russo Brothers deserve praise.",10

What an ending,25 April 2019,"What a brilliant finale to a wonderful saga, the infinity war saga will surely go down as one of the great cinematic achievements of all time.

Meh,23 June 2019,"After all the hype, I expected to be extremely wowed. But I left feeling kind of meh. It was extremely long and dragged in several places. I felt like Infinity War was better overall. Good movie but seriously overhyped.",7
The End is Part of the Journey.,27 April 2019,"I have never wrote a review about any movie I watch. I just feel that I have to document what just touched my heart. Growing up in the Middle East, specifically in Saudi Arabia, without cinema was hard for me. I remember I used to wait months after the movie comes out to watch it online. When I was in college, I used to travel to Bahrain to watch Marvel movies. I enjoyed watching all the movies. I have developed a strong connection with all the characters. I feel what they feel, I understand what they understand. It became a part of my life. My friends, even my close friends, used to make fun of me for watching superheroes movies. They always say that there is no story it is all CGI, what are you watching it for? They do not understand the creativity of developing characters and flashbacks, let alone understanding a complex plot with many planets and universes. I am so happy that I made it to the U.S and watched the movie in the opening day. With that said, Avengers: Endgame is one of the most epic movies I have ever seen. I laughed too loud, cried too hard, and smiled a lot. I will not write any spoilers, I am not that guy, but I wanted to share some of the feelings that I experienced in these epic three hours. The movie has everything perfect the writing, acting, and directing are all outstanding. If there is one wish that I could have in life is that watching this movie with someone I love who have the same admiration for Marvel movies. To the creators, actors and actresses, people behind the scene, and everyone participated in creating it I cannot thank you enough for what you have done. I know this is not a perfect review but I had to share it somehow.",10
Don't believe all the hype!,7 May 2019,"Spoiler free..... For those who have given this a 10, take that with a pinch of salt, it really isn't. There's a strong argument that suggests infinity war was an overall better film. Endgame drags in places as it tries to cram in so much more, building up to a noteably predictable ending. The direction some of the characters have taken this time around is polarising and didn't work for me. Some key MCU characters going forward we're also given limited screen time which, for those keen to know what the future holds.. I'm not sure anyone really knows now.

Whilst the changing of the guard will be welcomed you do get a sense of, this is really the end of a great journey for marvel. Barring a series of solo follows ups and a play in the tv series space we're unlikely to see an avengers style films of this magnitude anytime soon!

I've always been a fan ever since the iron man graced our screens, however for me, they have slipped up quite a few times along the way (Thor series) was poor and captain marvel was average.",6
A complete let down...,29 April 2019,,2
"Worst Marvel movie in long time. Boring, boring,,snooze fest",1 May 2019,"Wow! What a POS movie...So much talking. So much crying.. So much boring no action garbage. These high scores must be paid off. Don't believe the reviews. Stopped watching in one hour..and yes that first hour was painful. I can't imagine fighting thru another two hours. What a shocker. A three hour movie that stinks. Who's idea is it to make movies three hours?!?! Most of them are garbage.

Skip this at all costs",
"Absolutely amazing, but still flawed.",8 May 2019,"After waiting for a year, Avengers: Endgame hit the theatres and shattered a number of box office records worldwide. But, was it really so perfectly great? No.

Good : The first thing I loved about this movie was that it was the most character driven film in the MCU till date. In particular, Hawkeye and Black Widow got the most of character shine. And, it didn't have much of Captain Marvel. As someone who feels awkward when she comes on screen, it was a good thing. It did a great job of serving the fans. So many crowd pleasing moments! I was literally jumping and whistling when I was watching this film, literally. The third act is full of those moments. Those moments do come along with really good character background, a story and excitement. All of these do not make complete sense, but at least they weren't blant. And, many parts are quite nostalgic. It has tried it's best to give every character a proper arc. Performances are incredible. I didn't even hate Don Cheadle in this movie. On the whole, it was insanely entertaining and has ridiculous amount of great moments to say the least.

Mixed : It's not a spoiler to say it's a time travel film. While this plot device served a lot to give us a lot of crowd pleasing moments, each of which I really loved, the whole time travel part could've been even more epic and exciting than it was. There were parts in Infinity War where it jumped from plotline to plotline. This one does the same, but it looked more choppy here. Not necessarily a bad thing, a movie of this scale would have such problems. But it was a bit more distracting than before. I admit I liked many arcs given to the characters. But, they were still a bit illogical, in particular that of Steve Rogers. Many things were entertaining as hell, but still quite paradoxical.

Bad : It's a time travel movie. It generates a lot many plot holes and inconsistencies. It uses time travel as an excuse for getting certain things done. It has the most generic issues of a non sci-fi time travel movie. The timeline surely is messed up now. I don't know how the time travel in this universe works and how certain things were amended due to all of these time travelling stuffs. May be I will never know. And Thanos. He was treated more like a mustache twirling villain, rather than how he was in Infinity War. The way his character ended was the most disappointing part of the movie. It feels as if it tries to be as big as Infinity War while it clearly isn't.

Conclusion : You can and must watch this film. It's a film by the Russo Brothers, you can definitely count on them for an entertaining film, but this is perhaps their weakest film in the MCU. It isn't well paced as Infinity War is, but still gives all the moments you can wish for. Infinity War is a whole lot better than this film, but is still a worth watching flick. If you stop thinking about the inconsistencies time travel creates in this film, this will be a much better experience.

Rating.

A good ending to a great saga Loved the acting and direction was superb but the length of the movie was tediously long. the movie fails to keep the tempo. The character arch of some were strangely distorted. overall a great movie. loved the ending. Tony Stark, Captain America, thor, Hulk, Black widow and Hawkeye will always remain in our hearts.",8
The Saga's conclusion is complex and satisfying,11 April 2024,"It must be admitted, the Russo Brothers are really good at covering up all the secrets for the film Avengers: Endgame. In fact, the spoiler scenes that were spread on social media didn't seem to have a big impact. Joe and Anthony Russo know what they're getting into with all of this. They want this ultimate conflict to be so complex.

Avengers: Endgame truly works as a blockbuster movie experience. If you empathize with the difficulties faced by the remaining Avengers after the events leading up to and including Infinity War, you will be satisfied with this film.

The duration of three hours which initially felt too long was no joke. In fact, almost every minute is well spent, except for a few comedic scenes that could have been left for the Blu-Ray version. The film Avengers: Endgame managed to tie up the entire MCU story with a beautiful, emotional, heart-wrenching and hopeful conclusion which is an undeniable achievement.

As good as it is, there are still flaws even though they can be forgiven. Because the plot is dense and there is a lot to tell, some things seem a little messy. There is some questionable logic and raises many questions, including the ending of the film. In fact, it slightly breaks the established rules of all the MCU films before this one. However, despite that, the film is an emotional and satisfying journey.",8

Practically Perfect,7 May 2019,"This movie was incredible, it did everything I wanted it to do and every character had their time to shine, the film was the culmination of 22 MCU films and ten years of buildup and the film pulled it off beautifully. This film could have turned out as a mess if it was in the wrong hands, but the Russo brothers have masterfully pulled off an awesome and emotionally satisfying finale to the Avengers franchise and MCU series even though we are getting more films with ""Spider-Man: A Long Way From Home"" coming out later this year

Overall, the film was everything it needed to be and the hefty 3 hour run time was definitely more than necessary. The film did everything I expected and much much more, closing a chapter on pop culture history and a franchise loved by billions, it was as close to perfect as a film like this can get",10

Eh,28 April 2019,Infinity War was way better. Endgame is super slow and even at times pretty boring. The third act somehow misses the mark and falls short of being the epic finale we've all been waiting for. Overall it was okay. It wasn't horrible. Definitely not the best either.,6

Oozes woke,3 August 2019,"One just gets the sense that this movie took a subtle yet noticeable shift away from what captured many people's hearts in the earlier MCU movies.

The actors give off the feeling of being forced to portray a role that used to be natural fits in order to impose various woke messages. There are so many but they come at a rate of every couple of minutes, ranging from blatant grrl power, to emasculation and so on. Muddling along.

Aside from the odd action scenes, this movie could pass as a drama.",
Great Ending For Avengers,28 April 2019,,9
I don't know how to feel about this one...,27 April 2019,"I've been a fan of superheroes since I was little kid. When Iron Man was out, I couldn't believe it, it was so good. But, I completely fell in love with the idea of the MCU when I watched Captain America: The First Avenger. Here we are, 10 years later, 10 years loving fictional characters, loving the actors, loving the movies, to have it ending like... well this.

I think they had a great idea, a great way of saying goodbye to the most beloved characters, but I think the movie fell short. I was more emotional during the ending credits than the whole movie. I felt like I needed more, like there was many things left unsaid. Maybe I'll love it the second time I watched it? I don't know honestly, for now, I am a bit disappointed with this one.",8

A masterpiece really,3 May 2019,"The film once again managed to include all emotions, just like infinity war did. At the beginning it was not what I was expecting, and from I've gathered this has caused many people to disregard the whole film, but the fact they tried something different makes it unique. The film still reached a point where the whole tone flipped and this is where it became even better. This is the only film I have been to see that has made the audience applaud, that must show how these films have been able to create such a connection with the MCU community to the characters.",10
An over-gloryfied MCU clip show...,30 April 2019,"I'll keep it as short as possible and spoiler free, I didn't expect this movie to be better than Infinity War but it was a disappointment, unfortunately... The cons first: a) This movie is almost an MCU clip show. I won't spoil the plot but to me it felt repetitive. Like eating reheated pizza. b) Too slow. Do you remember the action sequences and the fast pace of Infinity War? Forget that. Literaly there's almost no action for the first one hour and a half! c) Dispropotional screen time. Unlike infinity War, the majority of superheroes have too little screen time (I'm talking about fighting scenes). Again, I can't spoil anything but some heroes have two or three lines and a ten second action scene. d) Thanos himself. Unfortunatelly Thanos wasn't as good (or should I say... bad) as he was in Infinity War, he almost feels like a heavy bag with a few lines (and I mean few). e) Predictable plot (maybe that's only me). f) The final big battle feels hasty and bad edited. There are too much going on on screen with a very little time for each character. g) It has a pessimistic and dark tone. Now the pros: a) Solid conclusion. The movie is a solid conclusion of MCU's phase 3 (and perhaps MCU itself). b) Good humor. That's not a surprise for a Marvel movie, there's plenty of tasteful humor and in the correct amount. c) Good performances. Nothing to add here. d) No political agendas. I hate it when it happens and thankfully this movie is ok (there are one or two cringeworthy scenes though, but nothing importand). e) There are some good action scenes and the effects are awesome. Overall, it felt rushed and it lacks the majestic feeling of Infinity War. I can remember plenty of scenes in Infinity War which gave me goosebumps, unfortunately there's none in Endgame... Final verdict: 6/10 when I compare it to Infinity War (it's unavoidable), 7/10 as a stand-alone MCU film. In my opinion it's the third best Avengers movie (right below Infinity War and the first one). I didn't regret watching it at the theater, in fact I suggest you to do it, but I won't watch it a second time...",6
Avengers: Endgame,4 December 2023,"""Avengers: Endgame"" is the culmination of a decade of blockbuster filmmaking, the result of years of work from thousands of people. It is designed to be the most blockbuster of all the blockbusters, a movie with a dozen subplots colliding, and familiar faces from over 20 other movies. It's really like nothing that Hollywood has produced before, existing not just to acknowledge or exploit the fans of this series, but to reward their love, patience, and undying adoration. The blunt thing you probably want to know most: It's hard to see serious MCU fans walking away from this disappointed. It checks all the boxes, even ticking off a few ones that fans won't expect to be on the list. It's a satisfying end to a chapter of blockbuster history that will be hard to top for pure spectacle. In terms of sheer entertainment value, it's on the higher end of the MCU, a film that elevates its most iconic heroes to the legendary status they deserve and provides a few legitimate thrills along the way.",9

Wonderful Movie,16 July 2019,"A perfect film in everything, never boring and a wonderful ending",10
Amazing Movie,10 May 2020,"This movie concludes 22 movies over a span of 11 years. This journey has been a emotional roller coaster, starting from Iron Man in 2008. Endgame properly complements its predecessor Infinity War. This is made by people who do, for people who do, and this movie itself, does, love the MCU. You can think of it as a finale. After 22 movies that are all feature length.. Where the equally masterful Infinity War was almost one long action climax, this is less about fights. Which doesn't mean it doesn't have any. Or that they're anything less than excellent. And this film is definitely never boring. This focuses on character exploration. Every member of the original Avengers team, and a handful individuals that aren't, all get significant depth. In this movie everyone is pushed into a situation new to them. The trailers hint at some of these, whilst leaving others as incredible surprises. It amazes me how such a large cast was accommodated pretty well in the movie. If you are a Marvel fan make sure you carry tissues with yourself. Russo Brothers have done a great job. It's got a lot of fun action. The action scenes were good the movie has some events which kept it from becoming predictable. There were many stories which kept it exciting. I liked the bond between the hero's. The jokes were funny and it really felt like a family. All the visuals looked amazing. From the spaceships to the planets the CGI was flawless. I loved it. It showed that the creators put their heart and soul into making this movie. Avengers Endgame is an absolute treat. Do watch this movie.",10
"Good movie, but too forced",27 April 2019,"Couldnt help feeling that Endgame is to Infinity Wars what Dark Knight Rises was to Dark Knight.

A good follow up but the bar was already set too high. Very entertaining, with a satisfying ending, but got there after quite a few plot holes and unanswered questions.

It felt like the writers wrote the ending first and then tried really hard to take us to that end, regardless of what plot holes they were forced to leave in the wake.

PS didn't really like what they did to Thor and Hulk. Good for laughs maybe, but the characters deserved better",8

Neither self-contained nor original,26 April 2019,"The film has too many references to previous Marvel films, and is not friendly to those who are not Marvel fans. General audiences may easily get confused: what is this and why is that? The story is not original either. We have seen too many time-travel films, such as Back to the Future and Days of Future Past. This film does not offer anything new. Besides, the last thirty minutes are kind of redundant, and the overall running time is unnecessarily long.",

It was alright. Not revelatory. The best thing that happened in the movie was the heroic sacrifice. That was awesome. They captured the emotion perfectly, it was sad, but appropriate. This had some feel-good moments with massive collaboration from most of the entire universe. Also, this movie could possibly have elevated to an 8 if they put Deadpool in...that would have been awesome and hilarious. It was not overly thought-provoking. It was just a little above the average popcorn Marvel movie-nothing truly profound, just fun verbal quips and too much fighting and too many missions that somehow ends alright (not amazingly though).",6

I also didn't like Pepper suddenly being outfitted as a fighter?! lol! And, considering the future hero roles revealed in this one, can we eventually expect a white Black Panther, too?! Don't get me wrong - I don't want to see a white Black Panther.

Speechless,26 April 2019,"The only word I could muster after the screen cut to black was ""Unbelievable.""

The Marvel Cinematic Universe is an achievement in film like we've never seen before, and Avengers: Endgame is the perfect culmination of this journey we have been on over the last decade. I genuinely cannot comprehend a more perfect way to end this story along with several character arcs.

Endgame takes all of the best things from the previous 21 films and packs them seamlessly into the 3-hour runtime that still somehow leaves you wanting more. All of the main characters give pinnacle performances here (one in particular, which you might have a guess but I will refrain from saying here).

Hours later, I am still mostly speechless. Nothing else I can put into words will be able to do this film justice. You simply have to experience it for yourself.

If you're a lifelong Marvel fan, you will swoon over this film. It will touch your heart. It will go down in history. Now stop what you're doing and go experience Avengers: Endgame.",10

Infinity War was the moment we were all waiting for and then they tell us they are going to split it into two films. End Game could have gone south with this choice, but it did not. It's always exciting, especally if you are a comic book fan or have been watching these movies for now eleven years. Don't want to say too much, but shine a light on Robert Downey Jr. who got to perfect his Iron Man persona to the point where Hugh Jackman can't even surpass him. Captain American is giving all us FanBoys everything we ever wanted to see and Thor...underperforms with hilarious results (and hopefully will create 2019's most popular costume for a certain type of man).

"Plot holes and other blockbuster weaknesses, but it is impressive in how well it lands this huge beast in a way that satisfies and delivers",2 June 2019,"Much like I did for Infinity War, I was caught up a little bit on the hype, but mostly I think I prioritized seeing this so that I could browse Reddit again, since so many popular posts are memes from the final two Avengers films. Unsurprisingly perhaps, I found that it was very much the overall picture I found with Infinity War, which is that it is far from perfect, a blockbuster pure and simple, but that it is quite a piece of work in terms of how well put together it all is.

In terms of that structure, at time of writing this there are quite a few comments comparing it to the final season of Game of Thrones (which right now just has 2 episodes left) in the way that it has to bring everything together. The comparison is unfavorable, partly because GoT continues it very rushed approach to writing, but mainly because Endgame does it very well. The detail of the plotting is of course filled with holes that are best just to ignore, but the structure allows for a very nice conclusion as we retouch on moments from within the existing films, allowing nostalgia, references, and a sense of winding it up (although of course it will continue as long as the films make money). As with Infinity War, the writing somehow gives characters enough time despite there being so many of them; it hits several tones but none undercuts or takes away from another; and it mixes humor and action into a plot that takes itself seriously enough so it feels like it has weight.

Of course it is still a blockbuster film, and far from perfect, but it is impressively done and very easy to enjoy if you go with what it is doing.",

A fitting farewell to an incredible era,24 April 2019,"DISCLAIMER- This is a spoiler FREE review

Well, here we are.

After 11 year's of top quality entertainment and planning that started all the way back with 2008's surprise smash hit Iron Man (do you feel old yet? I sure do), this part of Marvel's world domination comes to an end with what's likely to be one of, if not the biggest film's of all time, The Avengers: Endgame.

It's a somewhat odd, occasionally emotional and fitting experience sitting back and concluding this part of the Marvel universe and while we know there's countless more Marvel film's coming our way, Endgame really does feel like the culmination of year's of hard work and adventures, that while not perfect, feels like a fitting tribute to what's come before and what still lays ahead.

It's incredibly hard to talk about Endgame in depth without ruining the narrative the Russo brother's and their team have created but suffice to say the creative minds behind the scenes have given us another top quality piece of blockbuster filmmaking, that's likely to please diehard fans and more casual cinemagoers alike, the only problem is, when compared to it's genuinely surprising and perfectly paced predecessor, Endgame does feel slightly more formulaic and long in the tooth.

It's picky for sure, but Infinity War gave us a Marvel experience that was unexpected, hilarious, emotional and epic and while Endgame has this in parts, it's not as all encompassing as last year's experience, even if by the rulebook, this was never going to be the case when tying up so many loose ends and finalising so much of what has come before it over the year's.

A lot of these endings and plot tie ups will please those that have invested so much into a series that has been operating on an extremely high level for a number of year's, it's just that Marvel almost outdid themselves in Infinity War, making the more by the numbers plot threads and leaps of logic found in Endgame more highlighted than usual.

The other minor nitpick with the film is Endgames much talked about epic 3 hour runtime and while the film starts with some unexpected and emotionally charged instances, there's a clear late beginning and middle section of the film that at times drags and cover's similar ground one too many times, even if by relative terms, the runtime in the Russo's film never is too detrimental to the fun to be had.

This fun comes in many forms, with particular highlights being Thor's new found lifestyle, the Hulk's more prominent role and Captain Marvel's addition to the Avengers family, while the films big action scenes (that must be said aren't that abundant) are a sight to behold, with Marvel once more showing off their ability to handle spectacles as good as, if not better than, everyone else.

At the end of the day, it's been an incredible period for Marvel, with arguably no outright failures and an abundance of big winners, we've been spoilt for 11 straight year's and while Endgame may not be the best of the best, it's still a mighty fine and emotionally charged finale that does the beloved cinematic universe proud.

Final Say -

While not as surprising or even as Infinty War, Endgame is still a top quality and fitting end to so much good work that's come before it and while it's sad to say goodbye to this particular era, it's exciting to see what lays in store for Marvel moving ahead.

Plot holes galore. Overrated.,30 April 2019,"Believe it or not, I expected this storyline. That Thanos would destroy the stones and Avengers will move on until they find a way to travel back in time. I said I hope it wasn't using Quantum realm because it would be repeatable. And that's exactly what happened.

The movie is plagued by plot holes. I will not go over all of them but I spent over an hour after the movie listing all the plot holes to my daughter. The biggest and the most ridiculous one is that the Avengers had only enough Pym particles for one round trip each. Movie made a big deal about this. But towards the end, Thanos uses one vial of Pym particle on his ship with everyone on board. With thousands of minion creatures on it. With no special ""Quantum"" suit or equipment. You mean to tell me Avengers could've just got on a vehicle and teleport all together with one vial? And with Hank Pym back now, they can time travel at will from now on. Or go back in time to get more just like they did in the movie. This completely ruins the Marvel Universe.

Avengers can travel back in time where they first made the Ironman version of Infinity Gauntlet. Borrow it, defeat any villain with a snap, and return it to exact moment. Avengers of the past will understand since they did same thing when retrieving the stones.

Also now everyone is Antman. Everyone can shrink, go to Quantum realm, and time travel. Nothing special about Antman now. These are just fraction of all the plot holes.

There also was a huge plot hole fail in The Last Jedi when Holdo sliced Snoke's mothership by going lightspeed. Which ruined the Star Wars Universe. And these rivals that plot hole.

Their version of time travel is a big mess too. It says past and future is not connected and changing past doesn't effect future but there are parts where it shows the new past effecting the future. And they were making fun of Back to the Future.",6
Orribile,9 January 2021,"Bella SGI e tutto ma il film è velocissimo, non si capisce un c***o. Nel complesso è carino ma ha una valutazione troppo alta.",1
Could have been better,3 May 2019,Expected more from the Hulk after his no show in Infinity War and then after that mess the writers turn around and make one of the mightiest hero's (Thor) a drunk. Infinity was was far better and it was the perfect set up for End game that the writers screwed up,
Ok hear me out,26 July 2019,"This is getting a 10/10 mostly because how it doesnt flop on its head ending a 22 movie long plot. Is this the best marvel movie? No not even close, is this as good as infinity war? No, me 2 months ago would say it is but me now would say other wise. But simply for the experience of seeing the first iron man in theaters when I was 8 to now me as 19 and making me cry it is easily a 10/10 due to it being like no other experience. If it wasnt an ending to a 22 movie long era than mayhe my score would reflect like an 8 or a 7, but due to it being what it is I am willing to bump it up. It is still better than like 15 marvel movies, it's still up there for one of their stronger movies. It's not as good as infinity war and winter soldier is still my favorite marvel movie not counting spiderman movies.

TLDR: Its simply unlike any experience in film yet, having a movie end a 22 movie long story and not flop on its face, usually movies cant finish a 3 movie long story without flopping, yet this movie managed to do it with a 22 movie long story. It isnt the best marvel movie, far from it, I would argue that infinity war is a much better movie, but I would say that this is my 2nd favorite avengers movie",8
It's fantastic and beautiful,24 April 2019,,10
What a ride!,27 April 2019,"Don't enter the theatre with preconceived notions of what you wanted them do do with this movie, no. Instead let it unfold as Infinity Wars did, an unexpected storm. This movie was epic, the acting, the cinematography, the story, the mixture and combinations of joy, pai, and suspense...all the years of a finally woven Marvel heroic tapestry. Finished. But in a way that leaves me yearning for more, but relishing the memories of the characters I once simply read about as a child from the 60s to seeing them in the big screen like never before. Man this was a great movie! A must see. Hollywood Oscar folks time to stop overlooking these cinematic treasures. There were some Oscar worthy performances in here. Phase was of the age of marvelous Marvel heroes hit it crescendo. And it was one for the ages!",10
LAST HURRAH,24 April 2019,"As an avid MCU Films fan, the Avengers: Endgame was by far THE BEST MCU FILM. For 10 years MCU has always delivered blockbuster movies and Endgame felt like their BIG BANG or LAST HURRAH; a trophy for all the 20 MCU films we have seen and loved.

Sitting through a 3-hour film never felt this quick but it was not short of satisfaction. It gave me all the feels, from laughs, to tears, to being in awe, to surprises.

However, I wouldn't recommend watching this without watching all the MCU Films before this.

Avengers: Endgame is WORTH THE HYPE. This is the finale that will stay with us.",10
Have you ever felt like you're watching history?,27 April 2019,"This was truly the first time that as I was watching, I felt like I immediately recognized a movie's future significance. The duology of Infinity War and Endgame, I believe, will be remembered as the pinnacle of superhero movies. That's all there is to it.",10
Best superhero film ever made,27 April 2019,"It's going to be very difficult to top this, and it's also very difficult to express how amazing this film is without spoilers, so I will just keep it brief and say that you are doing yourself a disservice if you don't see this film. It is an epic event in every sense of the word, and you will never forget seeing this movie. The last hout will never leave your memory as long as you live. It is the epitome of action sacrifice and heroism and encapsulates the never ending battle of good versus evil. Go see this movie. See it twice.",10
Guys come on!,8 May 2019,"Really, people think this is like 8.9?

This means i am really getting old. I love Infitinty war and i went to the theater like super-hyped. During the movie i wanted to like everything, then when it was over I thought, man it was bad. I am sad, how is this possible?

I am ok that this is being bad. But why people think it is ~8-9? it is a good 6 max 7, but noooo...",6
Dont even try- NOTHING will prepare you,24 April 2019,"I laughed, I cried, I exclaimed, I cried, I laughed, I cried and then I kept crying.

Rest assured, the writers do these characters every justice they deserve, by closing long running arcs beautifully, albeit, sadly. It is a painful goodbye to the Infinity Arc but they've done it superbly. The endgame of over 22 films, a saga spanning 11 years has culminated into something so powerful, so awe inspiring on the screen, I urge every one to watch it to feel firsthand, the beauty, the pain and triumph of our heroes.

The movie picks up right where the previous left off. It allows the viewer some time to cope with the devastation wrecked by Thanos in the previous film. It is remarkable and therefore worth noting that every trailer issued for this movie comes in the first 20 mins of the movie and hence everything afterwards is such a whirlwind. The movie gives nod to some of our favourite moments in the past films and still continues to give.

You will have many naysayers. Dont listen to them. The movie is powerful. The effects, the music, the story, the emotions. Its honestly a hell of a ride.

Stan Lee is up there somewhere, smiling. And we too will learn to smile through our tears.",10
Good Movie But Not Infinity War Kinda Good ....,8 May 2019,"Tamed Hulk, traumatized Ironman, fantasy of yesterday - Cap America. what did I do with my hair - Cpt Marvel . Dr Stranger things and many more with fault of not their own were part of the final movie in one of the most successful and entertaining spectacles of the past decade.

The movie itself was a huge collection of familiar faces and scenes, from all major events in MCU, lacking cohesive structure which distorted flow of the movie. The spectacle was too long and action sequences were unevenly spaced which created over too long moments that were more about homage to the last decade of superhero bonanza and tremendous logistic achievement. After all getting all of the cameo actors from the last movies and inserting them into this plot must have been very difficult. Did they suceed ? No, they did not. The effort was admirable and gave us some really touching moments but resulted in unnecessary extending already too long movie. This was confusing the main story plot too much. There were just too much of it. Movie did not offer viewer any spectacular skirmishes in a first two hours. Thats what made IW so special. Endgage was lacking these impactful moments. It is clear that the best was saved for last but this only validates that movie did not have to be so long. If a movie would be filled with IW level of awesome than yeah, bring it on but the problem is that it was stretched too thin and these moments are just not there, not in the beginning anyway.

PG-12 rating is a culprit here. If movie's rating was higher I am sure that scenes filled with nothing would be at least more electryfying but because this is a movie aimed at future and former fans, the lighter representation of after apocalypse universe was the only thing Disney corporate machine could have come up with and still get away with achieving PG-12 rating. Younger audience and older audience looked bored in the cinema though. The balance was not achieved here.

The final stand off was amazing though and I will say that it is worth the price of admission. When I will be rematching Endgame on blue ray I think I will just skip to the last few chapters just to experience all this wonderfully done explosions and amazingly done fights. It was just epic and the team definitely raised the bar here.

Overall the movie was ok but it did not top IW for me. This one will still be the best Avenger movie.",7

Back to the Avenger's 11 Infinity.Stone heist,25 April 2019,,
An Incredible Finale to a Memorable Saga,26 April 2019,"I went in to Avengers: Endgame with high expectations and they were still shattered.

First off, nobody is ready for the 3 hours that conclude the Infinity Saga and if you think you are then you're wrong. This is easily the best MCU movie so far and one of the best superhero movies of all time. The visuals are stunning and the cast and crew goes all out to give us the cinematic event of a lifetime.

The movie features a strong and engaging plot with directors Anthony and Joe Russo clearly showing us that they know what they're doing. Character arcs across the board come to a satisfying conclusion and just remind us why we, as fans, have invested this much in these films the past 11 years.

Bring your tissues, because this is without a doubt the most emotional adventure that Marvel has put us on as an audience. Emotional scenes are backed up by Alan Silvestri's stunningly beautiful and goosebump-inducing soundtrack, with many callbacks to previous MCU movies that prove that this is a worthy conclusion.

Incredibly astounding and emotionally affecting end to a saga that started with a billionaire in a cave with a box of scraps and a scrawny kid from Brooklyn who just wanted to do the right thing.

Go see this film; you will not regret it at all.",10
Don't get duped by the trailer!,24 April 2019,"Warning: This movie will exceed your expectation!!!

Marvel has quite mastered the art of story-telling!

The trailer has been teasing us with pretty much nothing and what a way to promote Endgame.

In the rarity of today's world, where most trailers almost tell you everything in 3 minutes.

This review is about to reveal nothing just like the trailer did other than what an epic conclusion!!

The end of an Era. Onto the next one.,4 September 2021,"This movie isn't perfect. But i feel like Endgame is actually pretty amazing because it has more characters than any other movie and somehow manages to give a conclusive ending to all of them along with 11 years of the Infinity saga. Ngl, My life was complete when I saw the Portals scene.",9
A great conclusion,26 April 2019,"Avengers: Endgame is not a perfect movie, but it feels like one. Every character get an end to their arcs, and the film itself is a great conclusion to 11 years of movies, all of which have led up to this. I wont spoil the actual plot for those who haven't seen it (the trailers have been incredible at not revealing anaything), but I will say that it is full of surprises, shocks, laughs and tears. The fact that the film manages to be THIS good more than makes up for its few flaws. The final battle is probably the most fan-pleasing, epic and emotionaly packed action sequence in any superhero movie; it was the culmiation if 11 years of characters we've come to love and care about. This is what superhero movies are all about.",9

Is it worth it?,26 April 2019,"After 21 films worth of waiting, Marvel has finally reached the conclusion to the Infinity Saga in Avengers: Endgame. The collective movies had mad billions of dollars, and captured the hearts of comic book fans around the world. The prior entry, Avengers: Infinity War added a certain sense of gravitas and catharsis to the Marvel Universe. The prior film left fans not only devastated, but with more questions than answers with it's cliffhanger, serial ending. So how does the conclusion fare? Are the Fallen avenged? Is Endgame worth the hype?

One of my greatest praises of Shazam! was the amount of personal consequence it had. One of my biggest criticisms of most superhero movies is that the consequence is constantly about saving the world. This then makes saving the world a redundant outcome that we know the superheroes will eventually solve. With constant resurrections and story revisions, the Marvel Universe greatly lacked this. Yet even though the world saving was still the primary conflict of Endgame, the story contained personal consequence for each individual character that made the film far more endearing to the viewer. This filled the film with incredibly written, visceral moments of joy, pain, and everything in between.

The amount of story-boarding that went into the film is insane. The run time is long, but a necessary evil to the human bladder to tie up so many loose ends within an incredibly convoluted plot. The Marvel Cinematic Universe has so many characters, and Endgame gives resolution to their individual strife, while raising questions that can be pursued in future films. It gives each character their own space in the spotlight while concurrently sharing it equally. It is absolute brilliant direction by the Russo brothers.

I cannot justifiably call Endgame the singular greatest superhero film of all time. Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy is still brilliant, and did not need 21 films of buildup. Yet it absolutely rivals the trilogy with the first Marvel film that takes a chance with the ultimate pathos. The film rewards the fans who have seen all of the films, even the poorer entries, while inviting new fans with instant accessibility. I never checked my watch, I never felt the need to get up from my seat, which is something that has never occurred for me within a three hour movie. Not every direction choice worked as intended, not every story point was logistically flawless, but it still works. I laughed, I cried, and sometimes even did bof. Not both, but BOF. I can't give Avengers:Endgame any grade worse than perfect.

(Grade: 10/10)",10

This film is enjoyed the most when the audience is knowledgeable of the marvel cinematic universe and it enhances the emotions of the audience due to the bond forged through the commitment of watching all 21 films before Endgame. If someone were to ask me: ""Is it one of the best films you have ever seen?""

This movie concluded the past 11 years in the best possible way or even better because a movie like this seemed to be impossible. The great battle scene is the very best in cinematic history, to be honest it is almost as good as an orgasm. I am happy that I could witness it - what is more on the premiere day. This masterpiece made me prouder than ever to be an MCU fan! Well done! Pretty sure I will pay to see it again... and again... :)",10
A Satisfying Conclusion,27 April 2019,"Avengers Endgame Review Score - 10/10 Avengers Endgame could be well described as the most complicated storyline in the entire Marvel history not only because it had to wrap up a story of eleven years but also because of the complex solution to an inevitable situation that The Avengers try to achieve with the avenging not being the major part of the story. The three hour runtime was well utilized by giving more time to establish the characters' humanistic attachments and the losses they suffered; not only in this movie, but from the very moment they've been incepted into this franchise. Unlike the previous outings, the characters differ in their choices and these contrasts in their choices lead up to one massive and satisfying final battle which may not end the entire MCU, but certainly does end a glorious era of the long franchise. The entire movie, especially the final battle was a huge fan service as it included everything a Marvel fan could possibly dream of. PS: There is no Post - Credits Scene in the film, but it is worth waiting for the entire credits to roll.",9
Lower your expectations,30 April 2019,"I'll keep this short and spoiler free.

Simply, it doesn't compare in story, performances, characters, structure, or even excitement to Infinity War. Infinity War far surpassed expectations on all fronts where unfortunately Endgame comes short.

It's a fun movie and there's great and powerful moments. But ultimately there wasn't nearly enough suspense, and the plot was far too messy and borderline lazy.

It was a good movie but I'm sad to say a disappointment in regards to what came before and in regards to the place it holds now in the history of the MCU.

If you're just looking for a fun movie and are willing to ignore major plot holes, lazy story elements, and lacklustre character choices hopefully you can enjoy it for what it is. But it's no Infinity War; and although it has redeeming elements (which on their own could've been part of a great film) it's overall a disappointment. Lower your expectations. I hope you like it better than I did.",6
A roller-coaster,27 April 2019,"To witness the end of this legendary franchise is bittersweet. This movie makes one cry, laugh, smile, think, cheer, worry, and imagine. It is perfection.

Meh,27 April 2019,"If you're a fan of the MCU, this movie most likely maxes out at about an 8/10. If you're a fan of superhero movies, this movie is not for you. Slow drama scenes fill the better part of a very long run time, leading to a 3 hour long superhero movie with only a handful of fight scenes and minimal action.

Rather predictable for the most part. Very hit-or-miss: either a dream come true or quite mediocre. For the ""movie of the century"", it sure was a let down, that's for sure.",
Movie History,24 April 2019,"It has been, a little under eleven years since I saw the first iron man movie with my dad in the movie theater, at the time none of us really could imagine what was in store for us. the infinity saga is one of the most complex stories I have ever seen strung together within the cinematic universe. Endgame has everything I could have asked for, humor, plot twists, world-class acting, life lessons, heartbreak, and most importantly closure, and although not all of them are great, I am certain that I one day will make my kids watch the entire saga in the hopes that they will find them as special as we did.

I've never laughed and cried and were at the edge of my seat all at the same time, in a single movie. I thought it was gonna be just a re-do, a battle and then bye-bye Avengers era. But, no. It was so much more. It was an epic way to mark a 10 year old journey. Russo brothers, you blew me away. You better get an oscar for that screen writing. Oh, and RDJ you are a brilliant actor.

It was house full with too much clapping n whistling n some of the dialogues went bouncer. Will watch it again but I feel it is not on par with Infinity War. In Infinity War, the war sequence n the fight scenes were all shot in broad daylight n that too in an open field of Wakanda without the fast paced camera tricks. It was visible who was fighting who but Endgame's war sequence is shot in the dark with too much fast paced camera tricks. At times it became hectic to make out who is fighting who. The entry of Thor during the war in Infinity was epic but in Endgame it was duds. The entry of Captain America with the background sound to save Vision in Infinity War was again epic but in Endgame it is not at all exciting. Rocket's one liners were good though.",7
Don't know what the fuss was about,18 May 2019,"A disjointed CGI mess. Too much going on to feel like a real narrative was going on. Very few laughs, didn't feel like it had much of a soul. Thought infinity war was a much more complete marvel movie.",3
Unsatisfied,1 May 2019,I live Marvel .I love Superheroes.I love MCU and I loved Infinity War.The way I left the hall after I watched Infinity and The way I left the hall AFTER watching Endgane was completely different.So much hype and well deserved too but the ending was just not satisfactory at all.I liked bits of it but the other bit I just forced myself to like it just because I've been a fan of the creators and the actors and the characters for so long.But no It was not what I wanted not what we deserved.,

A succes to remember for a lifetime!,24 April 2019,"Every single marvel movie serves as a stepping stone to this very movie. This movie is complete on every aspect from the beginning to the end. Every Avenger plays a significant role that tells their story to the full. Filled with action, emotion, comedy and a great storyline, this movie will blow everyone away in 2019 and beyond.

Tour de force,30 November 2019,"Everybody, I mean everybody was in this movie. Endgame is basically an epic superhero movie. It will be interesting to see if they can ever top this on this kind of scale.

I regret not seeing Avengers in the theater. This is the type of movie that needs to be watched on the big screen. I avoided it because I thought it was hype and only for the most diehard fans. However I think moviegoers who aren't really into this genre can appreciate Endgame.

It's got a lot of fun action. The action scenes were good the movie has some events which kept it from becoming predictable. There were many stories which kept it exciting. I liked the bond between the hero's. The jokes were funny and it really felt like a family.

The visuals looked amazing. From the spaceships to the planets the CGI was flawless. I loved it. It showed that the creators put their heart and soul into making this movie. Avengers Endgame is an absolute treat.",10

I am not sure if there will be a better movie than this in the upcoming years. But this has got to be the best superhero comic movie ever made! If you are hyped with all this reviews coming in, you have another thing coming your way. Stop whatever you are doing and do whatever it takes to the watch this epic movie of the year! A finale well written and a movie worth every penny of your money. Bring your kids, family, friends and have the best 3 hours of your life like i did. We were never ready for this. We never did.... #WhateverItTakes #Endgame",10
Keeping it simple - it was average,14 May 2019,"Not going to go into any spoilers I just felt that overall the movie was average, it did a lot of things right and a lot of things wrong. The acting was decent, the action scenes were good if few and short and the pacing wasn't atrocious.

But there were flaws, Brie Larson could have been replaced by a cardboard cut out, some of the twists made little sense and the big fight was rather unsatisfying and had a really cringy scene (you'll know it when you see it)

Ultimately it's worth watching but the people rating this a 10 are overly hyped or wearing blinders because there were more than enough flaws evident throughout the movie. Basically go in expecting an alright action flick and you'll enjoy it.",7
Made for the Fans,5 May 2019,"Nothing really happening ....Captain Marvel is in it for a bit...Black Panther was in it too, not sure why

Avengers: Endgame sticks the landing,24 April 2019,"Go ahead and watch the trailers for Avengers: Endgame, they won't give anything major away. It's amazing for a huge movie to be so self-aware of itself, as well as, the movie genres that they're overtly borrowing from. The minor characters or those not even in Avengers: Infinity War, step up and help set up huge sequences that are highly entertaining and actually answer questions. Avengers: Endgame acknowledges every aspect of the characters emotions in their previous MCU film's and succeeds in the most Meta way possible.

Ant-Man is a major reason for this. It's no spoiler to say that he's in the film as he produces some of the biggest laughs from the trailer of him ringing the bell at the Avenger's front gate. It's Paul Rudd's wry jokes, quick timing and fish out of water facial expressions that really assist things.

The pacing of Avengers: Endgame is amazing and not for the reasons you might think. It's brilliantly paced, but it throws the entire formula and how MCU films are done on their head. Battle, loss, battle, loss, humor and then victory, take those ingredients, shake well and you've got a loose description of some average superhero films.

If Avengers: Infinity War left you feeling betrayed and bummed out, I feel you. Avengers: Endgame more than makes up for any ill feelings that it caused. I see why they played it the way they did, and doing so any other way would've cheapened the film, watered down the MCU and made it all disposable. It is also worth noting that the film balance lots of humor with the drama, all the while putting it in a nice bow with stones.

What we're left with is a 10 year opus that spans more arcs than Lord of the Rings and encapsulates it all in a perfect manner. Granted, they will still make many MCU films, this is not their swan song. However, there is a victory lap feeling about Avengers: Endgame. It respects the fans, adds to the dramatic elements, answers questions that fans have wondered about and plants a couple new seeds to grow on.

Is Avengers: Endgame OK for children? If your child has seen any MCU film then they'll be OK with this. The film has fair number of bad words, but the violence is on par with what younger fans are accustomed to. For example, there isn't any one instance that's as graphic as when the monster ate the businessman in Shazam!, but there are sustained action sequences that might test those 8 years old who haven't seen an MCU movie before.",9
Monumental. Breathtaking. The end of an era.,24 April 2019,"I'm among those people, who normally don't engage in writing reviews. But this time I really have and want to. I rewatched the infinity-saga prior to Engame's release and there couldn't have been a better ending to it then the one it got. It really has been an epic ride and I feel privileged to have been able to be a part of it. Though only being a spectator, I feel connected to these characters, they are like long know friends. Endgame is the epic and monumental end to the saga which began over a decade ago. And oh it is more then worthy to be the last milestone on this incredible journey. I went through so many emotions watching this, joy, pride, happiness, sorrow and a sense of being alive and what it means to be human. Just watch it, you'll see what I mean, I really don't promise too much. It's truely hard to say goodbye to so many beloved characters, but they get the ending they deserve and will always be the franchise's core. Thank you for this amazing journey Marvel.",10

A MARVELOUS END GAME,24 April 2019,"After 11 years and 22 movies, Marvel Studios brought us the most ambitious movie, the greatest culmination, it is nostalgic, sentimental and completely unexpected. All the characters are so well-balanced, to each one is given plenty of screen time to development. If you're a marvel fan you'll feel like you're finally complete, you've never seen anything like this before, there are many references to all the 22 movies and there is a certain inevitability about the plot, there are plenty surprises. The movie present us an incredible balancing between nostalgia and novelty, you will scream, laugh and cry, it is the Marvel recipe elevated to the highest level. There's just so much in it, that I can't even write about it without spoiling everything. This is not the end for Marvel, but it certainly marks an ending for several of the characters we've watched and loved over the last decade, there will be more superhero franchises but it's hard to imagine any one being so culturally resonant. It is the grande finale.",8

Marvel sticks the landing with its Endgame,24 April 2019,"This is a historic movie. The story that Marvel and Disney crafted for over a decade comes to its conclusion in an epic 3-hour film that is for the ages.

All the characters, some of which we've known and loved for years and others we just met, get their share of love and their time to shine, with cheers and applause ensuing several times. There were tears aplenty, but also quite a few laugh, in particular from a character you don't usually think of as comic relief. The movie takes time to show us the unbearable loss of Infinity War and how the Avengers each deal with it, before a way to bring back all of the victims of the Snap appears. But don't think you know how this is going to go because whenever you think THAT was the big twist, there's probably another one coming.

New abilities are revealed, emotional arcs are fulfilled and heroes change as Marvel lays the ground work for its next phase that will officially start after the release of Spider-Man: Far from Home this summer. Endgame ends with an open door to the MCU's future, but for the first time since its beginning, the movie does not feature a post-credit scene, leaving us wondering what's to come.

I feel like this is the kind of movie I'll be happy to say I saw in the theater the day it came out 30 years from now when they remake it for the third time. This is a once in a generation cultural phenomenon and I hope you go see it in the theatre because you will not regret it.",10
"Good, but slightly underwhelming",8 May 2019,"Don't get me wrong, the movie was great. There were some very epic moments and some very sad moments. However, it was way too long. Without getting into spoilers, I found myself pretty bored within the first hour.

80% of EndGame was really just a fan service/tribute to the MCU fans who watched all the previous MCU titles (most of which I saw). Even after the ~30 mins climatic battle (which was the best part of the film), however, the movie somehow continues to drag itself on again.

I also felt there were some plot holes in the story/concepts; I had trouble understanding how it all worked.

The humor was alright, but it is of typical MCU-grade comedy. Again, some jokes were good, while other jokes were just dragged on or plain cheesy.

Overall I liked Infinity War better",7
Unwatchable movie,13 February 2021,"This movie is awful. Shot very badly, the editing gives you a headache and doesn't show any movement of the camera.

Just one word. Perfect!,26 April 2019,"Before reading this, I just request you to take two minutes and think of best possible conclusion to this 22 movies saga. Thought of one? Now multiply the awesomeness of your ending by a 100 times and still this movie will surprise your assumptions! If a critic like me who just can't stop finding errors in a movie failed in finding big mistakes in this movie, I think you should believe this one is just perfect! Sure there were a few tweaks, but I am ready to ignore them seeing how smoothly the whole 3 hours of the runtime just passed by. I was literally sticked to my seat for 3 hours, even during the interval, I was like I want to see the whole movie in one length. Tell you the truth, I was not much impressed with Infinity wars or Ragnarok (not even mentioning captain marvel here xD), but Russo brothers just nailed this one. After waiting for 21 movies, we deserved a perfect end, and we got one. 10/10 from my side. If 21 movies lead to this, I am ready to watch another set of 21 for such a perfection!",10

It had moments where people cried, clapped and gasped. Go see it!",9
Epic,24 April 2019,"Film full of emotions, happiness, fun, anger and sadness, there is a bit of everything",10
"Not an MCU fan, but really enjoyed this",29 April 2019,"No spoilers!!

Being a sceptic of Marvel movies for a long time, I had low expectations going into Endgame. I didn't love Infinity War, but I wanted to see this film opening weekend to avoid spoilers and see how the 10-year culmination of the MCU concluded. Well, I was pleasantly surprised with the film. It's not without its issues, but Endgame felt like one of the most unique and captivating Marvel films to date. I was very surprised at how easily I was engaged throughout the 3-hour runtime. The film breaks down into three parts, each part having its pros and cons. Personally, I thought the first act was the weakest and overstayed its welcome. Despite that, there were still some interesting parts that helped flesh out the aftermath of Infinity War. The second and third act felt very original and had many surprising moments that kept me guessing what would happen next. However, there were parts that felt VERY fan servicey. Of course, some of the fan service was fine, but at other points it felt like a little much.

One of the great things about this movie was that it broke from the simple MCU formula. It has a much different story than any of the other MCU films and utilizes much different plot mechanisms to make it feel more original. The emotional range of the film was another thing that felt different to me compared to many other MCU films. I thought the humor in this film was handled much better, causing me to laugh multiple times. Not only was the film funny at points, but it also had some sad, depressing, exciting, and thrilling sequences. This film, unlike some other MCU films, was able to have some very serious moments and did not have to cut the emotional tension by inserting a cheesy one-liner.

Despite it being a much more original and emotionally driven film compared to other MCU films, it did have some shortcomings. I think that some of the fan service took me out of the film because it felt either overdramatic or forced. There were times were I caught myself rolling my eyes at how overdramatic or socially 'woke' the movie was being. One scene in particular felt like a blatant advertisement in the middle of the film, which was jarring and cringe worthy. There were also many moments of the film that could have been explained to help bring more tension, but instead were brushed over in order to fit everything into a reasonably lengthed film. I think there were parts that should have been cut or shorted and other parts that should have been extended. Lastly, I thought that Thanos was misused in this film. I was excited to see his role in this film but was left disappointed by his role as the villain.

As someone who wouldn't consider themselves a Marvel fan, I had fun watching this movie regardless of it having some issues. I would definitely recommend it if you have been following the MCU at all recently, but I probably don't need to do that because everyone and there mother is going to see this. Overall, I thought it was enjoyable and quite possibly my favorite Marvel film.

P.S. It feels satisfying to have this chapter of superhero movies come to a close. I hope that it will make way for more innovative and interesting films, whether they are superhero related or not.",7

Tap the breaks: Slow down the hype train!,1 May 2019,"Spoiler Free!

Was endgame good? Yes Was endgame fun? Per usual Was endgame non stop action? Kind of Was endgame $400 million to make? Yes

If I gave you $400 million to make a movie it wouldn't be to difficult to pay top actors, writers and fund state of the art animations.

Endgame is a relatively non-stop rollercoaster of Marvel nostalgia. Great end to a storied franchise? Kind of. This is nowhere near the cinematic greatness of LOTR: Return of the King. That was a true film through and through. Endgame is monster budget with 80% boring monologue and corny jokes. If that's what you enjoy then all power to you.

Endgame has less action than any other Avengers film which I found incredibly disappointing and a let down.

Would I recommend you to see endgame? Don't be silly, this is generational movie. Generational in the sense of big money, big actors, mega marketing and big answers to a beloved storyline of multiple hero's. Marvel movies are popular because we have been told by everyone we have to love them. If you have one bad thing to say about a Marvel movie, you will become more isolated than Tom Hanks in Castaway. Well worth a watch but please...pump the brakes.",8
High Expectations....,27 April 2019,"Overall this was a good movie. Character screen time was definitely not split as well as the last outing. Just seemed like a long build up for a poorly lit end battle. Again, a good show but not up to the standard that I have grown to expect for Marvel.",7
A REWARDING EXPERIENCE!!!!,24 April 2019,"I have never given a 10/10 to a superhero film since the first Avengers film wayyy back in 2012. This movie is not perfect obviously (1. Some jokes fell flat and some of it i felt just appeared at the wrong time 2. Some songs i felt were placed or played at the wrong time too 3. Some people might have a problem with the pacing of the first act but i personally loved the slow pace), but this movie doesnt need to be perfect and there are obviously better superhero films in terms of quality like Captain America: Civil War, Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Logan, The Dark Knight and so on but come on man. Those movies are great movies but Avengers: Endgame is magic/one-of-a-lifetime-event!

Never have i once laughed, cried, cheered and screamed this much in a movie. I have also never thought i could get this much of a rewarding experience from rewatching all 21 MCU films. WOW! Thank you Marvel Studios for this experience!

See it without any spoilers, i beg you!",10
A decent end of an era.,9 May 2019,"Infinity war was overall a better movie, but this movie had the disadvantage of being the follow up to that movie. A good chunk of this movie is essentially remembering what happened during infinity war. The struggle against Thanos in this movie... It just isnt done in a satisfying way.

Before Infinity war came out last year, it was already confirmed there would be another Avengers follow up this year. It was speculated that Endgame was actually going to be called ""Infinity war part 2"". Unfortunately, this is Endgame, but it SHOULD have been Infinity war part 2. I know that is very vague, Im trying to be vague, but essentially because of what happened in Infinity War, it was pretty much impossible to make a sequel which feels like it even is the same story with the same consistency & epic feel. Or at least, that is not what we got.

Captain Marvel kinda sucks in this movie. She is a boring character with magic powers. Ughhh great. In hindsight, the tease in Infinity war was cool, but it makes it into a big letdown. And this is kind of the story of the whole movie, if Infinity War was the teaser. (Although it isnt quite that bad, this movie is still pretty good, unlike Captain Marvel in it.)",7
Top long for what it is..,10 August 2019,"Very boring.. Not gonna see again, Will however see the first two installments, as they are way better.",4
Endgame,15 February 2020,"There isn't too much in the way of suspense or surprises when it comes to the story, but there are some shocking moments and funny lines in this epic finale. Again, like many of the best Marvel films, the holes and flaws are covered up with humor and fan service, making everything okay. That being said, I did prefer Infinity War to this film, which really misses the leads of the other Marvel franchises that were ""snapped"" out. Overall, however, there are only a few ways you can wrap up the main story of the MCU, and this was a solid direction.",

I even think that age of ultron was better. All they focused on was linking all the 22 movies into one and fan service. I feel for that reason it wasn't as impactful as infinity war. The way they end the characters stories was ok, i would have done it differently and done something that would make your heart drop, like they did in the first 5 min of the movie. And also they did something to a certain character and all i can say is WHY, SO STUPID. 7 may seem like a descent rating but i am very disappointed because this movie had unlimited potential and now i'll never get to see the endgame i wanted to.",8

"Avengers: Endgame is some of the most thrilling, powerful, beautiful, and emotional entertainment ever put on the big screen.",28 October 2019,"When I walked into the theater for my first viewing of Endgame, I was prepared to see a great superhero movie. I expected some massive fight scenes, a few emotional gut punches, and to walk away with a generic positive message about overcoming obstacles. But I could have never guessed that night that I would cry like a baby, go completely numb from pure awe, and leave the theater with a fresh take on what it really means to be human. It was a night I'll likely remember for the rest of my life.

It all started back in 2008 with the first Iron Man, which was soon followed by several other movies based on popular superheroes from Marvel comics. These superheroes became known as Avengers, appearing together in several blockbuster hits to fight world-threatening enemies. Endgame is the culmination of 22 movies across 11 years, and the anticipation and pressure from the fans were higher than ever before. But somehow, Marvel managed to produce an overwhelmingly satisfying conclusion that met or exceeded all expectations.

The premise of Endgame's storyline is fairly simple: defeat the mad titan Thanos after he wiped out half the universe's population and bring back everyone he killed. However, it ends up quite complex, dealing with quantum physics and time travel. The directors, Joe and Anthony Russo, do an admirable job of making the storyline easy to follow, bouncing between dozens of different settings and timelines without feeling too cluttered. There are also a surprisingly low number of plot holes considering that the movie deals with time travel.

When it comes to pacing, the film has some minor issues. It sometimes feels unnecessarily drawn out during some of the middle sections, where the movie takes a less serious tone and the stakes don't feel quite as high. But it more than makes up for it with an action packed beginning and ending filled with shocking surprises and adrenaline rushes to keep the audience on the edge of their seats.

One of the movie's most impressive feats is how it is able to include so many characters without making a single one feel left out. The main characters of this movie are the original six Avengers, which include Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Black Widow, Hawkeye, and the Hulk. Apart from the Hulk, who unfortunately does not get much of a spotlight, all of their characters develop beautifully throughout the movie and have several major moments to shine. Iron Man in particular ends up almost the complete opposite of his selfish, egotistical, and ignorant past self. Even Thanos, despite being the main antagonist, has a very interesting arc that affects his grand motives as he learns more about humanity's flaws.

As we have come to expect from marvel, the production quality is as good as it gets. The acting performances from all the cast members are easily some of the best they have ever done. Whether through dialogue or simply just facial expressions, the actors and actresses do an amazing job conveying their characters' emotions. The visuals are stunning, with a vibrant color palate and awe inspiring cinematography. The movie relies heavily on cgi, but it is done so well that everything looked completely photorealistic. Accompanying that was a stellar soundtrack by Alan Silvestri that masterfully matches the tone of each scene, elevating them to new heights. ""Portals"" in particular is one of the best soundtracks I have ever heard, and it still gives me major chills every time I listen to it.

The movie particularly excels at creating a very atmospheric feel to many of its scenes, using it's soundtrack and visuals to immerse the viewer into its vast world. Some of the best examples of this are in an early scene with Iron Man in a spaceship, which wonderfully captures the melancholic but peaceful tone of the scene. And perhaps the most prominent example is in the iconic ""Portals"" scene, which emanates sheer awe with its beauty and scope, starting slowly and naturally building up to an earth-shattering climax.

A common criticism with superhero movies in general is that they are mindless ""popcorn entertainment"" only good for action and surprises. However, with Endgame, this could not be further from the truth. Through the Avengers' personal struggles and Thanos's quest to make a perfect universe, the film goes the extra mile in showing how the world and its people are far from perfect, but our lives can still be beautiful. This idea is especially shown within the deeply moving final few scenes.

Avengers: Endgame is a wonderfully thrilling experience for its audience. But it goes a step further and shows us why cinema and storytelling are so important. As Endgame illustrates, emotions are defining characteristics of humanity, and whether good or bad, they shape our lives and allow us to grow. What better way to experience these emotions than through some amazing stories?",9
The Infinity Saga ends with a bang,22 November 2022,"The Russo brothers took what was seemingly a impossible task of not only meeting expectations but of wrapping up a storyline 11 years in the making and they knocked it out of the park.

To take all these characters, their storylines, their archs, and bring it all together to fit in one single film and for everyone to have their moments is what I can only imagine to be an extremely difficult task yet the cast and crew made it look easy. While I would've wished for more screen time from certain characters ie Ronan it was still well done.

Now there's obviously no such thing as the perfect film but this comes damn close. An amazing cast, fantastic visuals, phenomenal score by Alan Silvestri, and something Marvel lacks today good writing.

This was the film of a generation and the theater going experience of a lifetime, I would just like to say thank you to the Russo brothers and the entirety of the cast and crew for the hard work and passion that went into the making of this phenomenal film... I love you 3000!

The film is jam-packed with re-enactments of previous films' relationships. It practically requires that viewers do their homework by watching (or rewatching) a dozen previous films. The emphasis switches from lavish, effects-driven demonstrations of universe-saving heroism to the more personal cost of heroism. It establishes that whoever possesses the six all-powerful Infinity Stones may accomplish almost anything by just snapping their fingers. Because there is so much territory to cover in the film, it skips over introductions and presents Captain Marvel's entrance as a foregone conclusion.",8
Honest Review,28 April 2019,"Pros: top notch cinematic, over the top action, nice concept of time travel.

Cons: chaotic scenes with so many characters, forced cringe moments.",8
"Decent, but doesn't deal with issues",7 May 2019,,7
Where do I start?????,19 October 2019,"This movie is honestly the Empire Strikes Back of Marvel. A lot of movies aren't nearly as good. Firstly, the CGI, the action, and just the special effects on the heroes, they're top notch. Second, I know that this movie doesn't exactly have the action throughout because of the time travel plot, well there's a quite a bit of action scenes, but it gives us a enjoyable throwback to the old MCU movies and saves the big blockbuster action for the finale and there's nothing to be said of the finale except for one word: EPIC. Lastly, it really put a good use of the 11 year buildup of our heroes. And you really careabout all of them. And everyone does career-best performances. But the star of the show is RDJ. He's always been great as Tony Stark, but I don't think he was as good as he was in this movie. He honestly deserves an Oscar. And don't listen to haters of this movie please. Just watch it and enjoy it.",10

I think it would be rude to ask for a more better version of this story..To be honest There is no satisfying ending.. it's always what was best possible way.. Avengers End game makes you realise that your superhero whom you always considered Mentality of steel and Heart full of Power...They are also Human They deserved the life they wanted...And this movie is perfect capturing of what they could do with so less time left on their side...This movie is brilliant, unparalleled dedication..I am happy as well as sad to see this End of an era...But Eventually everything comes to end..So is the movie...

Electrified and emoted,28 April 2019,From the beginning to end the characters are very alive and at the beginning we never going to believe that is gonna happened but it does and after that the movie been a roller coaster and the climax is the generator of goosebumps and at end for me its a pain to dilute the truth. Over all its an perfect ending to the greatest franchise in marvel universe.,9

I didnt know what to expect from this final film, but I certainly wasnt expecting to watch arguably the slowest moving Marvel movie ever made.

MASTERPIECE,25 April 2019,"AND THE WAIT IS OVER

Infinity War which gave the world rumbling because of the wrath of Thanos. And here it elevates the emotions of every MCU fans that too right from the stone.

I always wanted to brag/say about Endgame but that will end up with too many spoilers. So the plot remains unrevealed.

The movie has an ensemble cast feat. all the ones you've known and with the outnumbered super heroes teams up to defeat Thanos, one of the most powerful villain of MCU. He stands out tall in this one too. All superheroes has their own spaces, imprinting themselves in everyone's mind. Endgame portrays the emotions and personal stories of the superheroes and was really touching.

Even though Endgame is Visual Masterpiece but rides through the emotions whole throughout but also will make you laugh. Thor, Antman, Hulk and Rocket leads the laughter squad. Captain America was not my fav. hero, but after this he has a special spot in my heart. Iron Man, he was brilliant. All the superheroes will grab a special place in your heart for sure.

Russo brothers did a wonderful job in terms of writing and in directing. Endgame is visual treat to the eyes and the finale battle was also well convincing. Technical aspects were outstanding in terms of Camera, Score, CGI, Editing, Art, etc.

It's a long 181 minutes movie but you will not take your eyes even for one second.

A must watch in Theaters especially in IMAX. a MASTERPIECE

I will go out with 10 on 10",10

Avengers: Endgame,21 May 2020,"A woman, who has lived and died in the flesh and blood of mortals, has never had a real family, never really been with someone she likes, and finally gave her life for the world. She died so far away, and there was not even a decent funeral after her death. Her friends almost didn't mention her after a short period of grief like no one else In the end, when someone is remembered all over the world, she almost seems to have never existed. Can it be worse?",8
One of the best movies ever made,4 January 2020,Avengers endgame is like a 3 hours roller coaster ride which will make you laugh and make you cry. At some moments you will be speechless and at some moments you will not be able to stop yourself shouting. And at the end you will be happy to be the part of this 3 hours journey.,10
Not up to the hype!,3 May 2019,Overlong and cheesy in the extreme. As a massive Avengers fan I was disappointed in the film. Who on earth decided to portray Thor as an overweight bloated drunkard?..That person should be hit with Thor's hammer. In a way I am glad that it has come to an end. It had become a money making machine at the expense of high octane adventure. Yes I will miss it but maybe not as much as I should!!!,6
Spoiler Free Review,4 May 2019,"Avengers: Endgame (SPOILER FREE) Review:

After the devastating events of Avengers: Infinity War (2018), the universe is in ruins. With the help of remaining allies, the Avengers assemble once more in order to undo Thanos' actions and restore order to the universe. Avengers: Endgame is literally one of, is not the, most anticipated film ever. This review is probably going to be shorter since its spoiler free and I have to be vague. I should have a spoiler review up soon (Monday is apparently the day we can talk about the spoilers according to the Russo Brothers). So this is a little late. I saw it last week Saturday and just saw it again last night. I wanted to see if it had the same effect as it did on first viewing. I'm pleased to say that I absolutely loved this film and even more than Infinity War. It's a great story that brings all 22 films in the Infinity Saga to a bittersweet end. The plot is much darker than any Marvel film. The first act was a drama where they're all realizing the events of what happened and it gets a good perspective for the audience. We saw in Infinity War that it affected the superheroes and some people but it makes us all think of the entire universe. It's tragic really. This is also when we get the most character development in any of the films. We see their true feelings. Now I could go on and on about how there wasn't a single bad performance by anyone, but I would like to talk about one. I'm currently on the petition that Robert Downey Jr. should get an Oscar nomination or at least a Golden Globe nomination for his performance. I believe this is his peak performance and he put all his emotions into it. The scenes at the beginning and end are his best though. Some brought me to tears. It's a very emotional film and I don't know how one could go in to it with at least tearing up. So Stephen McFeely and Christopher Markus, amazing job with the script. No line felt out of place. Everything came off natural. And also the Russo Brothers did their finest work directing and they're some of the best right now. There's so much to say about those but that's all I can say without giving it away. Now for the technical aspects. Alan Silvestri's score was interesting and beautiful because it had the original melodies like the previous Avengers films but this time he created new melodies that, for me at least, are just as memorable as the Avengers Theme. Also my favorite score of the year so far. The visual effects were good as usual and worked well with the chaos of the action, especially the final battle. Speaking of battles some say you could leave for the action since it's all the same and there was too much going on, but I strongly disagree. There is no time to get up and leave during this film. The cinematography was at its best of the franchise with Trent Opaloch as the cinematographer. And I think I'll leave my review at that. For more content I will have my spoiler review soon. I think this was an amazing film that brings the series all together. I'm pleased to say I liked it more than Infinity War and it's my favorite film of the year just beating Us. Therefore this is my first perfect film of the year. Please go see it if you haven't. I think this film is special and one you can never forget.

My Grade: A+",10
"It was what I expected, but that's all.",24 April 2019,"The movie was great, there's no doubt about it, but that was it. Coming off the shock value that Infinity War brought meant that nothing in this film surprised me, actually there really wasn't any surprises- everything was just as you'd expect it, which was slightly disappointing in itself. I remember after infinity war, people in the cinema were speechless, crying, sobbing, hugging each other - there was nothing like that here. I wish there were more surprises. It was also a little slow overall but at the same time a good celebration of the last 11 years.",7
Watched Guardians again to get bad taste out of my...,1 May 2019,"But I never liked super hero movies to to begin with and got suckered in by a couple good Marvel movies.

Before the smartest guys in the milky way start talking about the loopholes in the time travel theory let me tell you that this is a comic book movie and not a time travel documentary so please take it with a pinch of salt..

Polarizing... did not live up to my expectations,24 April 2019,"No spoilers.

The movie had a nice closing of the past 10 years but is far from the best Marvel movie which I had hoped for.

Infinity war is head and shoulders above it due to its high pace and perfect character combinations. Endgame is funny, emotional and provides more depth to main character heroes. However, leaves so many important things out of focus despite its 3 hour runtime. Also, surprisngly feels like the Russos missed many great opportunities to make the movie better.

Go and see it! Still important piece if the puzzle.",7
Zero story,18 May 2019,The movie is just very bad writing and is an epic failure for it lacks a coherent acceptable digestible fathomable sensible reasonable story or plot .. just sucks so bad that it hurts So much is wrong that I can't begin .. but for some reason people are lying .. even critics,2

Hmmmmmm that's a NO from me!,2 May 2019,"There must be a lot of brainless fan boys highly rating this movie ... compared to its predecessor (Infinity War) Endgame was a real let down. I won't reveal spoilers. But I will say the pacing was very bad.... very very slow at the start to the point I was nodding off in the theatre .... the movie before had great pacing of action, drama and comedy...... Endgames first half was just boring. Also balance of heroes in the first movie was done much better than this movie which really should have been called Captain America & Iron Man + Avengers. And time travel as a plot device is a very lazy way of solving issues ... I cringed when that came up ........ Thanos and his lieutenants were a threat in Infinity War... in this movie they felt really dumbed down.",6

1 in a 14.000.605..,24 April 2019,"After seeing all the 22 movies and some of them even twice I have to say that the last movie of the MCU was perfectly balanced in every aspect. Full of passion, drama, funny scenes, action... it has it all! An almost flawless scenario that left me stumbled by its depth and ode in logike. This scenario along with the coordination of the Russo Brothers (another proof that brotherhood collaboration excels) truly inspired all actors involved for a great performance. All these years of participations in different movies also enable them all to surpass themselves in acting. That's the success on the MCU in my opinion along with a clearly anthropocentric approach to the character of its heroes .Of course with such an amount of actors playing there will have been some cliques projected more during the film, but their unification under one roof was excellent. Thumbs up also for actor's discretion on leaks on the script.

To be honest after I watched with much anticipation Avengers Infinity War in which I have to say I expected more in terms of fights among characters like in the comic books (maybe I was biased due to the numerous action-based trailers), I was prepared for a good but not special endgame. But on the contrary as Red Skull would say ""We all think we were prepared.. we were all wrong!""

A mind elevation for children, a new dimension of sentimental fulfillment for adults.. Best entertaining three hours I had in years! I just wish we had even some more! Especially in the movie's action scenes, I had such goosebumps only from classic trilogy like Wachowski Bros Matrix or in the Star Wars clone war.

Must SEE 10/10.",10

"Avengers: Endgame, it's Oscar time!",24 April 2019,"It's time for the MCU to get the recognition it deserves. Endgame is a masterpiece, well written, acted and directed. No need for the Oscars in 2020, just give all the awards to the Avengers cast and crew.",10
Avenge The Fallen,11 May 2019,"I've grown up with the MCU with Iron Man coming out when I was 5 years old. I love this series and it's sad that the main saga is over but I expected a bit more. I gave Infinity War a 9/10 because of its amazing pace, fun characters and unexpected gut-wrenching ending, but this film has sluggish and inconsistent pacing, ruined character arcs (like Hulk as in IW he was afraid to even show himself but now they sorted everything out... Off screen), and a very predictable story and ending. I'm not even joking when I say that (even though my prediction was slightly different) my prediction to the film was extremely accurate to the films events.

To conclude, I watched Infinity War 3 times in cinemas and who knows how many times on Blu-Ray, but I've only seen Endgame once and have no intention of seeing it again anytime soon: I liked it, but was overall disappointed.",7
Random junk.,1 August 2019,"Horrible, wrapping things up for the sake of wrapping things up. Random stuff thrown together with no meaning or story.",1
The best conclusion to a decade of wonders.,24 April 2019,"I have been giving thoughts if I should still write about Avengers: Endgame. My brain is just blacked out. I cannot think of anything. Maybe because the movie left me broken after seeing it. And I'm afraid that if I try to remember the scenes from the movie, I might end up crying.

I felt sad after watching Infinity War, but Endgame just rips your heart out.

I was very silent after the movie. I went straight home after watching it. I can't handle it. I just watched the most anticipated movie of 2019 and the excitement and anticipation were replaced with too many emotions that is very impossible to contain. I thought I was ready to watch it, but I wasn't.

I haven't written a review that doesn't contain spoilers, so I would like this to be different. And it's really hard to write without spoiling the movie if the very core of the movie is how we are attached to the characters all over these years. We have been rooting for them for too long and seeing the conclusion of the franchise is giving us mixed emotions. All good feelings, I assure you but as I mentioned too much to contain.

I will watch it again, not to be broken again, but because this movie might be our last connection to the characters we ever love. (You'll know when you see the movie.)

I'm sending this warning to all MCU fans who haven't seen it. Be very ready for every possible and impossible thing that might happen because this movie will give you an emotional blow. You will clap. You will jump. You will shout. You will cheer. You will cry. And heck, you will weep. I know I did. #AvengersEndgame #EndgameReview",10

"A nice ""fan service"" send off film, but far too over-hyped",19 May 2019,"Let's get this straight from the start: Infinity War is far more entertaining and a better film overall.

Endgame is a nice way to send off the storyline with a fan service movie, giving some nice nostalgia for the previous Marvel films in the series and the characters we've come to know and love, but there are many problems with the overall plot and film itself.

It would take quite a while to go in to it in too much detail, but to put it simply: Infinity War was also a long movie, but never felt long. I check my watch after what turned out to be 1 hour of Endgame and couldn't believe there was still another 2 hours to go.

It's possible I'd hyped it up to myself too much beforehand, but even then, plot points would have annoyed me regardless. I'd say the overall feelings afterwards were: nostalgic, sad (I admit to some tears), happy, ""it was alright""... but ultimately a little disappointing and frustrating.",6

Time Travel is the ultimate Deus Ex Machina,29 July 2019,"Say goodbye to any semblance of a plot which is tied to character. This is not it. Bad writing and concept, probably born of corporate and committee-led ""creation teams"" has made these movies not into entertainment but just more fan service. When outrageous plot developments have no consequences because they can just be ""undone"" with time travel, the writers have no incentive to connect characters to decisions which permanently affect plot. The result is an empty but spectacular show full of glitter, movement, and noise. This is fine if that's what you wanted to see, but this is not a film about characters, despite its shallow attempts to bring it in for this or that moment (again, reversing all those character traits at a moments notice when it's convenient). It's disturbing to see fans rating this with 10's and ""best film ever"". One wonders if any kind of story is necessary at all to get the ""Wow"" reaction. Still, I applaud the filmmaker's efforts to add enough time to spotlight some of the characters, even if those efforts are in the end, transitory and a character mirage, to be forgotten, so that the big reset can take place. In this at least it is true to comics, and in that sense, this is a typical bit of bad comic plotting converted into film, so if praise is deserved for being true to mediocrity, at least they earned their 10/10 in that respect. Marvel movies are to film what Professional Wrestling is to the Olympics -- corrupt, shallow, and based on cheap thrills -- and worth watching only if that's what you came to see.",7

Less than 8? You're miserable and bitter!,14 August 2019,"I appreciate many desperate people want to seem ""edgy"" or ""alternative"" by defining themselves as ""different"" but really, you come off as nothing more than the representation of inadequacy. I'm not suggesting you need to love this movie or that you can't find fault, but what this and it's predecessor, Infinity War, achieved; not only in cinema, but storytelling as a whole, is laudable. This is not a stand-alone movie and requires some foreknowledge, but it's an accomplished endgame of a movie arc of over 10 years unlike any other in movie history",10
Amazing film. Emotional rollercoaster,29 April 2019,For a 3hr film it flies by. Ties up the MCU nicely and the best film I have seen in a while. Highly recommend,10

THE Endgame,26 April 2019,,10
Too much... Quite the stretch,5 May 2019,Infinity War was much better. This movie was all over the place and lazy. They reduced Thor and Hulk to an absolute joke.,6
Cheap sentimentalism and plot all over the place,13 May 2019,"This was supposed to be the final movie that crowed the franchise and Infinity War set high expectations. I was utterly disappointed. The plot doesn't make sense and throws away a lot of character development, to the point that some of them are just shallow version of what they were in other movies (and could become).

But what really annoyed me was the sentimentalism that permeated the whole movie. It is like you have to shed a tear for every character and the movie is trying to make you cry in scenes that don't move the plot forward. If in Infinity War they really stroke a good balance between action and emotion, here they just are there for the sake of it.",2
👌,7 May 2019,Robert Downey JR needs an Oscar. Fantastic performance,9
The best MCU film by far,24 April 2019,"This film is the conclusion of the infinity saga series containing all 22 films for the past 10 years. Plotwise is great. It's a great storytelling. Few scenes are weird but acceptable. Marry Sue? Very few. OP? Just very few. It's reasonable and fun to watch every minutes. Nebula's arc is good and the actress is great. Every 6 main character's arcs including Ant-man are decent. There are shocks and twists but reasonable also. Characters from the past return and add very good additional contexts. The screenwriters, directors and producers made a good job. The CGI is good and realistic. The acting is world class. Many characters but they lifts up each other in the good way. Every actors are great. I can see myself go back to watch it ten times, and I can do this all day. Enjoy :) I actually rate this movie 9.6/10, but lean towards 10.",10

Time to play the (end)game,7 May 2019,"I usually do not watch movies twice in such a short amount of time. But after I did the Double Feature (at the Midnight premiere) with Infinity War almost 2 weeks ago, I re-watched Endgame yesterday and it was as amazing as my first impression of it was! And while I will not spoil anything about Endgame, I will talk about things Infinity War! So if you have not seen that yet, do not blame me for anything revealed here.

My summary is a pop culture reference and there are quite a few in the Marvel movies, hinting at other franchises (Alien got name checked for example in Infinity War and even ""copied"" or ""homaged"" if you will and there are a few in Endgame too). But those little digs are not too important, they are just nice touches for those who know them. Having an understanding of the MCU as a whole, from Phase 1 to now Phase 3 is way more important. And as someone who is not too familiar with the comics myself, I can tell you that knowing the movies is enough to enjoy the franchise.

Still you can google the other stuff or even make your own conclusions. Now that is a lot of foreword and I haven't even gotten one word about Endgame. But as I said above, no spoilers here. What we do know (from the trailers) is the beginning. But whatever we saw and thought we knew - what happens not even half an hour into the movie, will rattle you. Now what?

Yes the first hour of the movie is ""slow"", but it had to be. There are ramifications after the snap and the characters we learned to love, that we have close to our heart, have been torn apart. Quite literally gone with the wind - everyone is thinking how is this going to be resolved (no pun intended)? And the movie will give you answers, and will even try to sort of explain things that are quite - unexplainable.

And while there is full on drama, there is still a lot of humor. The movie takes beloved characters and does things to them - or rather the weight of what happened does things to them. What exactly? Well that would be telling, but let me tell you some very bold choices have been made. And if you are not emotional at least during some scenes, you are taking away a lot of fun for yourself.

I can be a cynic too at times, but taking this apart (which you can do with every movie), is only hurting your own viewing pleasure. There is so much love in this, for the characters, for details, for the fans - it's just a rollercoaster and I'm not afraid to say that I shed a couple of tears. It is after all tying knots and bringing certain things to a conclusion.

That doesn't mean there isn't anything more coming (because we know there is, next up Spiderman as an in between movie before Infinity War?). And there are some familiar faces coming back to Endgame from other movies that we haven't seen in a while but also new cameos like Ken Jeong. I'm guessing there will be a deleted scene with him, his scene seems to short for storytelling purposes I reckon.

Epic fights, epic emotions and dialog that is hinting at things to come later in the movie ... which you will see even clearer with repeat viewing(s) ... The Russos did it - Kudos to them, Kevin Feige, Stan Lee (RIP) and everyone else involved in this of course

Edit: Endgame works even for people who have not seen a single MCU movie yet (confirmed by a friend of mine). But of course the gravitas and the conclusions of everything will work way better if you have seen the rest of the movies. Also let me add that this is ""technically sound"" as some would put it - or just plain great visually speaking. But I reckon this is a given anyway. Popcorn (or Nachos or whatever you prefer) to perfection",10
Simply stunning!,25 April 2019,,10
It has all come to this,26 April 2019,"It has taken many years and lots of work to build up to this amazing movie. This completely satisfied and exceeded my expectations for how I hoped they would pull this all off. I have been a huge fan of the movies leading up to this and this did it all justice. All the hidden ""Easter eggs"" from the other installments have been hinting towards this and I can't believe how big this has all gotten over the years. I was glad to see that even though this movie had a very serious fight at hand that there was still some classic Marvel comedy that made for some very funny moments. There was laughter, tears, and cheers through this movie. It was an emotional roller coaster that I already plan on going to again soon in theaters. It is a must see for those who have already been fans of the MCU and if you haven't followed it to this point this movie won't make sense or mean much to you so go back and watch the other movies. It is all worth it.",8
Couldn't Be Better!!,24 April 2019,There are so many surprises and twists in this film. I believe it's really a perfect ending for the first decade of MCU!! Couldn't be better!!,10
PLEASE give us the Secret Wars...with all the marvel heroes,25 April 2019,"I did not expect to see in my life such a faithful rendition of my childhood heroes from the comics to the big screen ... the emotions was huge ... the only reason I kept and did not cry in the cinema was because I was shy not to see me ... . From Athens Greece Thank you STAN LEE for filling my childhood with those fantastic stories and heroes ,also Russo and marvel because you have respected our comic heroes on the big screen ... my only sadness is that we could not see avengers together with XMEN- fantastic four -Daredevil in the same movie, but you can not have it all at life",10
Mediocre,30 April 2019,"Mediocre Revamp of old stuff, waste of time, okay ending.",6
The Russo Brothers did it,24 April 2019,"I didn't think this could surpass Infinity War but the Russo Brothers did it. Very few highly-anticipated movies live up to the hype, but Avengers: Endgame managed to do it. It's the perfect follow up to Infinity War, and I'll go so far as to say, maybe even the absolute pinnacle of the Marvel franchise. It's both hilarious and emotionally engaging (there were people crying at my theatre including me). And while it's a lot more character focused than Infinity War, as it should be considering this is the final hurrah for many of the original Avengers, that doesn't mean it's lacking In terms of visuals. The film is an absolute spectacle to behold, it easily tops Infinity War's action sequences in my opinion and even though it's three hours long, it doesn't feel bloated.

10/10 best Marvel movie in my opinion. It's honestly hard for me to see how they'll ever be able to top this one.",10

It's just ok.,30 April 2019,"I'm a HUGE Marvel fan and have been so excited for this movie, and to be honest, I'm disappointed. It was a decent movie, and I was invested in the story, but it was no where near my expectations.

This movie was way too over hyped and in my opinion, messy. Humor was good, emotion was there (at the end), and concept was cool. But, ruined certain character arcs, was poorly executed, and was not worth the hype I gave it before seeing it.

There were moments that made me very emotional, laugh, and made me jump with excitement which is all a plus. I came out of the theater crying a mix of happy and sad tears, but the more I think about it, there were so many flaws (mostly to do with character arcs). It was so fast paced with the characters and ruined the genuine connection we built with them in past movies. It's almost like they're completely different people. All in all, it was an ending we won't forget... even though it kind of flopped.",6
Worst movie of the year,1 May 2019,This movie is so long and boring don't understand where the hype is! Not any close to infinity war! Senseless! Please save your 3hrs! Trust me,1
AN EPIC CONCLUSION!!!,30 April 2019,"Breathtaking. Endgame raises the bar so high. The emotion, comedy and action all combined to produce a movie of epic proportions that probably won't be matched for many years to come! The best MCU movie. Easily one of my all time Top 5 favs.",10
I'm convinced people who have poor reviews didn't understand the movie,26 April 2019,"NO SPOILERS First off, the timeline in this movie is flawless. The absolute best, most coherent and consistent time travel use in any movie. The complaints in these reviews completely misunderstood how it worked.

Second, the other complaint is Thor. Was he weaker? Yeah. Was I disappointed? Yeah, but it follows the progression of his character. He lost his whole family, swore revenge, almost saved the day and missed it by a foot. His demise into self loathing makes perfect sense and allows other characters to shine in battles. Thor tends to be overpowered so this leveled the playing field.

Third, the pacing is slow and ponderous. But it asks you to follow the characters and their emotions and reactions to the snap. The slow pace allows the characterization to shine and not be overblown by tedious fighting like some scenes in Infinity War.

Overall, I don't get people's desire for overpowered characters with aimless action scenes. Endgame does a great job creating small moments for personality and giving everyone a chance to shine in battle.",10

This 3 hour flick was supposed to be the biggest one yet and there was so little. The fun finally kicks in after 2 hours and 15 minutes. Everything before that was pretty boring. It's honestly not as ""amazing"" as people made it out to be. It was genuinely a one-and-done movie. Don't get me wrong I like some of the MCU movies, but I had a better time with Infinity War than with this installment. I don't think I could see myself paying for this movie again any time soon.",7

A bit self-indulgent,29 April 2019,"Infinity war was a tough act to follow; ultimately nothing was likely to be sufficient as a closing act. Disregarding plot holes, which don't really matter to much in an action film, there are a few aspects which brought the film low.

The movie is very self-indulgent with fan service. A little is fine, but it's a massive component in this movie.

There's Ragnarok-level humour, which will undoubtedly be to the tastes of many - just not mine.

The film is very slow to get off the ground. That's fine as long as there is some real substance, but it's lacking.

Characters have been handicapped in order to curb the power creep, where as others are momentarily escalated in ability. This is not uncommon, but very noticeable in this flick due to the volume.

Of course, you're going to see it regardless; don't go in sky-high expectations and you'll probably have a good time.",6
Ending in an ending,7 August 2019,"As much as we might miss some of the characters who died in Infinity war, this avengers movie was not necessary. The story ended perfectly in last movie. I feel that this was an effort to bring back lost characters for whom most of the little boys and girls cried for in last movie... and in doing so, making tons of mistakes and dynamics change that made it near unwatchable. As much as it upsets people, Thanos was always right. And this was just a sad attempt in making him the unreasonable bad guy... sad.",3
10/10 only if you have followed the MCU,29 April 2019,"A movie bigger than this has never been made or attempted. Critics who do not appreciate the movie or say its 'just another superhero movie' take this movie alone. This is NOT a standalone movie, its a closing to a spectacular franchise and it was satisfying on so many levels, I cant even explain. There were so many moments in the movie that made one appreciate the depth of character, backstory,human bonding, sacrifice and ofcourse comedy and action, that I cannot even point them out even if I wanted to.

To enjoy the movie, at least watch most of the MCU movies. This is the movie of the decade and you WILL ENJOY THIS",10
"Disneys Dark Knight Rises, by way of Inception.",28 April 2019,"I'll start by saying before Infinity War, I always thought that most Marvel films were a 6 or 7 out of 10 for me, they were all enjoyable, however the thing they so drastically lacked was a strong baddie. My issue with the first Avengers was Loki being so non threatening, and everyone I talk to about this seems to agree, however the breakthrough at the time was just to have all their heroes on screen together. You then had Avengers Age of Ultron, which had the baddie being a creation of Tony Stark, which I found unexciting, despite it being a fun watch. The two impressive Captain America sequels, the third of which had our heroes fighting against each other, again something I found to be a little underwhelming.

Then came Infinity War, which for me totally raised the bar, and properly introduced one of the most threatening, and in my opinion Iconic baddies we have seen on the screen since Nolans Bane in TDKR. I was extremely dissapointed to not see more people dressed up as the mad titan last Halloween (no shortage of Harley Quinns and Jokers still). Infinity War ended with what is unquestionably the greatest shock in superhero film history, which then set up what promised to be a fascinating follow up.

This film did not disappoint, and even if you are not a fan of superhero movies in general, I would strongly urge any film fan to at least watch both Infinity War and Endgame both. I am certain even the most hard nosed film critic (the type that boo every film at Cannes) can appreciate the quality of film-making on display here.

I have seem some passionate YouTubers making videos about plot-holes being uncovered throughout this film, however given the direction the story took, I can imagine the difficulty the filmmakers had weaving this all together, and I am confident they did the best they could.

Essential viewing.",9
One Time Watch Not Enough,21 February 2024,"In a big marvel fan. This movie is something that i have enjoyed from first to last. So thrilling exciting every bit worth it. The action is honestly some of the finest in the history of cinema. This film's world-renowned final battle is riveting, heartbreaking, awe-inspiring, and exceptionally well choreographed. Never before have I been so thoroughly moved and elated while watching a battle scene in a film. The film's soundtrack is also one of the best of its kind and brilliantly complements the action. It is filled with some of the most stunning, blood-pumping, and epic music themes you will EVER hear.",8

Fitting finale to our superhero's,28 April 2019,"For the past 11 years MCU has been increasing their fan base across the globe with larger than life characters. Avengers : End Game: With the expectations sky high, the Russo brothers delivered a fitting finale to this franchise. What worked: 1. The emotions were very well connected with the audience. 2. Jaw dropping CGI and VFX. 3. The last battle.

What could have been better: 1. Screenplay a bit slow. 2. The war sequence could have been a bit lengthier.

Overall, this experience is for a life time and hence everyone should enjoy this wonder movie in IMAX",8
A fitting climax,5 May 2019,"Well, it finally happened: I got emotional during a Marvel movie. Sorry, not sorry. This film truly was a fitting conclusion to a decade of MCU films. While it was a classic action sequel, it was also filled with surprises, homages, laughs, and emotional moments. Unfortunately, that's a LOT to accomplish in one movie (hence the 3 hour runtime). Fortunately, almost all of it worked. They wanted to bring 22 movies to an epic climax...mission accomplished. I'm not sure that I would put this one alongside the best stand alone MCU chapters (Winter Soldier, Black Panther, Ragnarok, Iron Man, etc.), but it somehow pulled all those movies together in a pretty magical way. I complain a lot about the comic book-ification of film, but I can also recognize the accomplishment that is the MCU.",7

As the name it's the Endgame.,22 March 2024,"Avengers: Endgame is the finale to a decade-long journey of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It brings together many heroes from other movies to fight a big battle against Thanos, a very strong enemy. This movie continues the story from Avengers: Infinity War, where half of all living things disappeared.

The movie is like a wild ride with lots of different feelings. There are exciting fight scenes, sad farewells, and funny surprises. The directors, Anthony and Joe Russo, made a story that finishes up all the earlier stories and also shows respect to all the movies that came before. The actors do a great job, especially Robert Downey Jr. As Iron Man and Chris Evans as Captain America.

Endgame is a special movie for the fans who love these heroes and their adventures. It's about being brave, doing hard things for others, and working together. The fight scenes are amazing to watch, and the special effects are really good.

Avengers: Endgame is a great ending to a story that has made superhero movies very popular. It's a movie that finishes the story in a way that will make you remember it for a long time. It's a must-see movie for people who love super hero movies.",10

They captured every moment perfectly. I really can not put into words just how fantastic this film is!,10
"Infinity war was better, but this was still really good.",3 May 2019,"I agree with many other reviews in that this Avengers is over hyped. However, this movie IS STILL REALLY GOOD. I think a lot of people are giving it bad reviews because people had too high of expectations. Infinty War was a lot more action-packed and became a legendary film partly because Thanos's victory had such a large ""wow factor"" to it. In terms of pure enjoyment, infinity war takes the cake. However, the plot to endgame is really good and the action scenes are still pretty amazing.

Honestly, my main disappointment with this movie is what they did to Thor's character. Thor was an amazing character in IW but in endgame he is kind of pathetic, DESPITE becoming one of the most powerful avengers by the end of IW. Personally, I wish they had found a better way to use Thor's character in this movie.",8
Averagers,26 April 2019,"It's a fine action movie for one time, jokes are good too. However, it lacks something that Infinity War had. As anyone else I've been waiting for the greatest hit the entire year. It's sad to admit but I left the theater with a feeling of disatisfaction.",6
I Will Probably Take Heat For My Review,3 May 2019,,8
Nothing special,7 June 2019,"Actually, I can't understand why that many people enjoyed this movie so much. It's boring, illogical, predictable etc. Just an average movie about superheroes. The first part was much better in any aspect.

Perhaps it's worth watching one time, but no more.",6
Major Disappointment,6 May 2019,,2
Welcome to the Fan Service. How can I please you Sir/Mam?,25 April 2019,,8
Avengers: Endgame,24 April 2019,"I hardly think anyone could fairly admit to disappointment after experiencing the sufficiently bombastic, tearful and wacky conclusion to a decade of Marvel content that delivers on every promise and gives (as others have stated before me) back to the fans in a very unique way.

The entire movie is a spoiler. That said...there isn't a whole lot more TO say. If Infinity War was your cup of tea, Endgame is going to do everything you want it to... but not in the way you expect it to. Yes, there's a measure of predictability; but there's also plenty of surprises - a mix of both, really, which feels just about right.

My feelings a few hours after seeing Endgame are as follows: Sad, a little depressed that some things will never be the same going forward. I know all good earthly things have an end - sometimes it's a little difficult to accept. In a way, the good ol' days are now officially ""old"". On the flip side of the coin, I'm a little exuberant about the possibilities opened up, the new concepts explored, and probably more than anything, the completely perfect fanfare that had the folks at my cinema cheering and applauding at every turn. In other words, I'm experiencing mixed emotions. Decipher my very cryptic notes as you will... but see Endgame for yourself. It's hardly something to be missed. And it's hardly something to be forgotten.

Some people move on. But not us.

Not us.",8
Marvel-lous,6 May 2019,It can't get better than this. Best MCU and Marvel movie IMO.,9
"Good, but not as good as Infinity War",1 May 2019,"Alot of things could have been done better. The whole film is based on a time-travel idea that Antman came up with and Antman doesn't get enough credit or time in the film. Hawkeye gets more time in the film! Who cares about Hawkeye?! Slow in parts. Reminds me of Avengers Assemble, most of the film is build up to a final, end of film battle. Much preferred Infinity Wars pace, energy and action-packedness. Infinity War made me so excited for Endgame. Endgame made me want to rewatch Infinity War.",8
Absolute epicosity,5 May 2019,No amount of words can explain this rollercoaster of emotions 😱😱😱😱😱😱,10
WOW,13 March 2023,"""Avengers: Endgame"" (2019) is the final film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe's Infinity Saga, and it brings to a close the storylines of many of the franchise's most beloved characters. The film takes the audience on a journey through time and space, as the surviving Avengers attempt to restore order to the universe and defeat the evil Thanos.

The themes of sacrifice, friendship, and the power of hope are at the forefront of the film, and the filmmakers handle these themes with the care and respect that the characters and their arcs deserve. The tone of the film is grandiose and epic, with moments of levity and humor to balance the film's more serious moments.

The acting is, as always, superb, with standout performances from the entire cast. Robert Downey Jr. Brings a sense of closure to his decade-long portrayal of Tony Stark, while Chris Evans delivers a powerful farewell to his character Steve Rogers.

The score is fitting and emotive, adding to the film's overall sense of grandeur and importance. The cinematography is stunning, capturing the scope and scale of the film's epic battles and locations.

The production design is outstanding, with each set piece and location looking like they have been lifted straight from the pages of a comic book. The special effects are, as always, state-of-the-art, and the film's final battle is a visual feast. The editing is smooth, keeping the film's pace moving at a breakneck speed, while the dialog is sharp and witty.

Overall, ""Avengers: Endgame"" is a fitting conclusion to the Marvel Cinematic Universe's Infinity Saga and a love letter to fans of the franchise.

The greatest achievement in the whole history of movie making!,25 April 2019,,10
Too much,27 April 2019,Part 1 of the 2 final movies was perfect. Character development was still going forward. Endgame is nothing but a screen full of the characters we have come to know and love. It tried to tell too much so what we ended up with was clips and a lot of jumping around. It was like a movie made up of movie preview clips. What a let down after all these years.,9
Avengers Endgame - An Epic Conclusion To The 21 Movies In The MCU,3 May 2019,"First off, a great applause to the members (Director, Writers, Crews, Cast etc..) behind the extraordinary movie. Avengers Endgame is a terrific example of that epic intimacy that Marvel does so well - alternating between glorious action and subtle character moments. Watching it almost feels like taking a wistful walk down memory lane, flanked on either side by a Russo brothers, our hands held firmly in theirs. . It was a perfect ""ending"" of the 21 Movies.

The story highlights the original Avengers team. Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Hulk, Black Widow and Hawkeye are at the center of events. No character comes in front of them. The best thing that happened in the movie was the heroic sacrifice. They captured the emotion perfectly. Favorite heroes once again experienced side by side and you feel it, you are completely absorbed in a hurricane of events and you are watching it in one breath.

Everyone had the chance to shine even if it's the smallest way possible. There were so many character arcs in this movie and none of them were cut short or boring. Every scene is in the movie was worth digesting and deciphering, along with the surprises and the twists and turns that will get audiences on the edge of their seat. The direction focuses more on the emotional side of the characters and story. While delivering an epic climatic showdown that will have you grasping and excited.

Overall, Avengers: Endgame is a great and awesome superhero film. It is one of the best finales that Joe and Anthony Russo have delivered. Thank you stan lee for making the superheroes ....",10
My rating of endgame 3000 out of 10,5 May 2019,When I saw Endgame and Carol came on screen with her new haircut the gay in me actually moaned in the theater so loud my mom sitting next to me had to tell me to call down,10
10/10!!!!,14 May 2019,Hands off to the last of MCU movies. This whole storyline was a masterpiece. I am going to see these movies again and again and again I will never stop. Thank you Marvel,10
Ok,5 May 2019,,7
Unpredictable,25 April 2019,"This movie gonna lead you about a teamwork even you're not useful in team. With a jokes and laugh. While watch it maybe you guess the way of the stories but sorry, what's really happening are so different and unpredictable",10
Not better than Infinity war or the best Marvel movie ever,1 May 2019,"Movie is full of action, but even for that I wait last 30 min when the movie Will be over, cause it didn't have hype to keep me exciting. Characters are great written. Some Characters as Thor and Hulk are much different that we been seen them before. Fight scenes and acting are better in Infinity war.For example:when Thor come in Wakanda in Infinity war. Story line is great, but have some gaps. In this movie Cap. American and Iron man are in front plan. In this movie Thor is so so different and almost act like a girl. This is to big turn over for such musculine and strongest character of all Avengers.on moment it looks like this is Cap America or Iron man movie. I expect much more after media advertising.",7

"MARVEL ,LOVE YOU 3000 TIMES",25 April 2019,"Objectively, if this movie is produced by any other studio no matter in which country,it won't get a score of 10. But the thing is I can never be rational about MARVEL. Avengers:Endgame indeed give MARVEL's as well as my last 11 years a satisfying ending.This movie is a milestone in the film industry, I doubt if we'll be able to see another movie like this any time sooner, so I really suggest that people,especially MARVEL fans enjoy this movie to the fullest for the highly likely vaccany of this type of film in the next decade or even decades.

In Avengers:Endgame, we waved goodbye to some of our favorite chracters and we may never see them in MCU again. But one thing I do know is that the examples these heroes set for us and their spirits will never die, and their successors will bring us more surprises.

I will never forget the eleven years in which in grew up with MCU ,and I hope it'll always be with me in the future.

As for MARVEL and all the superheroes that have left us ,love you 3000 times until eternity",10
Defiantly recommend,3 October 2019,I seen this in the theaters and let me tell you this was the most mixed emotion movie ever this movie had me crying especially at the end and there were some parts that were heart raceing and another part were it was funny so all around i supper recommend to watch this movie it will have you in love it has alot of action,10

avengers endgame review,1 May 2019,,7
AVENGERS ENDGAME : AWESOMETECULAR AND FANTABULOUS,25 April 2019,"A Malaysian reviewer here. Screening on the 24th April 2019 and All i can say it is a behemoth undertaking compiling 21 or so films, expanding over 11 years of MCU phase 1 and phase 2 universe. How the heck are they going to pull this off? Questions arise and questions being answered with a 3 hour long movie. Its a good solid 3 hour marvel movie.

A good slow pace on the first part showing human vulnerability on superheroes. Even superheroes need emotional support from someone. Its is nice to see Hawkeye got some good character scene compared to his last/ previous involvement.

Second part comes the built up whereby it is fun to see how they interact with previous marvel films. (note to those don't follow MCU universe) You really need to see few previous marvel films to understand further what i am talking about.

The Third act is the final act whereby the brothers did a terrific job giving what fans wanted. An awesome (+/-)45 minutes battle that exceed my expectation. Crazy visual effect/ CGI . Such an eye candy to see on the big screen.

All i can say this movie is well worth the 11 years of waiting and the screenwriters and directors did very well in showing off the maturity of marvel MCU films. It is like having all favorite songs and compile it as your greatest hits. This is how endgame felt like to me. It is just so freaking awesoommeeeeeeeeeee",8
"A slower, but action packed Infinity War",29 April 2019,"I very much loved this movie, though the beginning act was very slow and drawn out making the film almost boring. The second and third act saved the movie as those were the best parts.",7
Such a let down 😪,13 May 2019,"I am a huge Marvel fan and have loved the previous Avengers films so went with high Hope's for this, unfortunately I was disappointed beyond belief. Long, slow, dull scences make up most of the movie with only about 10 minutes of actual action. Main characters are sidetracked for less popular ones and the whole film moves at a snail's pace. It really felt like they had run out of ideas and this is just a money making film. So, so let down and would not recommend.. recommend it to anyone",2
I hope future generations understand and feel what I felt watching it !,27 April 2019,"We have laughed, cried and rejoiced during the whole journey of 22 movies and have lived through them.

Here's to Us who witness the end of an ERA !!!",10
Greatest Cinematic experience,15 May 2020,"Endgame is a fan based movie, only MCU fans gonna like it. This movie is the greatest superhero fantasy movie, a perfect ending for generation. There is lots of goosebumps moments, lots of oh my God moments, wtf moments. Especially the last 30 minutes you will see the greatest Cinematic war,some upsets for fans. Avengers endgame will be remembered as one of the greatest movie.",10
"Perfectly balanced, as all things should be.",27 May 2019,"Reading through some of the low mark reviews from what one can only presume are DC fans I can assure the hand full of people whom are yet to see this movie that this is without any doubt a masterpiece in modern movie making. I've read comments on how the first third of the film is 'too slow' but this is totally necessary due the need to portray the weight of devastation caused by the snap from the end of the Infinity War instalment, as a stand alone movie it's quite the spectacle however to truly appreciate it I would recommend seeing all the previous MCU movies from the past 10 years chronological to truly benefit from all the call backs. Go see it, buy it, marvel at it and maybe DC can learn a thing or two from it.",10

PERFECT!,25 April 2019,"In life, I believe there is VERY LITTLE things that are either NEAR perfection or ARE perfection....

If I could give a strong firm handshake to each individual who worked on that movie, I would.

They did it. They have made something that is so PERFECT that I may start questioning my own reality on how something could be so good.

Watch Endgame. You will experience MANY things throughout the movie....But....Regret will NOT be one of them....",10
Avengers: Endgame,16 May 2020,"What I like: it's a good ending. It's connected with the previous plot. It's about the past and the future, reality and memory, emotion and choice.

Endgame!,5 May 2019,,7
Endgame lacks the intangibles: the magic and the fun of infinity War.,3 May 2019,"They did such a great job with infinity War that Endgame wasn't able to deliver on the same level with the added pressure of being the grand finale. Part of the problem I think was that the story was developed to such a large-scale that was hard not to be so episodic, although it probably could have been done a lot better without losing the pacing with long, drawn out and sometimes awkward scenes.

Some of the scenes felt like the writers didn't know which direction to go with characters and the direction they chose was not quite right. Endgame lacked a lot of the slick and fun banter that made the characters shine in previous movies. The writers had their moments but a lot of it could be pretty cringe-worthy at times.

I get that everyone needed therapy after Infinity War but it felt a little too depressing for too long. All in all end game was a a good movie and it's evident that that Disney tried to put everything but the kitchen sink in this movie to please the fans which is appreciated. But I would have loved to have seen them spend more time crafting and polishing this into the Crown Jewel it's supposed to be rather than an uncut diamond.",8
heavyweight which punches below it's weight!,15 September 2019,Avengers endgame one of the most anticipated movies of 2019 was watchable. The story was way too predictable except the ending.

VFX was great, Marvel has not compromised with its VFX. The best Avengers movie when compared with the other three. A visual treat for all the Marvel fans. Loved it.",10
Review from a Comicbook Guy,5 May 2019,"Every time I get drawn into a discussion on a comicbook adaptation I will invariably utter the phrase ""Well, in the books...""

I'm an old fan of the genre, having read many of the books that are being adapted now as a child. I get very nit-picky when a film strays too far from its source material. The MCU broke me of that. Gradually over the years I accepted new ideas, if introduced in a good way. The details can be mailable, so long as a core theme is adhered to.

I walked into Endgame today having no idea what could happen, and no preconceptions about what should happen. The previous 21 (wow) movies all took their source materials in different ways, for better or worse. In the end the source gets a nod, but the characters remain faithful, which was the case here.

Nothing of the sequence of events could have been predicted by me, a man whose read the original Infinity Stones series, and that was for the best. If I knew what was going to happen, it wouldn't have made for an enjoyable experience.

What I watched was a denouement of an impressive 11 year, 22 film series, the likes of which happening again are extremely remote. I was filled with so much emotion by the end, alternating from cheering to sniffling, I walked out knowing only that I'll be going to see it once more while it is in theater just so I can properly digest what I saw.

If you are watching this movie never having seen the previous films (meaning you've been living under a rock for a decade) you won't understand a thing that happens. But as a closing to a series, you could not have expected a better experience.

'Nuff said.",10
Truly a definion of a super hero movie.,26 April 2019,"It was an epic, funny & emotional conclusion to the 11 years of the MCU. It's probably one of the most 'comic booky' film next to Spider Verse.",10
Perfect. Yes. It was perfect!,27 April 2019,"No spoilers here. 22 movies, 11 years, and multiple story arcs to tie together. A MASSIVE and record breaking task. Not only that, but I was expecting a lot and got MORE than what I expected. Infinity war was incomplete (on purpose). Unfortunately it just didn't feel like a complete story. This movie is a complete story in and of itself, and it ties in well. More action, more acting, good humor, and TIME TRAVEL!! Also, no credit scenes. This is the end of the current Avengers saga as we know it. Expect teasers for the next team, but don't expect any hints of the next saga's story.",10
Feelings are mixed.,2 May 2019,"The movie is fun and entertaining overall. But it is supposed to tie up all the loose ends of the previous films of this franchise, which contradicts with a lot of plots of this particular film. Maybe we should just turn a blind eye and give it a pass because this ending can't be more epic or whatever, but this is the one movie we've waited for so long for me to say like, that's such a great way to tie it up and all. Because it's not. There are so many inconsistencies and cringy moments in this movie. And it doesn't give me the feeling of Infinity War or Cival War. The level of conflict is just not there. So to sum it up, it is kinda enjoyable as a comedy, but I'm personally not satisfied in a whole bunch of ways.",7

Best movie of 2019!,5 May 2019,"Avengers Endgame is a masterpiece! The Russo brothers have nailed this epic conclusion to the Infinity Saga. This movie exceeded all of my expectations and so much more... I'm really happy with the how to Russo brothers handled the aftermath of the decimation and how the remaining avengers move on from this devastating event.

Overall, the movie had amazing visual effects, epic soundtracks, amazing cast and this movie is a must-watch for all marvel fans..

Loved every second of the movie and give it a 10/10

Thank you Marvel, the Russo brothers, the cast and the crew of endgame for making this movie my favourite comic book movie ever!",10
Beyond worth the hype,10 July 2019,"Avengers: Endgame (2019) BROKE MY SCALE 20/10



""A finale so masterfully constructed, Avengers: Endgame proves to us that a finale WILL do whatever it takes to treat the fans with an emotionally moving, action-packed masterpiece.""



I am just blown away by how well Endgame does for itself. My expectations were stacked, and the film somehow managed to surpass those expectations. Like Infinity War, Endgame manages to strategically balance the humor with the seriousness of specific aspects, you'll either be laughing or crying, or both at certain points. The action still stands out as a fair product of entertainment, going to the extremity of any situation, no matter how impossible it may have seemed; taking risky moves to get the film's point across the table. Lastly, the characters are so well written in this, sometimes its just hard to believe that our original heroes conclude their stories in this tearjerking finale; it really is hard to say goodbye sometimes when we've grown on these characters since day one. I can even say that Thanos' character is basically given the upgrade in sociopathic motive, making him somewhat unpredictable just like the predecessor. The film does have its minimalistic flaws (like any other film) but I felt that these flaws are completely ineffective towards the the whole idea of what points the film intends to display.

Verdict: Avengers: Endgame marks the end of an era that lasted 11 years. It concludes a story so fashionably well, its safe to say to bring the tissue and bring the applause, because there's no way in hell anyone was prepared for this epic finale.

One more thing, I'd like to thank everyone who was involved in the making of Endgame (especially the Russo Brothers), and anyone who contributed to the build up to this conclusion we've all waited for. And a final thank you to the man himself, Stan Lee, for showing us that the real heroes are the fans because WE made it happen. May he rest in peace, thank you for reading folks.",10

But the more I thought about it the more weak points I could spot. There were some scenes that made me feel very angry, like all the stuff they have done to my favourite hero Thor. It was funny at first but later it just got on my nerves and made me (and all other fans of him) aggressive. There were also some scenes where the writers just found conclusion that were too easy compared to the problems that had been there. The movie also had some holes in its plot and things that just didn't seem very logic. But the start was great and all in all Marvel delivered very well.

I will never be so hyped again for a movie in general. This is the perfect conclusion for a 10 years old saga. It closes the arches of the main characters and opens some for the new ones. The battle scenes are awesome, the themes too, perfect character narration and development. Maybe the plot is a little bit simple and predictable, but sometimes you don't need a complex one to do a perfect movie. You can't judge a movie only by one aspect of itself. Infinity war was the ACTION part, endgame was the FEELINGS part. Yes, infinity war was better, but this movie also has its moments.

Maybe the best film I have ever seen,15 July 2019,"This movie is a complete masterpiece! It is excellently acted, directed, and animated. It is an amazing payoff of all the previous marvel movies coming together.",10
"3,000/10",24 July 2019,"Though it has been repeated time and time again, it is still quite insane to think about an end to 11 years and 22 movies. A cinematic universe that for quite a few of us, we have grown up with. A universe that despite all the bad that may have gone on in one's life or in the world, we could always look forward to one day out of the year where we could escape that and enjoy 2 hours of watching our childhood heroes kick butt on the silver screen. A cinematic universe, that I quite frankly thought was impossible to successfully conclude, until the Russo Brothers proved me wrong. Any way you slice it, Avengers Endgame should go down as one of the toughest movies to write. Bringing a true and satisfying ending to 11 years of stories in a universe where the death is never truly accepted, the cast size seems never-ending, and an overabundance of story arcs could drive any writer insane should prove a near impossible task. Yet here we are as smart, conscious decisions are made throughout the movie. The reduced team size allows for a focus both character and story wise that makes it a movie easy to follow (for the most part) despite still being among the most ambitious Marvel movies. Surprise callbacks and fan-service moments act like a Greatest Hits album giving fans a true appreciation for the greatness of the Infinity Saga. Despite the temptation to just rely on these callbacks, where the film truly shines like any other Marvel movie is with its characters. Through the course of the 4,5, and 6 movies the Original Six Avengers have appeared in, several decisions have been made that not only affected each character but changed their overall perspectives. The Russo Brothers dedication to these characters is seen in the masterfully crafted scenes that continue or conclude the appropriate arcs. All while still producing shots, scenes, and moments that created the best cinematic experience I have ever had. To put it simply, for 3 hours I simply got to be a 10-year-old cheering, laughing, and crying with the heroes that I have grown up with, idolized, and loved for my whole life. For that I thank the entire Marvel family!",10

A beautiful movie that meets the hyped crowd,2 May 2019,"Imma be honest: I was afraid this movie would be boring, overly sentimental and poorly written, but luckily IT IS NONE OF THOSE THINGS!! They managed to fill the surprisingly long run-time without boring the audience, and the plot managed to round up the character's stories very well. I was happy when I left the theatre even though the movie obviously had some sad parts. Before seeing it, I was worried I had hyped myself too much and would be disappointed, but instead I am glad that it ended in such a perfect way. Anyone who claims otherwise should be burned alive.",10
A fitting and moving end to the story.,16 October 2019,"A fitting end to a 22 movie story. It is not a full blown action packed Avengers movie, but what it does, and it does it very well, is wrap up everything in close to 3 hours with respect to everything that's gone before it. No spoilers here, but you'll enjoy the action, laugh at the humour and it will (probably) make you sad in parts. Loved the last couple of scenes especially. It's unusual to be able to watch 2 excellent films in 1 week (Joker being the other).",10

More Clarification,26 April 2019,"As of now, after about 100K reviews the average user rating for Avengers: Endgame sits at 9.2. Infinity War, after about 620K, has an 8.5. I like where this assessment stands and hope it doesn't change much, as more user ratings flood in.

I point this out for all the negative reviews citing how Infinity War was far superior to Endgame and that Endgame was such garbage and flawed. This is without a doubt a case of the criticisms saying much more about the critic than what they are saying about the film. Perhaps their own disposition and attitudes prevent them from a positive perception. They are certainly entitled to their pretentiousness and to feel cheated, but their petulance is their OWN responsibility. Much to the chagrin of this minority, the majority has not only embraced what Endgame is, but for the time being placed it above Infinity War.

I say this because I tire of the arrogance and contempt in people that behave as though they could have written or produced a better result than what they paid to see. Many of those that love to review or critique, think it en vogue or trendy to be incredulous, negative, or never be satisfied.

I'm happy to see that the majority of viewers were satisfied and more than content with Avengers: Endgame. IMO, complaining and rating the film sub par requires a great amount of cynicism and disenchantment. IMO, if you allow plot holes or whatever other discrepancies found in the film, to ruin it or leave you sour and disappointed, then you probably tend to create your own misery in life in life anyway.

There's nothing wrong with having a personal opinion or particular disposition. I do however think it important to put disillusionment and negativity in its proper place, to achieve objective perspective. So again, according to imdb user review, Infinity War is at 8.5 and Endgame is at 9.2 and holding. I'll check back on the consensus in a few months after further reviews.",10

All time best superhero movie,24 April 2019,"What an end to an epic series. A roller coaster of action, humour and emotions.",10
The End,29 January 2022,"The finale of the lengthy series featuring a constellation of Marvel's luminaries, ""Avengers: Endgame"" is a watchable superhero flick that merges real life interactions and explosive fantasy. Featuring A-List stars Robert Downey Jr., Chris Hemsworth, Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo and Scarlett Johansson as Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, The Hulk and Black Widow respectively the film finds our heroes in the eternal tale of the battle between good and evil and some stones. Decent acting with simple but adequate special effects help carry the view. The biggest snag of the whole enterprise is its length. Clocking in at three hours the span strains an already shaky script and the mature viewer's patience. Perhaps I've long outgrown Fantasy movies and seeing full grown men and women in skimpy outfits playing cartoon characters challenged belief and the overall silliness of it can't be shaken off. Maybe it's not just me; the bored, going through the motions look of the actors especially at the start of the film seems to mirror this. The thought of having to wear those tight stretchy outfits for the umpteenth time and having to memorize and utter those prepubescent lines were too much despite the hefty paycheck. A massive hit despite all of that, I still remember the loooooong lines in the cinemas to watch this and I guess the masses are basically dorks who'll embrace fantasies on the big screen to forget themselves and their lives. This is one to burn time with the kiddos and make you appreciate your soda and popcorn more.",7
Thors Bulling me,5 May 2019,,4

Satisfying Enough,1 March 2020,"The Russo brothers manage to conclude this chapter of the MCU in a satisfying enough way by exploring the effects of a post snap world and allowing a sense of finality.

The biggest thing against this movie is without a doubt its pacing. The first act overstays its welcome bogging down the beginning and leaving me feeling bored. The movie does however quicken up a bit which sadly gives way to minor story problems and a bit of an underwhelming conclusion.

I also felt that some arcs and pay offs were not properly followed up on, leading to some grievances and frustrations in terms of characters and movie set ups, though it is understandable why they would sideline some of these characters.

Endgame may not be infinity war in terms of quality but it achieves what it sets out to do albeit in some problematic aways.",6
A step down from INFINITY WAR,30 April 2019,"After seeing ENDGAME for the second time, I'm ready to write my review, which will be difficult to do without spoilers. I find it interesting that those who gave INFINITY WAR a 10 were disappointed in this movie and I think I know why (for I am one of them) - INFINITY WAR took so many characters, such different tones in the worlds of the different heroes, with such a big story arc, yet managed to tell real stories interweaving the larger story, not just 3 minute cameos. ENDGAME, although having real moments of pathos, missed that balance. Despite moments of humour (many at cost of Thor's character, which I didn't appreciate), this movie basically had one tone and I was disappointed how some of our heroes were marginalized (and given bad haircuts). I know it was the end of an era, a passing of the torch. As a friend put it, ""Character development was never the focus of this movie, that was what all the previous movies were for...it was a perfect wrap up and set up for the next arc."" I agree this was all about the ensemble but there were edits (or complete changes) to our heroes' journeys for which I didn't care (too many stories were left off screen) with one exception (Nebula has a character arc). So, that's why I didn't enjoy this as much as INFINITY WAR yet it was still a great movie with great performances by all the cast, poignant moments of loss, great montages in the battle scenes and a real challenge demanding great cost. Kudos to the Russos and Kevin Feige for their hands at the tiller for this era. I give this film an 8 (great) out of 10. {Superheroes Action Adventure}",8
A good conclusion but not quite great,29 April 2019,"One of the main reasons why this movie is only a 7 is because of the super high expectations and how excited I was for this. So for me it was kind of a let down but not just because of the hype. Personally the pacing was just God awful, and it's not because it's a little slow to start, but it's the massive amount of jumps the film takes. I can watch slow movies with a build up, but when everything changes so quickly and then goes back to slow repetitively it creates an frustrating feeling. The movie also has many unexplained plot holes, with most movies this is fine, but when you need to know the details (which are very important for marvel films) then it hits the plot a lot. I also feel like the movie tried too hard to be emotional. There was no need for the way it ended or the sad spots in between. Not to mention, the cgi on captain marvel looks great. Still a good better then average movie, but not the best ever.",7

The Hype Is Real,26 April 2019,This movie was an excellent film that fulfills expectations and maintains a serious tone but doesn't fail to make you laugh.

The bad reviews often overlook the culture and environment this film gives easy 20/10,10

madly overrated,4 May 2019,"Come on people. Why is every Marvel movie so overrated? I rate them as what they deserve. Infinity War was pretty much the only outstanding movie in the franchise. They did something what noone dared before. That was a very good movie.

This one? 7 at best. How on Earth can anyone just a little bit of brain rate this higher over movies Inception, Matrix, Goodfellas, etc almost the whole top250 movies. Are you mad? For real..

This one was full of nonsense. They basicly setup something that shows and tells you who's how strong. When they show in the end of Infinity War that Thor now can beat Thanos easily, then how comes that he still has all the power but Thanos now can rip him apart without a single stone.

Glad it is finally ended. Sick of seeing every trash being in the top250 because of little fan boys that haven't even seen sh**.",7

This movie takes multiple unexpected turns. When this movie unfolds you surprisingly get to learn more about the characters that survived the Snap. MCU took a different style of storytelling which was very risky for a marvel movie, but they pulled it off. If you are thinking of watching this movie, I strongly recommend that you stay away from as many spoilers as possible. Trust me, the less you know about the movie the more you will love it. Go see it ASAP. I love it 3000.",8
I have no words for this masterpiece,15 September 2019,"I am totally blown away! The whole summer I sat and watched through the whole MCU and was so hyped for Endgame. It didn't disappoint. I love how great the balance between action and emotional character scenes was. And the character development! I don't understand why everyone criticize Hawkeyes development, cuz it was great. I love how he has gone from a totally boring action character in avengers 1 to a character you cared about. He made me cry so many times. That's a point too. I cried so much, and I have a hard time crying when I watch movies. And the time travel aspect that got so much critic. I love how they actually made a great thing about the quantum realm. When I watched Ant-man I thought about this, and finally! And the ending of Captain America... I have literally not cried so much in my whole life. What a great ending to one of the greatest humans of history! It's just one thing though, you have to be a marvel and watch the whole mcu before to understand. But I'm a marvel nerd, so I'm pleased! Go watch it right now, and prepare to become emotional and lose your whole supply off tears!",10
It doesn't get any better than this,26 April 2019,"To say this movie was awesome is an understatement. I'm still processing everything but OMG was it truly a masterpiece. I'm struggling to think if I've ever given a 10 before, but if I have it's only ever been one or two in my life. This certainly was a 10... However you definitely need to see ALL the movies from 2008's Iron Man through Infinity war. And I do mean ALL of them for this movie to truly shine or even to make sense. Even given the 3 hour running time this movie makes no attempts to fill you in, and nor should it. You need to be well prepared going into this

That said I saw the opening night fan event showing, and got a commemorative coin that is actually metal, heavy, and super cool! But it was shown in a regular theater with mediocre sound, so I also have tickets for a showing on Friday as well in a Dolby theater room, which I can't wait to see. Now I loved Avengers Infinity War, but I laughed, cheered and got way more emotional in this movie than that one. I've been in theaters where the crowd cheered or laughed before, but I don't think I've ever seen it let alone experienced it to this degree. The emotions were just flowing to say the least.

I really liked how the first act brought you into the aftermath of this post-snap world, and really focused on the hardship of what things would have been like after such an event. And while this was all very sad the one thing I was shocked about was that they successfully pulled off so much humor. Humor in a marvel movie is no surprise, but given how Infinity War ended I really thought this was going to be a dark and dreary movie, and yet it gave me some of the best laughs while still taking itself serious. It's quite a magic act to pull off

The second act really sets the game plan in motion for how they plan to ""fix"" things and while suspenseful and intriguing it still kept up great and appropriate humor. Obviously humor is a subjective thing and some might bash it. I tend not to like potty humor style but more organic or situational humor, which I thought they just nailed. But at the same time there were some heartache moments that just brought you on the edge of your seat, or made you wipe your eyes. Towards the middle of the movie I was just glued to my seat

And then there's the third act. OMG... As you would expect it sets up a mega finish as they really are wrapping up the culmination of 11 years and 20+ films worth of story lines and this is what it's all about. The action was great, effects second to none, a bit chaotic at times but that just adds to the intensity. There were moments I just yelled and cheered like I never have at a movie before. I watched it with my daughter who I've taken to or seen every one of the marvel movies with and we were clenching each other through the last 15-20 minutes as it was just so intense, amazing and emotional.

Coming out of the movie we were both just stunned and in awe, just trying to process the emotions of what we just saw. To bring out so much emotion in us, and from what we saw so many others is just unbelievable. That in itself just tells you how extraordinary this movie was and is a true credit to everyone involved in making this film. All I can say is don't read any spoilers as there are sure to be some now that it's out. Get some tickets, go and see it for yourself, you will not regret it, but again if you've missed any of the movies in between Iron Man and Infinity war, get caught up first.",10
Not as good as everybody says!,12 May 2019,"Don't know what all the hype was about! The film is one hour too long because there just wasn't enough action. The Hulk was not so ""Incredible"" & Thor was not much of a ""God"" I was rather perplexed by how underutilised some of the characters were given the powers they have. The ending had potential, but unfortunately it failed to deliver. It's good but not great.",6
Unreal,15 September 2019,Never thought that a superhero movie could make me as emotional as this one did. RDJ's turn as IronMan was brilliant. To see the character develop from the first IronMan movie to this iteration was a journey well worth taking. And to have the story wrap up with all the characters and plot lines coming together was mind-blowing. A modern classic that sucks you in from the word go.,10
Infinity War was better.,29 April 2019,"I will not tell you anything about the plot, simply because almost everything in it can be considered as a spoiler, but I can convey my attitude. It was neither good nor bad.

The plot is linear, simple and predictable. Classic Marvel.

There was a lot of humor in the movie. Too much, especially considering the atmosphere of loss and hopelessness, which was at the end of the ""Infinity War"" and which one is trying to get to believe here.

And I liked the final action scene.

So in fact, I have nothing more to say about this movie. An entire era has passed. This is just the end.

This is endgame.",6
"Pointless, stupid, cringeworthy and downright boring",7 August 2019,"...and if I lasted more than an hour, I'd probably come up with more adjectives

this is THE worst superhero movie in a line of really bad films. all the 'old' cast (who reeeaally got older throughout the marvel cineverse) looks like they've just came to get their final paycheck. it just feels forced, like a bad commercial, or like a prog rock song that should've ended few minutes ago. none of what we see makes any sense, there's no sensible plot , even ""fun stuff"" comes off as rather sad. and that's the word that describes the final (?) avengers movie the best way - sad...",3

The Masterpiece of MCU,5 September 2019,"One of the greatest movies I've ever seen. The plots really stunned me. It's a filled with everything that a movie should have. Great respect to Joe and Anthony and the full credit goes to the father of MCU, Stan Lee 😍😍😍",10
"Avengers: Endgame is not only a truly engrossing culmination to the 'Infinity Saga', it is also nothing short of a cinematic masterpiece.",25 April 2019,"""This is going to work, Steve.""

""I know it will. Because I don't know what I'm going to do if it doesn't.""

So spoke Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) to Captain America (Chris Evans) in the opening act of Avengers: Endgame. Quite poetically, leading into this crossover event, the above interaction no doubt reflects the minds of all Marvel fans flooding to see Endgame in the coming weeks. Naturally, fans are longing to watch their favourite characters together on screen for one last blast, but also desperate that the conclusion to this incredible 11-year journey lives up to expectations.

Endgame's prologue sees our heroes defeated; Thanos' (Josh Brolin) infamous finger-snap at the end of Avengers: Infinity War - coined officially as 'The Decimation' - has wiped out half of all living creatures in the universe. Now, the Avengers must unite one more time to reverse this grave catastrophe, ""whatever it takes.""

So, has Marvel managed to make this overwhelmingly ambitious project ""work""? The short answer: yes. Infinite times over, yes. Avengers: Endgame is not only a truly engrossing culmination to the 'Infinity Saga', it is also nothing short of a cinematic masterpiece.

The journey that began with Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) in Iron Man back in 2008 is very intelligently tied up in Endgame. As the film unfolds, Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely's meticulous story planning becomes evident and gradually proves to be the most satisfying payoff any Marvel fan could have hoped for. Marvel President Kevin Feige alongside directors Anthony and Joe Russo have completed an impossible feat; Endgame is humorous, heart-breaking and perpetually captivating. It more than exceeds any presupposition laid before it with a swagger more equanimous than Stark's ego, whilst also moulding an open route forward for the inevitable continuation of this formidable franchise. It's one-of-a-kind experience; the perfect milestone to end this gigantic adventure, yet a glorious beginning for the future of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

Endgame's greatest filmic achievement though, lies in its steady pace and indulgent narrative; taking things slow but never wasting time, yet speeding along whilst never rushing, everything fits perfectly into place in this 3-hour work of genius with a sophistication indicative of a Francis Ford Coppola paragon. Sure, it's a high-budget superhero blockbuster featuring spectacular special effects, but as Marvel has proven before, that doesn't mean a superhero film cannot tackle tones and styles not necessarily affiliated with the genre. In the realisation of its ambition, Endgame catapults the superhero genre to an unprecedented spectrum of film accomplishment; it is quite frankly a piece of cinematic art, encapsulating yet conquering all that has come before it with majesty and self-assuredness.

But as noted by Stark, ""part of the journey is the end"", and now the curtain draws on this dazzling superhero adventure. Though the encore of 'Phase Three' is yet to be seen in Spider-Man: Far From Home (releasing this July), Avengers: Endgame is a magnificent finale which allows The Avengers we so know and love the opportunity to sign off in remarkable fashion, leaving behind a Hulk-sized stamp on Hollywood history which will remain for 'infinity'.

Avengers... Assemble. And take a bow.",10

It's no wonder it's the most anticipated superhero movie of all times, and no wonder why it has grossed so much. The movie promised to be awesome and was an understatement. If you like superheroes like me, you're gonna love it. Never before had so many heroes appeared together and, finally, working as a team.

I Am Iron Man!!,29 December 2019,,9
Mediocre,28 April 2019,In my opinion this was a huge dissappointment for me. The movie lacks of action and full of irrational content. Its very slow and boring. First half was unnecessary and second half is below par. Im so sad that nearly nothing significant happened in whole 180 minutes. I was expecting the same vibe as infinity war or dark knight but this was more like age of ultron.,6
Cerebral diarrhea,4 August 2019,"The previous episode was , ad least entertaining ...this one is just SO boring and sometimes so depressing ...3 hours trying not to yawn and more difficult , not to fall asleep ( Hopefully the fluctuation of the sound level between dialog scene and action one help me not to ! )

PS : there's a good new , though , it's supposed to be the last one !",3
Watching this in theaters is incomparable,22 October 2021,"Maybe not the best mcu movie, but the one I find the most satisfying. Watching this in theaters for the first time was truly an experience. This is essentially 3 separate movies- a post apocalyptic drama (act 1), a time heist (act 2), and an epic (act 3). It may not hold up as well on rewatch, but there is nothing like watching this movie for the first time.",9
I LOVE YOU 3000,20 December 2021,"Avengers: Endgame is a depressing and emotional conclusion of the long awaiting Infinity Saga. The final product is not what I had hoped for, but the Russo Brothers created something special that reflex the wholesome of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

This film marks the end of an era for some of our beloved characters that we cherished and loved. Going down memory lane is not an easy task, but we sit through 181 minutes to say goodbye to our favorite Avenger. A proper farewell is necessary for Tony Stark and Robert Downey Jr. Because he helped to build this franchise juggernaut that reaping billions at the box office.

As the first Avenger and leader of the world's mightiest heroes, Steve Rogers will always be the patron saint of the MCU. Chris Evans helped to shape Captain America as the poster boy for American patriotism and his departure will leave a huge gap and we can hope that his new successor will continue his path of righteousness and compassion.

Avengers: Endgame failed Black Widow and she deserves better.",8

Better and Worse Than I Could Have Ever Imagined!,24 April 2019,"I've just returned from watching Avengers: Endgame on opening night. As a fan of Marvel for over three decades I had many expectations and thoughts about what this movie might bring, and this movie was nothing that I expected. It brought us both the best (and worst in my opinion) versions of Earth's mightiest heroes. And I'm sure that many out there will disagree with me on which is which. What is undeniable is that the Russo's have managed to achieve what many (including myself) thought impossible, to deliver a film which pays tribute to the past decade's 21 (not including Endgame itself) Marvel Cinematic Universe offerings, whilst simultaneously closing out the story lines and creating an epic masterpiece in itself. It has humour (some of good), action, emotion and genuinely something for everyone all rolled up into an epic three hours of entertainment, which goes by in a flash. Well done, fantastic work.

Thanos, it's Hammertime!",10

Childish,28 May 2019,,1
Outstanding,28 April 2019,"Without doubt one of the best films I've ever seen. I was completely gripped from the beginning. Fantastic performances by all of the cast (not that we'd expect any less), I find it hard to pick a favourite character because they're all so awesome, in this film more so than ever. I was on the edge of my seat throughout all of the action sequences, and have known few films to evoke such intense feelings of hope, and also great sadness/ loss. The humour throughout the film is spot on, and in one of the most important final scenes you could have heard a pin drop in the cinema, it was like everybody was holding their breath - staring at the screen in complete disbelief. As far as I can tell, no one saw that coming which is a credit to the writers and directors who were able to piece everything together so cleverly. It's an absolute masterpiece. Just one warning, though - if you're anything like me you'll need to go armed with tissues.",10

10 years of continuity concluded in a near perfect film.,25 April 2019,"It was always going to be a challenge to create a movie that neatly ties up a decade of continuity and juggles a cast of characters built up over 22 films and the fear was that End Game was going to be anticlimactic. Fans do not fear, the Russo's have crafted a near perfect film from its heart wrenching opening to its close. You'll laugh, you'll cheer, you'll weep and you'll leave the cinema pretty happy with the experience. If you are new to the Marvel Universe then this is not for you and will appear to be a jumbled mess of a film but for anyone who has been in the Marvel Cinematic Universe since Iron Man back in 2008 this is everything you wanted to see.",9
A Mesmerising experience!!,27 April 2019,"AVENGERS : ENDGAME

A Humongous tribute to the characters Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) and Captain Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) for being a vital part in Marvel Cinematic Universe.Never seen such a huge franchise paying a proper payoff to these characters.

Do not watch Endgame untill you watch all the marvel films starting from Ironman to Infinity war.

First half of the movie travels at a slower pace because this flick contains a phenomenal story and character arc built for the powerpacked other half.

Different dimensions of Capt'n and Thor characters were shown to the audience. Which will keep the them excited throughout the movie.

Directors Russo brothers came up with an epic cinematic ending. The determination and conviction for such a complex screenplay by Christopher Markus and Stephen Mcfeely has to be appreciated.

We as an audience would have presumed that this film would end in a certain way. But, there are lot other Easter eggs and jaw dropping scenes which excites us and also make us whimper.

Overall, with Avengers : Endgame, there is really something that comes to an end. BTW keep your tissues handy!!",10

Why not made it 240 minutes, I enjoyed every minute every second of this brilliant movie.

I loved this movie absolutely did.

I hope gwyneth paltrow returns in future as rescue I really loved her as the superhero it totally suited her.

This movie is groundbreakingly gorgeous.

It's also emotionally sad but also exciting.

These actors are also very down to earth in real life and really nice friendly people.

Gwyneth paltrow must return as rescue it would really look cool and awesome.

Have fun and forget immeaditely,22 June 2019,,1
"Perfect Conclusion, for now at least, of the Avengers Storyline!!!",24 August 2019,"I was a little late watching this one and had heard a lot of mixed reviews leading up to doing so; however, I personally thought this was the best possible conclusion to the current Avengers storyline. Or... the conclusion for now at least.

First of all, I really enjoyed getting to see a more human side of all the Avengers in this one. I thought the film makers did an amazing job at really giving us the time to connect with each and every super hero in this franchise if we hadn't thus far. Doing so really helped set the stage for the ""Endgame"", if you will. I really enjoyed the main characters throughout this film as well. I thought Thanos had wiped out the majority of my favorites with his infinity stone snap, but I was really surprised at how much I enjoyed the remaining characters and how well they worked together throughout the film.

Also, I just can't say enough about how beautiful the Marvel films are and how well the CGI, costumes, and FX are done. For a film series that relies so heavily on FX and CGI, they manage to pull it off so smoothly and seamlessly.

It's hard to go too far with a review without giving away any of the storyline; however, I feel that any true fan has already seen the film at this point. For those who haven't I can only say to come out from under the rock you're living under and check out this amazing piece of cinema history.

I give Avengers: Endgame a 9 out of 10!!!

PS - Captain Marvel is soooooo badass!!!!",9
Everything Leads to this,20 June 2021,"What a cinema experience. Saw this opening night and the cheering that erupted at certain points gave instant goosebumps. A couple of legendary moments in the movie that I will never forget. Nothing has come close and I feel like nothing else ever will. Over 20 movies have led to this, and Endgame delivered big time.

There really isn't much else to say. The movie is packed full of every emotion. One simply has to have made the great journey to appreciate this masterpiece. This is the peak of the MCU and I fear it will only decline, but time will tell.",10
You just can't ask for a better ending.,27 April 2019,"Well, the magnificent saga ends with a such great and satisfying conclusion which gives you the best cinematic experience of your life. Unexpected, brilliant and an all together masterpiece.",10

"Best MCU movie ever made, Expect The Unexpected Ending. Perfect Ending (9/10)",24 April 2019,"I am waiting for this movie from the day I watched Avengers Assemble movie in 2012... Perfect Ending.

There is no movie such grand in past or in recent times, not even star wars( sorry fans but its the fact). Marvel put every trick possible in this movie. I laughed, I got Thrilled and got Excited. Cried in the end and am happy while coming out of the cinema.

The makers tried their level best to portray such big story in 3hr time.... Even 3hrs are not enough to cover every detail, hence little flaws.",9
"Endgame sets the bar as high as it can possibly go for superhero epics. Brilliant, and worth every minute you've invested in the MCU since 2008.",24 April 2019,"THE LOW-DOWN: Statistically, the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) has achieved a great deal: over 11 years and 21 films, it has introduced dozens of relatively obscure characters into mainstream pop culture. More importantly, however, the franchise has proven that long-form storytelling can work in a cinematic context - as long as you balance plot with heart and humour, prizing character development over spectacle. That's no small feat, and it's even more remarkable that a movie with the gargantuan scale and ambition of Avengers: Endgame doesn't fall apart beneath the weight of an unwieldy script or great expectations. In fact, this is the MCU's crowning achievement: a heartfelt love letter to the Avengers, their stories, the actors who play them, and to the fans.

THE STORY: That damn Snap, eh? At the end of Avengers: Infinity War, Thanos wiped out half of the galaxy's population with a snap of his Infinity-Stone-enhanced fingers. After bearing witness to teammates and loved ones vanishing in swirls of dust and ash, the remaining Avengers struggle to live with the crippling grief and guilt of surviving the Snap... and of failing to prevent it. Some characters spiral into darkness; others are frozen in place - a few even manage to move on. But hope is rekindled when Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) returns from the mysterious Quantum Realm, where the usual laws of physics, space and time do not apply...

THE GREAT: Endgame is a storytelling triumph - not only does it bring together and pay off plots and ideas that were seeded over a decade ago, it builds solid, powerful, heartrendingly emotional narrative arcs for almost all of the original Avengers. Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) and Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) must grapple with their pasts to figure out their futures, while Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson) and Clint Barton (Jeremy Renner) find themselves literally fighting to save their families. Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) might provide much of the film's comic relief, but both characters are also gifted with grace notes, growth and moments of true peace.

THE SUPER-GREAT: The ability to juggle and create space for multiple perspectives and storylines in one film has been honed to a fine art by directors Anthony and Joe Russo and screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely. But their narrative strategy feels virtuosic in Endgame, paired as it is with an ingenious plot device that allows the film to truly acknowledge the staggering depth and breadth of its own history. Suddenly, the emotional and narrative stakes are raised, as beloved characters are forced to re-examine their lives, stories and priorities. You might find yourself in tears and in stitches, frequently in the same scene, and this happens throughout the film - a testament to the Russo Brothers' genius and their skills at anchoring even the most outlandish of storylines in humour and humanity.

THE NOT-SO-GREAT: This is emphatically not a film for casual viewers - there is no entry point, no easing in, no exposition, to help you understand what the heck is going on if you haven't watched most of the preceding films in the MCU. There are also a few logical fallacies and plotholes scattered throughout Endgame that will puzzle you the more you think about them - from the wobbly rules governing time travel to the fractured way in which the too-conveniently hyper-powered Carol Danvers (Brie Larson) pops in and out of the story.

STAN SERVICE: This film, above all others in the MCU, feels like a heartfelt tribute to the very concept of Marvel itself, finding numerous ways to reward and delight true-blue fans. Naturally, it includes Stan Lee's final appearance in the MCU, while folding in a host of other cameos and callbacks that reinforce the interconnectedness of the entire franchise - of all the stories that have been told before, especially the movie that started it all (Iron Man in 2008). There are even a couple of brilliant nods to comics lore, largely centred around the character of Captain America, that feel like the Russo Brothers are deliberately righting a few wrongs where some of Marvel Comics' more controversial plot twists are concerned. (See: Nick Spencer's run on Captain America: Steve Rogers.)

CAST-IRON MVP: Casting outside of the box has always been one of the MCU's core strengths, with Oscar winners/nominees and character actors regularly popping up to play heroes and villains alike. That canny casting strategy pays off in spades in Endgame - especially when certain characters have relatively limited screen time but manage to make it count anyway. The undisputed stars of the movie, however, are the Avengers who started it all. Hemsworth continues to brilliantly dance along the knife-edge between comedy and pathos, while Ruffalo radiates charm and intelligence through ever-improving CGI as Banner and his not-so-mean, green alter ego: The Hulk. Johansson and Renner are given more to do in this film than ever before, and their combined efforts will shred your soul to pieces. Evans brings great warmth and strength to his stoic role, making it perfectly legitimate for you to weep and whoop for a man who's - somewhat ridiculously - wrapped in an American flag. Above all, this double-whammy of Avengers films belongs, most fittingly, to Downey Jr. He still effortlessly injects Tony with snark and swagger, but also beautifully conveys every shade and layer of his character's hard-won growth and maturity - giving us all the proof that we have never needed that Tony Stark has a heart.

RECOMMENDED? In every imaginable way. Endgame sets the bar as high as it can possibly go for superhero epics that balance enormous scale and jaw-dropping ambition with actual substance and genuine emotion. It's the blockbuster movie event of our lifetimes, for very good reason - and it's worth every minute you've invested in the MCU since 2008.",10
Dont overhype yourself with these reviews.,1 May 2019,"Endgame is a fun movie to go see, it has its problems but is a fun movie. These reviews on here giving it 10 out of 10 and saying that is the first perfect movie are 100% wrong. Dont go in expecting this movie to be better than godfather or citizen kane as these reviews describe. It's a fun movie with fun action, no it's not an oscar contender, no it's not a ground breaking never before been done movie, and no it is not a 10 out of 10 perfect movie. Go in expecting a fun watch with some cringy comedy and you will enjoy the experience. But dont listen to the people saying that this is a perfect movie, or the best ever made.",6

The Best one yet!!!,24 April 2019,"People laughed, clapped their hands, some of them cried (including me). And what a satisfying ending, honestly this is best one yet.",10
An Honest Review,29 April 2019,"Walking in, given Marvel's latest publicity, I was expecting, well, I was expecting an absolute cringe fest, and thankfully I didn't get it. In fact, there were only a couple of absolute cringe moments and each dealt with Brie Larson, particularly her appearance in the final fight.

Thankfully though, Marvel showed a lot of restraint with that and as a result the movie really belonged to the characters that we all have invested over a decade of love and loyalty in....and honestly that was a relief. There were times where the film looked like it wanted to go the other way, and put the OG Avengers in the backseat. So, credit for not doing that.

It feels a lot more like Kill Bill 2 in atmosphere than a real Super-Hero movie, all the really fun big fights were reserved for the first film and what's left is a long closing act that is more concerned with tying up loose ends than delivering on over-the-top action. And it works for a send off film after a decade of investment.

So what you have feels very much like an intimate and sentimental film made by old friends at send off...or a funeral...but in either case it is absolutely appropriate.

Unfortunately, you have the enormously epic CGI battle at the end and I, for one, am kind of done with that trope. It's starting to bore me now, and, honestly, I would prefer something a little more authentic. But, that being said, the film at least called for it.

We've seen battles like that before, Black Panther, Aquaman, Infinity War, Lord of the Rings, and, honestly those CGI armies lack any real intimacy. So the end is kind of a bore compared to the rest of the film.

The highlight in the film would be Thor with Hulk coming in as a close second. They steal the show from the moment they are introduced and the trademark MCU humor that Black Panther and Captain Marvel utterly lacked. And the humor was a source of comfort after two films that made vague threats of taking themselves far too seriously for a superhero flick.

The wrap-up was more than satisfying if not heart-wrenching at moments making it a great send off for a decade of time and money invested in the characters, however the legacy that the MCU is passing on seems in trouble nonetheless and we can only hope that it doesn't go the route that the MCU has been teasing and toying with and continues to deliver fun superhero movies and not the heavy-handed or deadly serious films they have threatened the audience with.",10

Imagine one of your favorite Marvel characters having an awesome fight with some adversaries and the gigantic IMAX image on screen is cropped so that you see only the hero's head, shoulders, belt buckle and arms only up to the wrists because the baddie he or she is fighting is completely out of the frame. When you see the credits and see the leagues and leagues of artists who worked on this thing that were sacrificed on the pyre where they burned the steadicam or the glidecam and an editor that needs to cut from one place to another every two seconds and needed a strong sedative, you will long for a Spielberg, a Ridley Scott, a John Ford or a Hitchcock who knew how to frame things and didn't let the camera and editors run wild.",3

I'm excited. From the end of Part 3 at the latest, I was completely in the Avengers Universe. The action, the drama. Everything at a very high level, despite the many characters and superheroes. But the special thing about the Avengers is that directors Anthony Russo and Joe Russo are not afraid to break taboos. In part four it is tough and it rarely gets cheesy or boring.

The comparison is unfavorable, partly because GoT continues it very rushed approach to writing, but mainly because Endgame does it very well. The detail of the plotting is of course filled with holes that are best just to ignore, but the structure allows for a very nice conclusion as we retouch on moments from within the existing films, allowing nostalgia, references, and a sense of winding it up (although of course it will continue as long as the films make money). As with Infinity War, the writing somehow gives characters enough time despite there being so many of them; it hits several tones but none undercuts or takes away from another; and it mixes humor and action into a plot that takes itself seriously enough so it feels like it has weight.",10

From DC I liked Superman and maybe Batman and Flash... and that's it. In other words, I am not an American comics nerd and I do not watch all superheroes movies.

The first two Avengers movies su****. The bosses were lame and the superheroes were lame. But Infinity War introduced Thanos - finally a villain worthy of my interest. The movie was a 10/10.

Now, Endgame, this was an excellent movie. Despite not being a superheroes nerd, I truly enjoyed this film and thought it was made expertly. How the hel* did this not get a lot of Oscar nominations and some Oscar wins? How the hel* did Parasite win best picture, director, and why did Endgame not even get nominated for best cinematography and special effects? Crazy.

I spent countless hours reading theory's, watching YouTubers find Easter eggs and reading comics to help piece it all together.

I don't even care that some might not be as good as others, they all told one big story. Every single one of these films means so much to me and I can barely put into words the part they have played in my life. I found confidence in myself by having this amazing shared experience with so many others and I will never forget those incredible 10 years.

No matter where life may take me, these films are home.",10

Marvel did 10/10 Awesomee,26 April 2019,"No words to explain, but the movie is its own worth. 1000000 stars ✨.",10
Sometimes Imperfections Make Things Perfect,26 April 2019,"First off, I would like to get somethings off my chest. I'll admit, in terms of a pure film I feel that Infinity War was better as a whole than Endgame. I found Endgame to be quite predictable throughout and I felt that it suffered more with Marvel's usual pacing issues more so than IW. While enjoyable, I felt that this film pushed the comedic tones a little bit too much for my taste compared to the previous film and disrupted the overall balance.

However, this film still defied my already sky high expectations. Endgame did exactly what the title said.. it was the Endgame and boy was it a sight to behold. From the bombastic fight scenes and the intersecting complexities between each character, the film never ceased to excite. In many ways, what Endgame did right was it took the spectacle that was Infinity War and somehow took it to an even bigger notch. I found the film to be overall a lot more memorable than its previous counterpart. Throughout its 3 hour run time (which honestly didn't even feel like it, time felt like a breeze inside the theater), I felt that the film as a whole was much more compelling and contained more scenes that constantly put me in the edge.Such a statement is quite daring to make, but I felt that Endgame did an absolutely remarkable job in leaving so much distinct and vivid imagery. A film of this magnitude is meant to be a spectacle, an emotional joyride, and a bonafide table-setter all bundled into one roller coaster of a ride and such expectation was met tenfold.

What I also loved about Endgame was that it beautifully ended so many prominent character arcs, while also establishing the foundations for the new era of Marvel films. I especially loved all the subtle and not so subtle callbacks to the past films in the series, which is quite a treat for long time fans like me. These are not the easiest to achieve in film, but the Russo Brothers did an amazing job in piecing 11 years of cinema history in order to project the absolute perfect finale to one of the most iconic franchises in the history of cinema.

Overall, it's not a perfect film by any stretch but it's impossible not to give it a 10/10. Endgame is supposed to tie up all the loose ends and questions from the 23 other movies in the MCU, which it accomplishes beautifully. It isn't as fine polished and clean as IW, but it didn't need to be. Endgame set out to do the job and it passed with an array of flying colors. To all the twist and turns throughout the 11 years since the MCU was firmly described, I can easily say that one of the most epic nights of my life. Fans old and new fans can easily appreciate how epic of a film this is. Marvel knew what was needed to be done in terms of making the infinity saga happen and it was absolutely worth the wait. This era of the MCU is going to be surely missed and I cannot thank Marvel Studios enough for a hell of a ride. This might be the Endgame, but it has and will continue to be worth every second of anyone's time.",10
Snap.,9 July 2019,"I didn't expect to like this movie as much as I actually did, there were some scene I didn't even see them comming. I felt glue to the screen all the time, I even shed a tear, on thing I know for sure is that i'm a gonna miss a certain character..",10
Avengers endgame review,1 June 2020,,10
Preferred Infinity War,22 May 2019,"For me personally this film was just too darned long. As I sat watching it I suddenly realised against all hope and expectation that I was actually a little bored - a feeling I never got from its predecessor.

Visually it's stunning (as you'd expect) and I can see how to a great many people it has the ultimate wow factor but for me it doesn't quite hit the spot.

Personally I'm struggling to put it in my top 3 MCU movies.

I definitely prefer Infinity War and Guardians Of The Galaxy and then it's a toss up between this, Civil War, The Winter Soldier and Ragnarok.",7

Waste of time,12 May 2019,Don't believe the reviews. I suspect it's people paid to do positive reviews. Either that or I saw a different movie! Nothing much happens for 2 hours.

For the Fans 100%,6 May 2019,If you invested in all of the films that came before it then you will probably be very happy. Are there plot holes? Sure. Is anything in the movie probable at all in the real world? No. It's a movie. Go into it with an open mind and enjoy the ride. Nice job Russo's.,10
"Wow, this was disappointing.",24 April 2019,"Being a big fan of the Marvel Universe I was very disappointed to first sit through two hours of a very weird, boring and depressing Inception-like Movie. They had a lot of good ideas but didn't manage to make it a good movie. If you can just skip the first two hours and watch the ending. I was so pissed when the good parts came that I had a hard time really enjoying them.",6

"Excellent production, poor content",24 July 2019,"A tremendous production, with lame script, very obvious and almost boring time line, I hardly kept my eyes open to watch it to the end. The movie was also too long for the poor content. They could have told that sorry in 1,5 hours. Oh my God... and Thor... seriously? Is it a joke? And captain America holding his hammer... that finally destroyed the image of the great Thor. Pity!",3
Great!,6 November 2019,"The amazing fight scenes and CGI aren't enough to mask the fact that the overall plot of going back in time to change reality is just plain stupid and lazy - and this is addressed to the writers. I did know that there was gonna be some time travel involved, but the way Marvel explained and executed it didn't too well for me. They can't get away with just putting it all in ""Quantum.""",10

"It's good, but not the greatest marvel movie there ever was.",21 July 2019,"Flicking through the ratings I saw a lot of 1/10 and a lot of 10/10. For me, it was like any other avengers movie, it was kinda epic. But still, 10/10 is a bit overrated.

A lot of trends they inject into movies these days aggravate me. You can look at any superhero movie, Marvel or DC, since fortnite was booming it was somehow featured in the movies. The same can be said for political movements or protests/marches (LGBTQ-acceptance, feminism etc.). I don't mind them, but I don't need to be reminded of them by seeing them in every movie I go to watch.

I think that this is the movie for a passionate marvel-fan, but it isn't the end of the world if you don't see it.",8
Pretty much what was expected,24 April 2019,"Some really good hype moments here and there but the movie plays out like expected. It's sadly very far from Infinity War quality, 7/10.",7
More than a comic book movie,26 June 2019,"Endgame is the pinnacle of what is possible for the comic book genre, the 10 year infinity saga comes to a emotionally satisfying end.

AMAZAING,30 April 2019,"This movie was the best movie I have ever seen. Visuals, the actresses and actors, and plot. Everything linked up. I love this film and would recommend it to anyone.",2
A true crowd pleaser,30 June 2019,"There is one way to describe this movie and that is satisfying. It is satisfying in the way that everything you would want to see resolved is resolved and even things established in other movies have conclusions/payoffs. There are too many standout moments to count as everyone will have their own favorite moment. I don't know if we will ever see something like this ever again from marvel, but it is a movie that must be seen if you have invested your time in all these characters. You will not be disappointed",10
It All Ends Here...,3 May 2019,"After 11 years and 22 films, the Infinity Saga finally concludes with Avengers: Endgame. It's truly an experience to watch this in cinema, for the creativity, the emotional impact, surprises, and the fun this film brings. Despite the 182 minute run time, it is excellently paced and rarely has a feeling of dragging out for too long.

However, I only recommend this film to those individuals who have watched most if not all of the films prior to Avengers: Endgame in the Infinity Saga. A causal moviegoer may or may not enjoy it, but someone who has followed the saga from the very beginning will most likely appreciate this film for it is the finale after all.",8

Not the best MCU film out there.,28 April 2019,"This was a cool and fun film... but it did not meet expectations being that this was the grand finale we've all been waiting for... it had its epic moments and I laughed.. a lot.. but I just expected more.. especially after being blown away by Infinity War... this film was kinda a let down for me.. like most reviews already stated... they went a little to far with the humor. Some of the characters were just not the hero's we know and love... after all this waiting around for the biggest battle in MCU history.. it was short and not that exciting... I'm a huge Marvel fan... and as a fan.. for me at least... Marvels big finale was disappointing.... but, I gave it a 7 being that it was fun, seeing all the hero's on the big screen like that was great and it had its moments... but still a let down.. Thanks for reading.",6
Incredibly dull finale of an amazing franchise,5 May 2019,"The great thing about the Avengers-Franchise has always been this winning scheme:

1. A range of very different characters like Thor, Spidey and Strange, clashing together in witty and funny dialogues that showcases just how different they are. Spidey cracking jokes about deep philosophic insights of Strange, while Thor asks about beer.

2. Incredible fight scenes

3. Both may be linked by a variety of different narrative elements, from film-noir/detective over comedy to splatter.

It's an easy base recipe, that may be filled with any narrative strings, so long as they are intriguing.

Problem with the Avengers movies and the finale in particular is:

The winning scheme is NOT used and the narrative underlying is poor, at best.

They picked parts of a variety of comics (like the ""Thor get's irresponsible and fat""-plot), which is ok and linked them very poorly together. It's a series of short plots, loosely tied together with no red line (other than ""Thanos is the Endboss"").

Secondly, the acting is poor, apart from Iron Man of course! Even Chris Hemsworth and Scarlett Johanssen do a really bad job at depicting their character. The digitally animated raccoon is a highlight in terms of acting.

There is only ONE AVENGER-TYPICAL FIGHTSCENE, which is great, but does not make up for the rest.

Foot-Note: As a Non-American, the Glory-Halleluja-Murica focus on Cap is too much. If you're patriotic enough, you'll love it, of course.",2

It was a good movie..but not better then Infinity War,3 May 2019,,7
Saving the best for last,22 May 2019,"Everyone and their mother has likely talked about how this film is over a decade in the making so I won't bring that up to much except to say that this film, like Infinity War, relies on that history. And this is a good thing as it has a lot of new content that builds off that foundation. Avengers: Endgame is filled with some shocking twists, heart wrenching deaths, and amazing cinematic moments you will never forget. If you even slightly enjoy the Marvel films, you cannot pass up seeing this movie. If Infinity War was daring in using most of its run time for villain focus and battles, this one is unique in how different its three acts are from one another. It makes the film quite re-watchable despite its length. And it all leads up to a finale you have to see to believe. Characters like Iron Man, Black Widow, Hawkeye, and Captain America shine like never before, as the writing for characters is incredibly strong in this movie. I would not say this is the best Avengers film. Its pacing can seem sluggish the first time around and some characters are treated as jokes more than they ought. However, the final act utilizes even its weaknesses to deliver on a satisfying conclusion. The only question left in your mind will be ""Where will Marvel take us next?""",9
Not as good as infinity war,5 May 2019,,6
Most overhyped movie ever,6 September 2019,"Avengers: Endgame is not a good movie. In fact, even when you like the Avengers, there are far better options to watch than this one, for example Infinity War.

Marvel gives it all... blockbuster finale.,18 October 2019,"The marvel delivers a epic finale to avengers series. The years of build up and introduction of new characters definitely pays off . The farwell to some epic characters will definitely hit hard to every loyal marvel fan. The movie had its moments of action, laughter , sadness , togetherness and mindblowing climax. It wont be wrong to say the climax way up higher than the actual expectations. Despite its long run time of 3 hours it stills feels less for such kind of conclusion. The movie had its share of flaws but that does not lets you feel bored even for second. There are movies which are applauded for its story and peformances in the very highly recoginzed festivals around the globe unlike them this movie is itself a festival filled with memorable characters from the marvel cinematic universe. They are the characters who have such an impact that they will remain in the hearts of people for generations to come. This movie belongs to more of scifi or fantasy genre which are far from reality but the presentation of its imagination is delivered in such a way that you get sucked into its virtual universe. There are many series , sequels or combined universe movies who have actually failed to live up to its previous installment. Unlike them marvel universe continues to get bigger better and blockbuster with every passing follow ups. This movie is highly entertaining and enchancting equally to the fans as well as beginners. It definitely deserves a perfect score as it does its best in its own genre and movies as such will be not played be on screen every year. It might not be a masterpiece looking through a critical view but its more of a memory for a marvel fan .",9

"Fun movie, but nothing special",2 May 2019,,7
Skip the first 2 hours,2 August 2019,"There's absolutely no pay off to be had plot wise here. Nothing to see here people. Fast forward through to the last hour and you're good. You will have missed nothing.

This movie was either way too long or just nowhere near long enough. This was supposed to be a part II of conclusion that wraps up an entire universe of characters spanning 20 movies and they couldn't be arsed to give us a third act?

Unfortunately, they titled the movie Avengers: Endgame, and making a sequel to that would be nearly as bad as having a movie titled Rambo: First Blood Part II. What would they have called a third movie? Avengers: The Really Real End Time, Place, Realm. (No, we honestly mean it this time.)

Sadly, the first hour or so of the movie is Ant Man trying to save a tacked on, marketing driven first act that pays off in no way. Meanwhile, also tied to marketing, some major plot holes and omissions were completely egregious.

A large portion of the principle photography for this movie was done alongside side Infinity Wars itself, which would've made sense if they'd had a coherent story line by then.

Leave it to the screenwriters, they'll make something of it. Leave it to the editors, they'll fix it in post. Well, somebody forgot to fix it. And it wasn't me. Fortunately, marketing fixes everything.

Let's face it, there are two kinds of people in this world: those who for a final movie who are just going to love it no matter what, those who view the movie with the same critical eye they would the others, and those who decide that there can only be two types of people.

Why are there always two kinds of people? Look at Loki! Now that's an interesting character. He can be good; he can be bad. He's fiendish and lovable. He's a hero and a villain and an anti-hero and-still, somehow-human, god, and ice thing.

Honestly, Infinity Wars couldn't have come at a worse time. It was originally a much larger unification of Marvel heroes and villains, and now that Disney owns all of the other Marvel Universe crap, that movie could've been the Infinity Wars, with a plot that started to wrap up before the last movie.

Ah well, maybe in 20 years they'll redo the whole thing again with the X-Men and Silver Surfer in it (take or leave the Fan-4. This is super likely.

I heard Spider Man: Far From Home was really really good, but I have no desire to see it. Why? Because it sounds to me like Spider Man visits France for Holiday and Meets some Good Guys and some Bad Guys and forces you to watch the credits so you can see 30 seconds that tease you into watching the next movie that's just going to do the same thing.",3

This was the first time ever in the franchise that they show us the capability of the actors they hired (except for Chris Hemsworth and Tom Holland of course as they have been pretty much one-note. Well, it might be because of the script. They can still prove their ability in many other movies in the future).

Then the action part came in. The central theme of the Avengers franchise. The time traveling was intriguing and everything, but seriously the end was a mess. That scene with force-feminism was ""cringy"" to its best. The death of the character(s) also felt forced and unnecessary.",6

Disappointing movie,4 May 2019,"I thought that Endgame will blow me away, I was wrong. Infinity Ward was an amazing movie, it got 10 out off stars and it just a flawless masterpiece with no errors just pure art. Endgame is full off meaningless crap like the awful humor with cheesy one liners that just destroys the entire movie. It's not funny please stop it I thought while the movie just keep going with these lame and embarrassing jokes that just bored and got me mad at the movie to the point that I wanted it to end but it never did. Another bad thing is that Endgame is so predictable that its just a joke, you don't even have to watch the movie to know how it ends. But the movie did entertain me and it really got tearing up scenes that left me emotional and great character ark, acting and action scenes, but the problem is that there isn't enough of these elements to save the movie, and what's left is a big letdown.

Simply a masterpiece,26 May 2019,"The start of Avengers Endgame leaves every single spectator cold and sympathized locating them in a world after-the-snap where the emptiness that left those who have left and the pain of those who are still, have been present during five long years. Then, The Avengers discover a very risky posibility for bringing everybody back, but our heroes will try it ""Whatever it takes"". Followed by this discovery, Marvel transports us towards a ride through several of the events that ocurred in its cinematographic universe to gather again the infinity gems paying tribute to more than 10 years of films. After this trip that brings with it a very hight cost, we find ourselves with a spectacular and emotive third act full of an overwhelming fan-service that will never be forgotten by its fans, closing masterfully and uniquely the Infinity Saga. The movie came with very high expectations and managed not only to accomplish all of them, but to avercome more than enough them, and Marvel gives fans everything they have dreamed about. The only thing against this film is that it can never be equealed or overcome, locating it on the cusp of Marvel's cinematographic world and leaving too many hight expectations for later films that, even though, we know we'll love them as they always make us do.",10
"""Endgame"" not only delivers a cathartic experience greater than Infinite Warfare, but it also establishes definitive positions regarding the MCU's destinies",29 March 2020,"Finally, the long-awaited conclusion of a saga that was weaved ingeniously and meticulously for a decade by the House of Ideas, under the command of Kevin Feige. If before the studios practically did not bet on superhero films, ten years ago this reality changed completely when we saw ""Iron Man (2008)"" debut in theaters around the world, beginning a wide, complex and detailed shared universe, which gave life to characters that fans so longed to see transported to the cinema and becoming acquainted with others not so popular even among comic book fans. There were three phases that became known as the ""Infinity Saga"", in which we became intimate with Iron Homme, Captain America, Hulk, Black Widow, Hawkeye, Thor, Ant-Man, Spider-Man, Captain Marvel, Black Panther, Guardians of the Galaxy and Doctor Strange.

Filmed simultaneously with ""Infinite War"", the Russo brothers and screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely continue to tell the story of the previous film. Here, superheroes must deal with the events of the previous film, in which half of the people in the galaxy were wiped out at Thanos' snap, including friends and family of our heroes. Those who are left are still, for more than three weeks, trying to locate Thanos who entered a portal and disappeared, while trying to find a solution to reverse what had happened.

The first fifteen minutes invest in revenge and the consummation of failure: an introduction. The next sequences, which make up a first, more melancholic, yet vigorous act in re-presenting characters and renewing the previous status quo, have an emphasis on the intimate, precisely what drives Ultimato as an experience: a great show on a colossal scale, but that cares about a dance, a feeling, a heart, a family.

""Ultimatum"" gets it right by dedicating more than half its duration to intensify the hopelessness, mourning and disbelief that the characters and the audience were going through together. In that time, he takes the opportunity to strengthen ties between unlikely characters, such as Toby Stark and Nebula, and also to show how old friends, such as Natasha, Rogers and Barton, Tony and Thor and Bruce, led their lives five years after the events of the beginning of the movie. The characters have their own layers, monsters and voids, to add to the project itself, which is a mooring of several narrative arches, the sustenance of a three-hour cathartic work. Especially interesting is Tony's bow, living alongside his great love and his little daughter, being the counterpoint to Barton, who had his life transformed after the loss of his family, becoming a vengeful murderer who eliminates those he does not consider worthy. Meanwhile, Carol Danvers went on to help other planets that also suffered from Thanos' actions.

After the presentation of the current situation of each of the heroes, it is when Scott Lang enters the story, who managed to return from the quantum kingdom, after the post-credits scenes that we had followed in ""Ant Man and the Wasp"". He then explains that the laws of physics and space-time do not apply to the quantum realm, theorizing that they could travel through time through the Pym Particles and the portal. From there, after seeing an old photo of him with Peter Parker, Tony ends the time travel equation and the Avengers, with the exception of Danvers, split into groups to return to the past and retrieve the Infinity Stones and that's when Marvel takes audiences on an unforgettable journey celebrating 11 years of their shared universe, revisiting films like ""The Avengers"", ""Captain America 2: The Winter Soldier"", ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" and even the controversial ""Thor: The Dark World"" .

Banner, Rogers, Lang and Stark return to 2012, during Loki's invasion of New York, to retrieve the Tesseract, Loki's scepter and the Eye of Agamotto. They also end up going to 1970 at the S.H.I.E.L.D. in Lehigh to get another version of the Tesseract, which was being tested by the military and to get more particles from Hank Pym, who had just invented them. Meanwhile, Thor and Rocket return to Asgard in 2013 to extract Jane Foster's Reality Gem. Clint and Natasha return to Vormir in 2014 to retrieve the Soul Gem, while Rhodes and Nebula go to Morag, also in 2014, where Peter Quill is about to steal the Gem of Power. This whole time travel will culminate in the great final battle, after Thanos discovering the heroes' plan, where the destiny of the universe will be at stake again.

The cast reaches the height of their characters' understanding, completing a whole development arc. In addition to the main cast, which is already extremely numerous, there are still several cameos from great actors and actresses who showed up in previous productions. Robert Redford, Michelle Pfeiffer, Michael Douglas, Tilda Swinton, Natalie Portman, William Hurt, are just a few of those names, and some of them literally go silent and leave quietly.

With a million dollar budget of US $ 356 million, the film justifies the use of every penny and obviously will not have any difficulty in recovering and sometimes exceeding the high amount invested. They are effects used for the rejuvenation of characters, the construction of scenarios from different eras and worlds, dozens of intergalactic beings from the most different backgrounds and visual effects of a scale and perfection rarely seen. Not for nothing, ""Ultimatum"" was nominated for an Oscar in the category. Few times have we seen so many characters gathered together, with several actions taking place simultaneously, and everything wonderfully orchestrated by the precise direction of the Russo brothers, who manage to maintain a perfect unity and synchrony. The final battle against Thanos that takes up almost the entire last hour of the three that lasts the film, will be remembered as one of the biggest and most spectacular in the history of cinema. There, we can see the full potential of all the heroes presented by the MCU in these years should be a delight for fans of the universe. Not to mention the emotional and beautifully post-battle scenes that tie up all the last loose ends of the Infinity Saga. The audience is in tears. And it is not a daydream or exaggeration.

The soundtrack by Alan Silvestri, responsible for the famous Avengers theme, composed for the 2012 film, is once again perfect, elevating drama, melancholy and epic action to the tenth power. In the musical part, ""Dear Mr. Fantasy"", by Traffic, ""Supersonic Rocket Ship"", by The Kinks, ""Doom and Gloom"" by the Rolling Stones and ""Hey Lawdy Mama"", by Steppenwolf are some of the songs that are present. The production designer of the always competent Charles Wood and photography by Trent Opaloch, who uses and abuses the darkest filters that give the greatest degree of drama and pessimism that guide much of the feature film are used with mastery.

Throughout the film, the Russo brothers think millimetrically about each scene, sometimes to make the audience cry, sometimes to laugh and sometimes to cheer for the heroes in their battles. As well as the conclusion of the saga ""Harry Potter"", ""Star Wars"" and ""Lord of the Rings"", the great megalomaniac of ""Ultimatum"" will remain in the minds of the moviegoers as one of those epic films that practically everyone has watched. And the end, still holds great surprises, some that envision a future of the Universe, such as those involving Thor and The Guardians of the Galaxy and the passing of Captain America's baton.

""Ultimatum"" works above all expectations: it not only delivers a cathartic experience greater than Infinite Warfare, but it also establishes definitive positions regarding the MCU's destinies. The film proves to have been planned in detail by the studio's creative minds, who know more than anyone else, how to please their audience. Although ""Ultimatum"" seems to be the end of the Infinity Saga, phase 3 will officially end with ""Spider-Man: Far From Home"", which should still have consequences for this film in the life of Peter Parker, especially with the death of someone very close and dear to the hero.",9
Amazing,25 April 2019,Conflict of powerhouses. As good as Infinity Wars.,10
Dont understand the hype.,7 May 2019,The Infinity War was 10 times better. The end game is just way to long and boring,6
Its good. Worth watching. But not the best.,8 April 2024,"Its good. But I liked the way Infinity Wars ended better. Time travel stories are hard to like because anything can happen by just messing with it. And that's what they did. They used time to fix a problem. Now I get it, Time is a thing. Its worth telling stories about. Its just so hard to do well.

Besides that, the story is OK. Classic superhero stuff. Its still a good movie. Certainly for what its worth, its a good finally to everything leading up to this movie. Its nice to see the paths of all the superheros coming together to fight the ultimate evil. Or so we think.

Thanatos is powerful. But hes not Loki powerful...",8

It has its moments,1 May 2019,"First off, 'Endgame' is definitely worth watching. It is hard to overestimate the cinematic achievements demonstrated in the movie. It pays tribute to all the plotlines that had been leading up to this culmination through the years. There are some exceptional and iconic scenes which will surely command admiration of many Marvel fans to come.

There are moments to rejoice, there are moments to cry, there are moments to laugh, there are moments to appreciate the fact that you are a contemporary of the people involved in bringing this whole universe to life and that you can experience all this first-hand.

Judging the film by its own merits, however, is a different story. It felt like the directors wanted to seize this 'last' chance and do homage to so many characters and so many things that in the end we are left with this motley crew of multiple episodes and actions stuffed in one wannabe epic finale.

With all its charge and glory, 'Avengers: Endgame' does not surpass 'Infinity War'. After that masterful fight on Titan, turning a black hole into butterflies bears no comparison to taming... a river.",7
Avengers: Endgame Delivers a Thrilling and Emotional Conclusion to Marvel's Epic Saga,19 June 2024,"""Avengers: Endgame"" is a powerful conclusion to Marvel's Infinity Saga.

It masterfully balances action, nostalgia, and deep emotional moments, especially for characters like Tony Stark and Steve Rogers. The movie revisits iconic moments from previous films, enriching the story and providing fans with a sense of closure. Though the time travel plot can be confusing and some characters are underutilized, the movie's epic scale, emotional resonance, and satisfying character arcs make it a landmark in superhero cinema. The climactic battle is a visual spectacle, bringing together an immense ensemble cast in a thrilling showdown.

I didn't considered myself a big mcu fan until now but after seeing these two movie I am officially by heart a real fan of mcu from now on

FAVOURITE CHARACTERS :: iron man (frankly I didn't get why everyone likes iron man so much but in these two movies seeing his whole character arc come ful circle it just melted my heart) FAVOURITE MOMENT :: I can just name the whole movie seriously every moment especially in their quest to retrieve infinity stones whole final battle was just so good but the final moment has to be the best one ""I AM IRON MAN""",10
Very nice,26 June 2024,"After 11 years and 22 films, the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) reaches a turning point with ""Avengers: Endgame"". This epic finale not only concludes the story set in motion by ""Avengers: Infinity War"" but also wraps up character arcs that began years ago.

The film's structure is surprising: the first hour focuses less on action and more on character development. The original Avengers-Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Black Widow, Hulk, and Hawkeye-take center stage. Their decisions and actions resonate with their entire journey, making this a deeply emotional experience.

Ant-Man and Nebula also play crucial roles, while Thanos remains menacing. Although a few flaws exist, including rushed sequences, the overall impact is sumptuous and exhilarating. The craft, world-building, and devotion to character empathy shine through.

In summary, ""Avengers: Endgame"" is a brilliant MCU finale-a must-see for fans and a testament to the franchise's enduring magic.",10
"Good overall, but with some issues.",11 May 2019,"Great visuals and sound, solid acting and directing.

"The perfect ending to a saga, marvel movies should have stopped here",3 September 2023,"The perfect ending to a series, in my opinion. Wrapped up most character arcs quite nicely, and the fan service was fantastic. Despite being a 3 hour long movie it doesn't feel that long at all, and this movie is a perfect sequel to infinity war and a great culmination of ten years of marvel movies. Marvel movies should have just stopped here, but alas they continued until they got boring and stale and no one cares that much about it anymore. Well, at least I don't. Maybe I've just moved on and grown too old for the superhero genre, but phase 4 was a disaster for marvel movies. It's like they took everything bad about Marvel and these films and put it into multiple shows and movies (with the exception of Spiderman: Far From Home which was quite good, but that was technically Sony and not Disney). Of course I know Disney would never have ended it here since they are a greedy corporation, but, still to me, Marvel movies ended here.",9
"Good, but not good enough!",21 October 2019,"I trully an not exactly sure how i feel about this movie. After the huge surprise that was Infinity War, i genuinely didn't know if they could do something to top that movie. And... they didn't. Don't get me wrong Avengers: Endgame is a very fun movie that tries to be more serious than regular Marvel movies and just like Infinity War tries to balance a lot of different characters. The ending is a great tribute to RDJs iconic Iron Man role and it does feel like the massive conclusion of a cinematic universe that has been building up to this movie for more than 10 years. However it is flawed in many apsects. First and foremost, the movie has too many plotholes and honestly the whole time travel thing makes no sense if you think about it for more than a minute (granted that always happens with time travel but still) (also Tony Stark straight up invents time travel in an evening). Thor became a proper joke in this movie, which is a shame considering he peaked in Infinity War. Yes, it made sense for the narrative but they absolutely ridiculed him. Also i expected a bit more than fat jokes. Speaking of jokes the humour is good in this movie, but a lot of jokes just don't land... at all. As far as other characters are concerned, Black Widow is in the movie just to die and Captain America going in the past to live a normal life was a horrendous choice, and something extremely uncharacteristic of him. The rest of the characters were dealt with preety well, i especially liked what they did with Hulk, since having him be just a smashing machine again would be boring. My biggest complain though is surprisingly the action, which i found supbar ! Especially the final fight was just a massive chi slugfest, which makes sense considering there where so many characters on screen. Also the cgi is surprisingly weak on some points! I personally would have preferred if instead of another huge fight with a billion different characters and useless armies we got a showdown between the original 6 Avengers and Thanos and The Black Order, while the rest were fighting off the generic army. Thanos also felt a bit less threatening than before and also a bit more stupid and a lot more reckless. And the Black Order was barely even used, for some reason. Furthermore, a lot of moments clearly happened just for the sake a fan service, which i didn't like at all. Finally, though i enjoyed the direction of the film, i found the score and cinematography to be good but extremely basic. All in all, Avengers: Endgame serves as a nice conclusion to a massive chapter of a franchise, which however features a plethora of flaws amd ultimately doesn't bring anything new to the table. I'll give this movie a 6.5/10",6
WOW what a movie,2 May 2019,Just wow. This is the 1st time I have watched a movie and everybody clapped at the end of it. It is one of if not the best movie I have ever seen. No wonder it is breaking records. I will go and see it again,10

"A flawed masterpiece, but a masterpiece nevertheless.",14 July 2022,"8.4

(mild spoilers ahead)

Avengers: Endgame is not better than Infinity War. There are a couple problems with it and therefore cannot match it's effortless predecessor. Infinity War is probably my favorite MCU movie. Not only was it able to create a balance of characters similar to Lord of The Rings, but it also entered uncharted territory for a superhero movie - the protagonists lost.

Endgame is focused exclusively on this loss at the cost of an effective first act, which is quite slow to be honest. Not a lot happens and things have to get to speed by the second act. The pacing isn't so bad, either. The second and third acts are very well built and the final battle could also be comparable to the maelstrom battle in Pirates 3 or even some major battles from LOTR.

The 3-hour runtime is also necessary. Most of that time is usually well spent or time thrown away. It depends on what perspective you see it from, but there's no denying that the movie felt more like 2 hours than 3.

In conclusion, Avengers: Endgame is a masterpiece. It does have it's flaws and isn't any better than Infinity War, but it's still really, really good.",

Closure to a great series,6 December 2019,Avengers INFINITY WAR was the best in the series so my expectations were low for the follow up. This movie dealt more with substance than style and is completely different than all the other Avenger movies. Definitely the most emotional movie of the series hence why they called it Endgame. Yes it's long but the characters carry the film much more than the action does. I enjoyed the film and may watch it again sometime. It was very good and delivered a fitting end but not the type of Avenger film you would want to watch again and again. That film belongs to INFINITY WAR.,8

You will laugh, you will cry, and hard-core fans will definitely feel shocked at times. There sure are surprises, that some will love and some will hate. The Russo brothers made sure to change the pace considerably from what we are used to, since this film is about closures and farewells. I'm also fully convinced they did their fanfiction and fanart research to please most viewers with certain outcomes, and ended up presenting us with one fulfilling, tear-jerking three hours long rollercoaster parting gift. So go see this gift, and as we've been told in the trailers, enjoy the ride.",8

After suffering unimaginable losses at the hands of Thanos in Avengers: Infinity War, Tony Stark is lost in space with Nebula with only short time left to live. When they are rescued and brought back to earth by Captain Marvel, the remaining Avengers decide to hunt Thanos to try to undo what's been done. When they find Thanos and discover the infinity stones are destroyed, the Avengers have no choice, but to accept their losses and move on. After some time has passed and a quantum trapped Ant-Man emerges to offer the Avengers a chance to undo what's been done, the Avengers assemble for what could be the final time if not successful to undo Thanos's reign of terror on the universe no matter what it takes. So first off, this film absolutely lived up to the hype and expectations fans were expecting, giving us a superhero film unlike no other. Robert Downey Jr as Iron Man gives probably my favorite performance ever as the character in this film that shows what it truly means to be Iron Man. Also, Chris Evan's Captain America in this movie I felt was also the best version we have seen of the character. Chris Hemsworth's Thor was great, although I felt some of the writing choices for his character wasn't as great as Infinity War, but overall he was good. Mark Ruffalo's Bruce Banner/Hulk brings us a new side of the character we haven't seen until now. Scarlett Johansson's Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow is stunning as always. Jeremy Renner's Clint Barton/Hawkeye/Ronin is great as well and is one of the standout characters of the entire film. Lastly Josh Brolin's Thanos was terrific as well, although he wasn't in it nearly as much as Infinity War, they still did a great job with his character. The visual effects, to the stunt choreography, and the set pieces for this film were unlike anything that's been done in films before and was pulled off masterfully. Overall, Avengers: Endgame is a great conclusion to the infinity saga that brings us great character arcs, amazing action sequences, dazzling visual effects, a magnificent story, and also looks forward to what lies ahead for the future of the MCU. Rating 10/10.",10
A true love letter for the real fans,27 April 2019,"Either bitter DC fans or people with short attention spans seem to be dissing this magnificent film. In order to get the most from Endgame it really does require you to have seen most of the previous MCU films. It's emotional payoff is probably the most rewarding of any film I have ever seen. It's funny, it's sad, it's exciting at the same time. It's not perfect, no film is. Perfection doesn't exist. It's an unattainable construct. However I truly feel it is the best possible version of the final chapter of the MCU any fan could have asked for. Nuff said.",9
A fitting conclusion to a marvelous saga,26 June 2024,"""Avengers: Endgame"" serves as an epic conclusion to over a decade of Marvel Cinematic Universe storytelling, delivering a satisfying blend of action, emotion, and spectacle. Directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, the film brings together a vast ensemble cast, including Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, and Chris Hemsworth, who each deliver powerful performances in their respective roles.

The film picks up after the devastating events of ""Infinity War,"" where the Avengers are left grappling with their greatest defeat. ""Endgame"" masterfully balances a somber tone with moments of humor and hope as the remaining heroes devise a plan to undo the damage caused by Thanos. The plot is intricate, weaving together various storylines and character arcs, resulting in a cohesive and engaging narrative.

Visually, ""Endgame"" is stunning, with impressive special effects and breathtaking action sequences. The final battle is particularly memorable, showcasing the scale and ambition of the film. The emotional stakes are high, and the film does not shy away from delivering poignant moments that resonate deeply with the audience.

Overall, ""Avengers: Endgame"" is a triumphant and fitting finale to the Infinity Saga. It honors the legacy of its characters while providing closure and setting the stage for the future of the MCU. It's a must-watch for any Marvel fan, offering a thrilling and heartfelt conclusion to an extraordinary journey.",8
Entertaining,26 April 2019,Not really expected that kinda of ending as it's superhero movie always gets good at end this doesn't; story and drama was good ; time traveling concept explained is confusing; little more action scenes was expected ; Already missing the lost heroes.,8
Worth to watch if you like a series of Marvel,6 May 2019,"It is made with great CG and it does not make me bored even though it runs for three hours. However, it is better to watch all of marvel films. I did not do it so I could not get some point.",8
"Uneven, strained, somewhat pandering but heartfelt",9 May 2019,"Pandering to the politics of the day created one shot during the epic battle of ALL of the female characters that this female found trite and patronizing. 2 or more other major plot decisions are also a betrayal of the fandom by surrendering to the tyranny of identity politics. Uneven and contradictory handling of the characters and plot decisions created a long list of plot holes and distractions .... compare Spiderman's friend and Ant Man's daughter. There are touching and heartfelt moments ... happy and sad tears shed. Sadly, those are diminished by the distractions of the plot issues. The 7 rating was a nod to the efforts of the players, despite the machinations of the script.",7
A Satisfying Conclusion for MCU Phase 3,2 May 2024,"In a fitting culmination to Phase 3 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), Avengers: Endgame delivers what fans have come to expect from the franchise: a spectacle of epic proportions wrapped in a familiar superhero narrative. Directed by the Russo brothers, the film ties up numerous loose ends while providing a hearty dose of entertainment.

Picking up from the aftermath of Avengers: Infinity War, where Thanos's snap left half of all life in the universe obliterated, Endgame delves into the emotional turmoil that ensues. From Tony Stark's isolation in space to the vengeful determination of the remaining heroes, the film doesn't shy away from exploring the human side of its superhuman characters.

The plot hinges on a time-travel element, an ambitious twist that allows for a nostalgic revisiting of key moments in MCU history. While this approach leads to some enjoyable and even humorous scenes, it also risks feeling like a prolonged exercise in fan service. The final confrontation, while visually striking, occasionally struggles with a sense of predictability as it's woven together.

As the heroes band together for their final stand, the film's true strength lies in its ensemble cast. Characters like Captain America and Black Widow are given moments to shine, offering resolutions to arcs that have spanned multiple movies. While the film's lengthy runtime accommodates these character beats, there are instances where pacing becomes a concern, leading to stretches that feel a tad indulgent.

Endgame excels in its technical aspects. The visuals are a treat for the eyes, as expected from a film of this magnitude. The CGI-driven battles are a delight for action aficionados, showcasing the superpowers and teamwork that have become the trademark of the MCU. Yet, it's the emotional weight that these battles carry that ultimately resonates with audiences.

In terms of closure for Phase 3, Avengers: Endgame mostly delivers. It ties up storylines and arcs that have been developed over a decade, providing a sense of conclusion and catharsis. The film succeeds in offering a sense of finality, even though there are moments where narrative convenience and familiarity override genuine surprise. It's an entertaining ride with moments of emotional resonance, and while it occasionally feels trapped by its own legacy and anticipation, it undeniably provides a satisfying conclusion to Phase 3.",8
Marvel killed their own logic... Full with mistakes,7 August 2019,,7
Very Long.,5 February 2021,Too long for bad plot. The movie is 3 t 1 min use your time better!,2
Well-produced for a casual TV movie,28 July 2019,"The storytelling is obviously inspired by unserious ""fun"" episodes or specials for TV, with its lack of real drama or any kind of directorial sophistication, just simple problem solving and casual action. Based on that, I can understand why people give this movie such a crazy-good rating. Its production values are truly monumental, or rather, the computing power is truly impressive, and the studio did good work.

But being what it is, I still can't rate it higher than average.",

The mother of all superhero movies,26 April 2019,"If you thought Marvel couldn't top themselves after Infinity War, you're in for a huge surprise. And best of all, even if you read tons of rave spoil-free reviews (like I did before going in) you will *still* be amazed.

Everything in this movie works: The directing, the script, the editing, the music, the acting, everything.

Everyone will enjoy it, and fans will love it.",10
Solid Round 2 after Infinity War,26 April 2019,"Just to give you some advice anyone who is thinking about seeing this film they need to watch the past Avenger films from the start.

The storyline might be a little bit of getting used to but overall it is still a great plot for a Avengers film. After the end of Infinity War it was good to see how the characters had moved on and how the world is picking up the pieces of what had happened. When the sh*t goes down in terms of the action it really is on par and in some aspects beats Infinity War in terms of the diversity and the use of what each character is shown to do.

Overall a solid Avengers Film",10

Very normal,9 July 2019,"I am not a Marvel fans so I hadn't seen many marvel movies so far . I think a good movie especially such magnitude like avenger 4 should let most people can understand content even I didn't see other marvel movies before.

What do you think about this film?

Review menu icon Seth The Gamer a month ago Phenomenally entertaining and a masterpiece!!! The Russo brothers nailed it again!!! I'm so grateful they're directing these movies. It makes them so much better and everything is so well thought out. Love it!! It's so on-point. Has everything drama, suspense, some funny comedy moments, full of adventure, mystery, and impressive action sequences I've ever seen. It's the most best superhero movie I've ever seen in my life. The acting was superb and convincing. Very well directed, written and lucid with a fantastic plot. An amazing emotional experience not only for the fans, but for everyone that has seen all the Marvel movies accumulated all together with our most favorite iconic characters we love. What an incredible journey we've come so far to conclude 22 Marvel films. I had a great time watching it and does not disappoint. Lots of great twists and turns throughout the whole movie. Has to deal with tragedy, catastrophe, and dealing with consequences of our actions and to overcome our struggles in life. There's a lot of heart warming moments that will make you melt. It will have you off the edge of your seat, your eyes glued to the screen, unexpected surprises and moments, and emotional sad events that you don't want to miss. The Avengers does whatever it takes in this epic bold finale that will live on their legacy within our hearts. Perfection. Amazing movie!!! I definitely recommend to watch this with your whole family and friends, you won't regret it. 10/10. I love this movie!!!",
Very good but not as good as Infinity War,27 April 2019,,8
An emotional rollercoaster of epic proportions!!,22 May 2019,"I have seen this movie about 6 times (including opening night) and I love it as much as the first time! I have just been scrolling through reviews and could not believe some of the negative reviews on here! It has been called boring and some posters here have said the positive reviews have come from ""sponsors"". No, the positive reviews here came from a devoted fan base that have watched 22 movies for over a decade and are emotionally connected to the characters and the storyline! This movie IS the best ""fan service"" to ever be created! I really do suggest you do watch this movie if you are a fan of the MCU and not listen to these pretentious ""critics"" who only like art house indie films and hate on everything made by a studio! If you are a fan of the MCU and have followed along the span of 22 movies and love the characters then this movie will run you through the gamut of emotions! I have never seen a more interactive audience in my life. Laughs and cheers at all the right moments and dead silence in the emotional ones. Not a dry eye in the crowd when the lights came on and no one was embarrased because everyone was on the same journey whether you were 7 or 57. My opinion may be biased because I LOVE these movies but most posters on here are down right cynical and will try to find something wrong with anything! I only post positive reviews because even if I don't like something it doesn't mean that someone can't like it and I don't want my opinion to sway their curiosity. Life is subjective in general but I try and only focus on the positive!",10
Avengers: Endgame - A Spectacular and Emotional MCU Finale,21 May 2024,"Avengers: Endgame masterfully concludes a decade-long cinematic saga, delivering an emotional and action-packed finale that will satisfy Marvel fans. The film skillfully balances humour and pathos, offering poignant character moments alongside spectacular set pieces.

Directors Anthony and Joe Russo deftly handle a vast ensemble cast, ensuring each hero has their moment to shine. The time travel plot, while complex, is well-executed and serves the narrative effectively.

Visually stunning and emotionally resonant, Endgame is a triumph. It's a fitting tribute to the beloved characters who have captured our hearts over the years, and a testament to the power of cinematic storytelling. While perhaps overly indulgent for some, Endgame is a must-see for fans of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.",10
Everything you need!,22 May 2019,This movie hits all the right moves and I couldn't have been happier with how they concluded this Marvel chapter.,10
Amazing,25 April 2023,"Avengers: Endgame is an action-packed and heartwarming conclusion to the Marvel Cinematic Universe's Infinity Saga. The movie is a rollercoaster ride of emotions that will keep audiences at the edge of their seats from start to finish.

The film features an all-star cast, including Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, and more, who all deliver powerful performances that will leave viewers on the brink of tears. The action sequences are some of the best in the MCU, with breathtaking special effects and epic battles that will leave audiences cheering.

Despite the film's intense action, it also manages to be heartwarming and filled with moments of humor and camaraderie between the characters. Watching the Avengers come together to fight for what they believe in is truly inspiring, and the film's message of hope and unity is one that resonates deeply with audiences.

However, be warned, the film's ending is a sad one that will leave many viewers feeling emotional. While it may not be the ending that fans were hoping for, it is a fitting conclusion to the Infinity Saga and a testament to the incredible storytelling that has made the MCU so beloved.

Overall, Avengers: Endgame is a must-see for any fan of the MCU or superhero movies in general. It's an epic conclusion to an incredible journey that will leave viewers feeling satisfied, but also a little bit sad that it's all over.",9
Good but not great.,15 May 2019,Honestly I found the first two hours to be pretty boring. A lot of it seemed unnecessary and drawn out to me but the final hour definitely picked up and was amazing. I was close to giving this a 7 but the end definitely had me emotional which never happens to me so clearly it had an effect on me! Great performances by RDJ and Chris Evans. Not so great performance by Scarlett Johansson though. Everyone else was good although Thor's issues were kind of too much after a while.,8
A Good Movie but,6 May 2019,,6
Nearly perfect,20 November 2019,"As a big fan of Marvel, end game cannot be better to me. However, the greater end game is, the more worry I have for future Marvel movies without Iron Man and Cap",9
"Good, not great.",27 April 2019,"I think my problem with this movie is there was SO MUCH STORY to cover that much of the screen time is devoted to exposition and tying up loose ends- too much of the movie feels more like an obligation than an adventure.

My other complaint is that there were some fantastic ideas presented in the film that don't quite play out to their potential. It still get points for introducing the ideas at all, but ultimately they left me a touch disappointed.

But honestly, I can't imagine how they could've done things any differently (just like Dr. Strange said! There was only one way for this to end!).

I won't ruin the ending, but I'll just say it's clear that ACT 3 is where the filmmakers put all of their attention, and it pays off VERY well.

I think Infinity War is a far superior movie in terms of writing, editing, and overall fun, but this movie will still satisfy fans.

Bitter sweet see the end of a 10 year era of movie-making, but it was great to be along for the ride.",7
So boring and predictable movie,29 April 2019,Standard story with happy end with a lot of tearful and stupid dialogs. A battle till about 10-15 mins from 3 hours.,3
Good but hulk has been ruined,1 May 2019,,
"""Avengers: Endgame: A Symphony of Heroic Heart and Spectacle""",8 May 2024,"""Avengers: Endgame"" is a film that arrives with the weight of a culminating symphony, the final movement in a grand saga of heroes, villains, and the humanity they embody. It is a cinematic tapestry woven from threads of joy, sorrow, and the rich hues of sacrifice and perseverance.

The film, directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, is a testament to the narrative power that can be achieved when stories are told with a genuine affection for the characters and their journeys. The Russos have managed to balance the scales of spectacle and intimacy with the precision of a master watchmaker. The action sequences are crafted with an eye for grandeur, yet they never lose sight of the emotional stakes at their core. Each punch and blast resonates not just through the theater but through the hearts of the audience, who have spent over a decade with these characters.

The ensemble cast, a veritable pantheon of talent, brings a depth of performance that is rare in such blockbuster fare. Robert Downey Jr.'s Tony Stark is the soul of the film, delivering a performance that is both charismatic and hauntingly vulnerable. Chris Evans' Captain America stands as the moral compass, unwavering and resolute. Meanwhile, Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow and Jeremy Renner's Hawkeye bring a poignant humanity to their roles, reminding us that beneath the superpowers and spectacle, these are individuals with hearts and souls.

The narrative itself is a complex weave of time travel and alternate realities, a bold choice that pays off by allowing for moments of reflection and character growth that are as surprising as they are satisfying. The script, penned by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, is a deft blend of humor, heartache, and heroism, with dialogue that crackles with energy and wit.

The ambition of its storytelling sometimes overshadows its coherence, leaving the audience to grapple with convoluted plot points that can detract from the overall experience. The pacing, too, occasionally falters, with the film's three-hour runtime feeling its length in places where the narrative indulges in one too many detours.

The reliance on the audience's foreknowledge of the preceding films can be a double-edged sword. For the devoted, it is a richly rewarding experience, but for the uninitiated, it can be an impenetrable fortress of references and assumed emotional investments.

""Avengers: Endgame"" stands as a monument to the power of storytelling and the resonance of myth. It is a film that not only entertains but also reflects the times we live in, with themes of loss, hope, and the enduring belief that individuals can make a difference. It is a fitting capstone to a saga that has defined a generation of cinema, and while it may stumble in moments, it soars in far more, leaving us with a sense of wonder and a satisfaction that is as rare as it is deserved.",8
A good ending for the avengers franchise,3 May 2019,"This one is good but some characters are getting way too little attention. Like the other movies this one is a ""cinema movie"".",8
Great film but,3 May 2019,,8
Good film,25 May 2019,,9
overall good movie,1 January 2020,"I was just wondering if anyone else thought that there are inconsistencies with the size of Hulk. Sometimes he seems a lot bigger than other times. Not just in this movie, but in all of them.",8
He's Still our Captain,11 July 2019,"We have had a ten-year relationship with the MCU. It started with IRON MAN, moved on to Captain America, inserted young Spider-Man and even gave us royalty in Black Panther. So here we are ten years later ready to sit another three hours with our favorite superheroes. After speculating and scouring the internet for the clues the day has finally come. Avengers Endgame is here.

The question is, was it worth it? A resounding yes. This movie was thoughtful, and action-packed at the same time.

It opens with our remaining Avengers trying to resolute what just happened. One would think that the Russo Brothers would give us a movie filled with Sadness and Revenge, but that's not the case here. Thor still gives us strength and humor. Cap gives us optimism and Tony aka Iron Man finally figures out what's important to him. Dr. Banner/Hulk is still a mystery however Black Widow gives us a little vulnerability.

Where does Captain Marvel fit, and will they ever find the other Avengers all those questions get answered?

Some things to be aware of, the first half of the movie takes a slower pace. It allows the surviving Avengers to grieve. Also, the reintroduction of Ant-Man and Arrow are handled smoothly.

This movie is an emotional rollercoaster at times. This movie is for us die-hard Marvel fans. The ones that grew up reading the comic books and binged watched all the other films in the MCU getting ready for this,

We're going to say goodbye to some favorites but not before we are treated to epic battles and friendships are mended.

Avengers, Endgame is everything we want from Marvel and more. One last Cameo from Stan Lee and one last time our Avengers face down evil. The three hours are going to fly by and leave us a little sad, but Endgame gives us a fitting ending.

Scale: I give this movie a nine. Good things do come to those that wait.

Diversity: It gets 8.5 superheroes do all come in different shapes and color.",8
"It was good, but...",5 May 2019,,7
Great Finale,15 April 2023,"""Avengers: Endgame"" is probably the biggest cinematic event of the twenty-first century. It's hard to describe what it was like seeing this movie in the first few weeks when it came out, people were going nuts over this. When it came out, I personally didn't like it as much as ""Infinity War"", but upon rewatching, I actually like it better and I personally think it's one of the best Marvel films.

First off, the story goes in a completely different direction than I had thought it was going to go. By the half hour mark, we're introduced to a really fun time travel plot. Then it concludes with an epic final battle. Personally, I thought that the ending was really nice and it was a good sendoff to the first generation of MCU heroes. In hindsight, knowing where the series has gone in the past few years since this movie, I kind of wish that it had just ended here and there weren't movies like ""Black Widow"" and ""Multiverse of Madness"" that changed a lot of these characters.

Although I said that I liked the final battle, I will also say that it came off a little bit rushed. Like it's basically the exact same ending battle that we got in the previous movie.

Definitely watch this, if you're one of the five people that hasn't already. Definitely one of the best superhero movies of all time, a huge entertainment spectacle with great special effects and a heroic triumph.",9
Entertaining but rushed.,19 June 2020,"The entire movie, as entertaining as it is, seems as though everyone involved was ready to be done with it all.

The plot is unfulfilling. The inclusion of several characters seems forced.

The action is satisfying, and everyone will find someone to cheer for.

We're meant at the end, to weep for the grand conclusion. I weep for what could have been.",7
Boring abd pales in comparison to Infinity war,26 April 2019,I was bored throughout this movie. 1. Nothing really happens for most of the movie and there are so many unnecessary long scenes. 2.There is one really good fight/ action sequence. 3. THEY DID THOR SO WRONG. I watched Infinity war the night before and I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. With endgame I was looking at my phone the whole time hoping something would happen.,2
"Did entertain, not wow though",3 May 2019,,
Endgame,18 July 2019,The end of an era. It was a good movie but probably infinity war was better.,8
Dont act like it's cool to hate it because everyone loved it,28 April 2019,"Sometimes I feel like some IMDb trolls purposefully downvote something to keep overrated movies at the top of the all time list. I don't remember a movie matching and exceeding THIS big of hype. It's a great ending to a crapload of marvel movies. Makes you want to go back and watch all of them again. Plus when can you remember the last time you actually weren't sure if a character was going to die or if the good guys were going to win. If you didn't have at least a tad of doubt, you're in denial. Infinity War was a tiny bit better imo but they are both epic! Every movie is going to have plot holes if you sit there and pick it apart forever. Guaranteed you could claim plot holes in q documentary if you tried (these days i wouldnt doubt some idiot has). Good for you, you are so smart! No fooling you! Enjoy the entertainment and eat some popcorn. Let yourself enjoy life and dont worry about wanting to be pissed off/unimpressed all the time. My goodness. 10/10",10

This movie was sooo crazyy,22 May 2019,,10
This proves the longstanding effect of emotional investment in movies,26 April 2019,"I would like to assure all readers that I will not be including any spoilers from Avengers: Endgame. This film, according to me, is the finest comic book adaptation I have seen in the form of a movie. This humanised so many heroes that we are used to seeing fight Godly beings. Regardless of the long 182 minutes runtime, the pacing of this film is impeccable. Never does this film seem convoluted or exhaustingly long. However, a note for the non-Marvel viewers contemplating watching this film - this may be difficult to follow if you have not seen most of the previous films, at least the sequences in the middle of the film. For the fans, this really does pay off the 10 years of commitment you have exhibited and shown. Having seen the events of 21 films coalesce here is a privilege for me. I loved every moment and part of the film to the core.",9
Goosebumps.,25 April 2019,"Absolutely loved everything about this movie. It gave me everything I hoped for, and much more. After 11 years and 22 movies, this is the finale where everything comes together. Three hours is a long sit, but I would gladly sacrifice my ass to watch a bit longer. God bless you Stan Lee. Eat that DC.",10

Mixed feelings,30 April 2019,"The first half felt sappy and chatty. I found myself fighting the Zzzz in this first half. But the second half felt like a time travel thriller (a la mission impossible team). The climax with the actual battle was good, like epic battles we have seen before from the Marvel Universe. I was disappointed that there wasn't an end scene. I have grown accustomed to expect an end scene leading up to a new Marvel movie so I felt jipped watching the ending credits and not seeing an end scene. I think it's like a 6 3/4 out of 10 and I rounded it up to 7/10",7

Super Good Film,6 April 2024,,
good movie but less action scenes,30 April 2019,This is a good movie but its not a typical marvel movie. i mean aren't you a fan of marvel because of all those crazy action sequences? but this movie have it less. this is more like a ending to the previous movies so dont except it to be as equal as infinity war interms of action but this movie have a lot of emotional scenes which you can get attached if you are marvel fan but if you are not then the first 2hours wont make much sense to you. as a marvel fan i can rate this movie 10/10 i even watched it two times but as a general audience this movie goes to either 7 or 8.,8
Stark Naked,28 April 2019,"Well, I never thought I would be in a movie theatre where men and woman were crying in a superhero movie, but it happened. Robert Downey gave his best performance to date imho. Cheering, laughing, crying, and a good old fashioned round of applause at the end, says it all. A very good movie, I scored 8.5. I would definitely go and see it again, after I did I might give it a 9. Fitting finale to a fantastic franchise",8
A nerd fantasy,21 November 2019,"Avengers Endgame delivers something that is beyond imagination, something is fantasy of every comic book nerd or a cinephile.

Let's think objectively here.,15 September 2019,,9
Entertaining & Worth Watching But Sadly Overhyped,30 April 2019,"This is going to be unpopular opinion but after reading many of these reviews, it may not become unpopular. I will do the best I can to keep this spoiler free. There are obvious plot holes that will drive many MCU & non MCU fans nuts. Also, the movie starts off very slow and never really takes off for 2 hours. While there were emotional scenes & good actions scenes near & in the end of the film, it doesn't fully deliver its full potential throughout. Some of the superheroes barely get any screen time as well & you'll see why many people complain about Thor's obnoxious behavior. While it may to tempting to bash this movie to bits and give it a 5, I respect the ideas, acting, music, CGI, & work that was put into this. It definitely wasn't half a**ed but also wasn't completely solid either. Overall, you will most definitely be entertained and leave the theater with a smile on your face most likely but soon realize Infinity War is sooooo much better & more memorable due to its comedy, action, CGI, equal use of superheroes, plot, & the memorable Thanos. However, this movie didn't irritate me enough for me to hate on it. If you have kids tho, this movie will be a blast for them as my theater had kids hollering & emotional. 7/10 for my rating.",7

Flawed yet satisfying,11 May 2019,"While the film isn't perfect I couldn't help but pump my fist and squirm in my chair at every moment. It's so exhilarating and exciting. I do agree that the time travel in the film does not obey its own rules at all, it still supplies the viewer with tons of fan service that they will remember for years to come. I left the movie satisfied with what I saw, a perfect finale to many characters story's.",7
Over rated and over long.,29 April 2019,This movie was an hour and a half too long! The first half of the movie was slow and uninteresting. It did improve as it went along but was unnecessarily long and carried on with so much non sense that was not essential to the plot. Another example of an over hyped film doing well at the box office because of a big budget and star power. It is marginally better than the last Avengers movie but still mediocrity at its best.,1
Wow,10 September 2023,"""Avengers: Endgame"" is an epic culmination of over a decade of Marvel Cinematic Universe storytelling. Released in 2019, it brought an end to the Infinity Saga and left a lasting impact on both fans and the film industry.

Great pPotential Wasted by Weak Writing,24 April 2019,"Well, this has been what we all have been waiting for quite some time now. 10 years in making, characters we grew find of and vast and complex storylines. They all have ended up to this movie. I wanted to watch this movie on the opening night and couldn't wait to get in. As someone who has been following the Marvel universe fairly thoroughly and watched almost all of the movies leading to this one multiple times, to be honest, I wasn't blown away. The problem for me was that while I was enjoying the movie, I couldn't help but to realize this is going to be THE last one, so all of a sudden I wasn't that impress with the way many scenes were being handled. Especially, when you compare it to some of the other Marvel movies which were fantastic. If I were to single out one problem, it would be poor writing. I don't know whether they had time issue or spmething else but the material is so weak and the dialogues are so forgettable and superficial that were robbing the beauty out of the fantastic visual effects and sound effects and acceptable directing and casting. There were numerous occasions I was literally yearning for a killer line by the characters to hit me write in the heart and lingers with me for the rest of my life but the magic was far far from there. It was weird in a sense that they have already had many splendid writings in the Marvel movies to this date but why the most important chapter (the finale) should be like this is truly astonishing. All in all, it is not a bad movie in any ways but for the folks who have been following the Marvel movies seriously or semi-seriously, you will be a little disappointed that why this potential has been wasted in this way.",9

What a celebration!,28 April 2019,"*Spoiler free review*

What can I say, I am just another die hard Marvel studios fan that happened to literally cry while watching the saga end..

When Iron man first came out back in 2008 my brother told me there is this new super hero movie where the guy wears a robocop like suit to fight bad guys. Growing up hearing mostly names like superman, batman n spiderman I really didnt care about Ironman. To me it was just another movie that wouldn't even get past the first installment.

Little did I knew it would leave such a great impact on me and my feelings. So strong enough to keep me at the edge on my seat and fill my heart with soo many emotions that I never thought I had for all my favorite characters.

If you are a Marvel fan like me, I bet you really don't need to depend on reviews like these. Because there is nothing that can stop you from watching the movie, if anything you could simply read reviews to feel excited and joyful to see soo many crazy fans like yours who have grown with all our superheroes together share their emotions and experiences.

I wanna write so much, but at the same time I wanna save your time so you could go and watch this movie already. Just like me I am sure you have plenty of favorites that you love onscreen, and I can guarantee you that this movie will not only make it more nostalgic but also give you a permanent reason to love them for what they are and what they stood for, and how they ended their epic journey, forever in your heart.

After all, we are meant to lose people we love, how else would we know how important they are to us?

What a movie, what a journey, what a conclusion, what an epic battle, what a fun ride, what an emotional roller coaster, what a heartbreaking moment(s), what an amazing performance, what a timing, what a dialogue delivery, what a beautiful celebration!",10

The scenes that were meant to be emotional were executed poorly, didnt make me feel anything other than boredom. Seems all the 10 star ratings are just from marvel fans! Face it guys, it is a bad film. The previous avengers was 1000x better. The whole length of infinity war was about them defeating thanos, in this film it took them 20 minutes.",2
An emotional and satisfying finale,26 April 2019,"""Part of the journey is the end"" - Tony Stark. I was not ready for the end.

Avengers:Endgame 2019,14 June 2024,"**Avengers: Endgame (2019) - A Culmination of a Cinematic Journey**

The Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) reached an apex with ""Avengers: Endgame,"" a film that not only serves as a sequel to the cataclysmic ""Avengers: Infinity War"" but also as the conclusion of a saga that has spanned over a decade and 22 films. Directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, ""Endgame"" is a monumental achievement in modern filmmaking, balancing a sprawling ensemble cast, intricate plotlines, and emotional depth, all while delivering the high-octane action fans expect.

Picking up in the aftermath of Thanos' snap, which wiped out half of all life in the universe, ""Endgame"" explores the grief and determination of the surviving Avengers. The world is in ruins, and the heroes are left grappling with their failure and loss. This sense of despair is palpable, setting a somber tone that contrasts sharply with the vibrant, often lighthearted nature of earlier MCU entries. The film does not shy away from showing the psychological scars left on its characters, from Tony Stark's (Robert Downey Jr.) retreat into domestic life and Captain America's (Chris Evans) struggle to lead a support group, to Thor's (Chris Hemsworth) descent into depression and self-loathing.

The plot kicks into high gear when Scott Lang (Paul Rudd), also known as Ant-Man, escapes from the quantum realm and presents the possibility of time travel as a means to undo Thanos' snap. This sets the stage for a heist-like adventure that sees the Avengers traveling to various points in their past, revisiting key moments from previous films. This clever narrative device allows for a rich exploration of the series' history, providing fans with nostalgic callbacks and a deeper understanding of the characters' journeys.

One of the film's greatest strengths lies in its ability to juggle its extensive cast, giving each character meaningful moments and arcs. The original six Avengers-Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner)-are given particular focus, honoring their contributions to the franchise. Black Widow and Hawkeye's mission to retrieve the Soul Stone is a poignant highlight, showcasing the deep bond between the two characters and culminating in a heartbreaking sacrifice.

The final act of ""Endgame"" is nothing short of spectacular. The climactic battle against Thanos is a visual and emotional tour de force, featuring the largest assembly of superheroes ever seen on screen. The return of the dusted heroes through Doctor Strange's (Benedict Cumberbatch) portals is a triumphant moment that ignites the audience's excitement. Every character gets their moment to shine, and the action choreography is both exhilarating and coherent, avoiding the pitfalls of chaotic editing that plague many blockbuster finales.

Yet, it is the smaller, quieter moments that truly elevate ""Endgame."" Tony Stark's reconciliation with his father during the time heist, Thor's emotional encounter with his mother, and Steve Rogers' decision to finally live a life for himself are all scenes that resonate deeply, providing a satisfying emotional payoff. The film's conclusion, which sees Captain America passing his shield to Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie) and Iron Man's ultimate sacrifice to save the universe, are powerful, defining moments that underscore the themes of legacy and heroism.

""Avengers: Endgame"" is not without its flaws. The time travel mechanics, while fun, can be convoluted and require a suspension of disbelief. Some fans may also feel that certain characters, like Captain Marvel (Brie Larson), were underutilized given the build-up to their introductions. However, these are minor quibbles in the context of the film's overarching success.

In conclusion, ""Avengers: Endgame"" is a cinematic triumph that honors the past, embraces the present, and sets the stage for the future. It is a fitting conclusion to the Infinity Saga, blending action, emotion, and character development in a way that few films of its scale can achieve. For fans of the MCU, it is an unforgettable experience and a testament to what can be achieved when storytelling, character, and spectacle are perfectly balanced.",10
An Epic And Poetic Conclusion To A Decade of Madness,28 April 2019,"(No spoilers here) Avengers: Endgame is a triumph. I couldn't think of a more satisfying conclusion to this era of the MCU. It starts off slow, but still very interesting. The first two acts definitely focus more on character work than having a very tightly paced film that doesn't even allow you to breathe such as Infinity War. We start out with the main cast in a state of defeat and devastation from the events of Infinity War and let me just say, we get some great, great, great performances here. The acting in this movie is so freaking good! The first act takes the characters down some really unexpected paths. Some of them I was all for, but two of them (won't say who) I found questionable. Once the second act starts and they come up with a plan to undo what Thanos did in Infinity War, that's when things get REALLY interesting. They time travel back to a few past MCU movies and not only deliver nostalgia and great payoffs, but also gives a deeper understanding and a greater appreciation for these past movies. There were also quite a few ""Oh shoot!"" moments as well. The first two acts were great, but the third was freaking mind boggling! The set piece, the action, the scope, the intensity, the stakes, the jaw dropping moments, the raw emotion, it's all here and I could not think of a better final battle. Just wow! This movie does carry quite a deal of heavy moments and a couple of death scenes which are very impactful. A lot of people in my theater were silently crying at the end. I didn't, but man it hurt! My favorite characters in the film were probably the big three (Cap, Iron Man, and Thor). If I had to choose one, it would have to be Cap. The completion to his arc was just incredible. Poetic, sweet, and extremely heartfelt. Just brilliant. There are a few (and I mean very few) gripes/nitpicks I have with this movie, but the magnitude of this film's greatness effortlessly gobbles up those tiny little nuisances. If you're a person like me who has seen every MCU film, then this movie was incredibly rewarding. However, if you're going into this movie blind or only having seen a few years f the MCU entries, it's likely you'll get confused quite often and miss most of the great callbacks. But I think you would find that there's still a ton of fun to be had with this one.

Sweet, powerful, epic, emotional, gargantuan, poetic, symbolic, deep, rewarding, shocking, unpredictable, satisfying, Avengers: Endgame is a movie that will most definitely be talked about for generations. The MCU is truly the Star Wars of this generation. My grade: A+",10
The Best Movie Ever,26 April 2019,,10
Great effects,13 September 2019,This movie have fantastic effects and I love its music.,8
Moderately Good,3 June 2019,"Strongly believe that infinity war was a way more superior movie, with way more memorable scenes and a buildup to an impactful ending. While endgame incorporates all the characters in the story, it makes me feel less emotion for any of them. It was not a waste of money, no doubt, but it felt like the movie was being carried by audience feels for individual characters more than an exciting plot.",8
Unsnap,6 May 2019,"When I saw Infinity wars I knew the next movie will deal with unsnaping and the defeat of Thanos. After a year of waiting I saw the movie like everybody else. The sense of loss and of losing someone is tremendous both aspects are very different from comic books storylines, but for a movie it is important. In this movie the action, pace, and exuberance of supers is very less and slow. The concentration was given to human emotions, hopelessness and consequent coping to hard reality. However, few things I would avoided in scripting would the way in which they solved the problem and the credibility of the description of such powerful stones. Mysterious soul stone, its layer, reason for sacrifice all has meaning except for the convenience of the plot. Time stone description in Dr.Strange has no role either. This entire movie fooled everyone by think stones have tremendous possibilities but it was just meant for the plot. That was disappointing. However it is master piece considering the way in which it was made. If I had to analyze and nitpick all the plot holes it would be full of spoilers. So I would say watch the movie and enjoy the epic conclusions.",8

Some of the theories used in the movie create plot holes which are well taken care of. Some of the parts of the movie is not well explained. It is a lot to grasp at the first watch. I thought that Robert Downey Jr performed brilliantly. The movie clocks well over 3 hours, but in the end keeps you wanting more. It opens up a wide future for the MCU to take shape into.

The performances are stellar, particularly from the lead actors who bring depth and emotion to their roles. The cinematography adds to the suspense, capturing both the frenetic energy of the chase scenes and the quiet moments of reflection. While some plot twists may be predictable, the overall narrative is engaging and satisfying. The film's exploration of moral dilemmas and the consequences of choices adds a layer of complexity that elevates it above typical action fare. ""End Game"" is a must-watch for fans of the genre, offering thrills, suspense, and thought-provoking themes in equal measure.",9
"Fantastic ending, continue reading with caution:",26 April 2019,,8
The Grand Finale,3 September 2023,"The finale ten years in the making, an ending that was able to provide on so many aspects from the last decade of MCU films, 19 films, 3 phases, and hundreds of characters and arcs all given their rightful exit. I think it's nice that you can always look back on the early MCU and have it end here, with the next two Spider-Man films also serving as a sweet epilogue/bonus.

What I love the most is that each member of the original six Avengers had their own full circle moment, mostly. While Banner executed the snap and Thor had that important conversation with his mother, I felt like they had the least satisfying ending amongst the rest. Barton and Natasha's relationship came to a beautiful end with her demise, which provided a strong emotional core to the film. Tony and Steve were rightfully at the centre of this grand finale. In The Avengers (2012), their heated exchange is one of my favourite scenes in the entire MCU, and the way everything that happens after that between them links back to that is really satisfying. As you look back on the MCU, with all it's divisiveness and flaws, I think you can strongly argue that Tony Stark and Steve Rogers were beautifully written foils to one another in their character and actions.

There is a lot of rushed CGI, especially with the time-travel suits, they do not look planned at all and are underwhelming. Some jokes have become really outdated, or never landed. Not as many impressive action sequences as it's predecessor, but the grand final battle makes up for that. The final Trinity scene is incredible, plus Stark's suit is gorgeous here. It's not as tight as Infinity War, but it still stands as a great finale filled with great moments and arc conclusions.

It's true that there is an abundance of characters that the film has to deal with, especially trying to fit in every single one of them in the last act, but I feel like this film was able to do it's job as best as it ever could have, and is a conclusion to a feat In blockbuster filmmaking that many people may look down on right now, but will learn to appreciate in future years. Creating an entire universe through multiple standalone and crossover films, was bound to attract criticism, but in the end, Endgame was able to deliver on it's promises, and end it on a high-note.",9
I feel like I teleported into the Marvel universe...,26 April 2019,"The ending of this great saga really reaches deep to tie up loose ends and make the ending a satisfactory, thirst-quenching resolution to what started so long ago-in a small cave somewhere-with a desperate Tony Stark and the birth of a hero.",8

Most overrated and rushed big budget movie I've ever watched,12 September 2019,"Pretty much 90% of the user reviews already say what I want to say so I'll keep it short. This movie was so much worse, in every way, than Infinity War. Which is a shame and it's not gonna get a low score because of how overrated it is, even though most people leave reviews saying how much they hated it. It just sucks that THIS is the ending to the decade long series we all grew up with.",6
A mind blowing epic conclusion to an Infinity saga,5 May 2019,"One thing I did before seeing endgame was to avoid all teaser and trailers and spoilers. With that said, I had no idea about what I am going in to see apart from what I had imagined in my mind as to what's going to happen next and I can tell you that most of what I had thought really did not happen that way. I would advise to watch a recap of MCU on YouTube and do watch Infinity War once more to refresh your memory. Just like infinity war, the movie starts right off the bat, moving story forward in a well paced manner. Since movie is three hours long they divided the movie into three sections, all sections well used:

1. Gather the avengers 2. Make and execute the plan 3. Final battle

The movie is so well paced that the three hours just went by and there is not a single moment where you will lose your interest or get bored. The best part about the movie is the way how the past Marvel movies are connected to this one will be a surprise treat for you. Marvel has done justice to bring Thanos to big screen and given him two movie to fully show what he actually is capable of doing. He is no joke and you will see it in the later part of the movie. He is the baddest villain and the final battle has proved it.

This movie was not all about action, as a matter of fact only last part of the movie is action yet still the movie manages to hold its audiences with a bunch of surprises and to the edge of their seat during final battle. The mission are also going to keep you tight on your seat. The movie is full of humor thanks to Rocket and Thor and Iron man. Surprisingly Hulk has some great comic moments as well.

At the end the movie pays homage to previous marvel movies and their characters whose story ends with Endgame however they could be back anytime if Marvel wants them to. This is one in a life time movie that you will remember. Don't miss it and watch it in theater.",10

Eventhough i'm not the biggest fan, I still loved it, and Everyone have to see this movie",8
The End of An Era in Epic Style,26 April 2019,"The end of an era, Endgame wraps up the Infinity Saga in epic fashion, with massive fan service, emotional gravitas, a darker Thanos, psychological war-aftermath reflection, & one of the greatest final acts in blockbuster history. 9.4/10.

...

10 years, 21 movies, 32 heroes. The MCU as we know it just came to an end, and did so as epically as one could have possibly expected. Avengers: Endgame is one of, if not THE best and definitive Marvel film - and absolutely warrants the hype.

The film opens into a desolate landscape post-Infinity War where our heroes are still coming to terms with the magnitude of their failure. Despite glimpses of levity-full psychological war aftermath reflection on topics like survivor's guilt and PTSD, I'll admit: I was mildly disappointed with the first act. Overly comedic and light-defused in tone, it's a bit discordant with the tragic events that just happened to trillions of life forms. It was also a bit anticlimactic having them find and confront Thanos so easily and early. However, these flaws are mostly sequestered in the first third (despite a weird intellectual Hulk and fat Thor just horrifying to watch), and are ~easily forgiven in light of what follows.

Everything after the first act is masterful, dazzling fan service on a massive scale that will leave any Marvel or superhero fan speechless with their jaw-dropped. The middle act's time travel plotting makes for some incredible scenarios visiting past MCU films and having heroes interacting with their past selves. This was the magic of DC's Flashpoint comic arc, and although the film borrows its idea, it executes it perfectly. Thrillingly paced are the signature smooth-fluid action sequences The Russo Brothers are known for and exhibited ever since The Winter Soldier, as well as strong direction and intricate handling of such a monstrous scale of a story arc trying to beat Thanos before he even knows what's happened.

The Avengers once again find solace in the splitting up of them into mini-teams leading to some hilarious and intriguing character combinations different from Infinity War. Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Hulk, Black Widow, Hawkeye now Ronin, and the rest of the original 6 (plus a few others) are sent off into different teams and time periods to retrieve the stones, and it makes for some incredible entertainment value alone worth the price of admissions to watch. The Easter Eggs and cameos are downright legendary, showcasing what we already learned in IW: Anthony and Joe Russo are huge Marvel junkies who know and love the films/comics as much as the person reading this review.

Thanos and his far darker tone. Thanos is also off scouring for the Stones while all this is happening. His pulling of the strings in things like sending rogues and strategically planting things to upset the Avengers' plans make him far more imposing than his rogue commando style in IW. Much akin to what Darkseid - DC's original titan/god that came out first and, yes, Thanos was cloned from - would be like, there's far more power in resources at your disposal and being able to fling them at your will. He also has a bite and far darker tone here, being pissed off The Avengers are wrecking his plans after knowing he won and promising to not only kill half of life now, but ALL life and start over again under his rule.

Finally, the final act. I cannot even find the words to describe how legendary the final act of Endgame is - it might be one of the greatest final acts in blockbuster HISTORY. Like the Wakanda war on acid, this massive scale battle starting with the three most iconic Avengers against Thanos and evolving into a sheer epic warzone with every Marvel character you could possibly imagine, it will leave any fan speechless. And that's nothing compared to the heart-breaking ending with sacrifices that do the characters proud and have potentially-massive implications for the future of the MCU.

Overall, while there are nits to pick from its ~anticlimactic humorous opening to its handling of Thor/Hulk to its lack of a post-credits scene (REALLY wanted an X-Men or Eternals tease..), Avengers: Endgame is an absolutely masterful film that delivers just about everything you could expect from it as a follow-up to Infinity War. The end of an era, Avengers: Endgame wraps up the Infinity Saga in epic fashion, with massive fan service, emotional gravitas, a darker Thanos, psychological war aftermath reflection, and one of the greatest final acts in blockbuster HISTORY. It will be dang near impossible to wait to see what comes next.

Overall Score: 9.4/10",9

It's a lofty goal but if anyone has a chance to pull it off it is Anthony and Joe Russo. These two directors have now become Marvel stalwarts thanks to their impressive skills with Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Captain America: Civil War and the adored Avengers: Infinity War.

I can't go any further without stating that there will be spoilers in this review as I have to discuss some aspects of the plot so be wary going ahead. I will also state though I won't bring anything in that is from the third act of Avengers: Endgame.

Plot!

With the opening of Avengers: Endgame we see the team and the world is still reeling from the events of the ""Snapture"". There is however a glimmer of hope with the arrival of Captain Marvel (Larson) and some new leads on Thanos (Brolin). So the gang assemble (as you do for one of these big films) and head out ready to finally make Thanos pay and possibly save the victims of his action.

Unfortunately, revelations are revealed and everyone is broken even more so than the previous battle. Fast forward 5 years and the world and the universe are vastly different. Our remaining heroes are scattered to the four corners of the universe and people are trying to move on. That is until Ant-Man (Rudd) shows up. Here we are at the end of all things. It's been over a decade with over 20 films leading to this, Avengers: Endgame. Starring Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, and many, many more Avengers: Endgame hopes to bring the Infinity Saga as it is known now to a satisfying climax. It's a lofty goal but if anyone has a chance to pull it off it is Anthony and Joe Russo. These two directors have now become Marvel stalwarts thanks to their impressive skills with Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Captain America: Civil War and the adored Avengers: Infinity War. I can't go any further without stating that there will be spoilers in this review as I have to discuss some aspects of the plot so be wary going ahead. I will also state though I won't bring anything in that is from the third act of Avengers: Endgame.

What did you do!? Avengers: Endgame is a love letter to fans of both the Marvel comics and the MCU. This means it has all the power of the 21 films behind it. Unfortunately, it also has several of the trappings that have been in each of those films that are amplified by such a major event film. For example, this film is one part a sequel to Avengers: Infinity War but it is also a continuation of Thor's narrative from Thor: Ragnarok. These two elements do not mix as the choices that the Russo brothers make in regard to Thor are laughable and easily could have been handled better. I can see where they are going with how Thor is handling himself after the events of both Ragnarok and Infinity War but they fumble here and Thor is not the only one who suffers. Hulk and Captain Marvel are also mishandled in my opinion. Captain Marvel is a plot device not a character in this film. Reports came out recently that Brie Larson filmed this before her solo outing and it shows in how the Russo brothers utilise her. With regard to the Hulk and Bruce, their whole character narrative is fanservice with no real depth to it. It's a shame because I was looking forward to where Hulk and Bruce were going. On the positive side Captain America (Evans), Iron Man (RDJ) and Black Widow (Johansson) are handled far better. With Cap and Tony, it's again further fan service but with Widow, there is a journey and it's impressive. It's a combination of great acting on Johansson's part and interesting narrative choices. In the end though there are two MVP's in Avengers: Endgame and it's Jeremy Renner and Paul Rudd. Their respective character arcs are emotionally charged and I loved it. They have quiet scenes that bookend the big brawls and it's greatly appreciated. On the topic of the big brawls there is a fair sense of scope and grandeur. The cinematography is decent and there are several moments of awe-inspiring shots that look ripped straight from the comics. They are splash pages in every meaning of the word. Avengers Assemble! There are many moments that fans will cheer over. Moments that will have them in tears clutching their significant other and that is wonderful. I myself cried at multiple points in the film but I am a sucker for these tropes. I can say hand on my heart I will cry at the end of Supernatural when it comes to its conclusion at the end of season 15 but I know that it's not all been award winning. This is the same fact for Avengers: Endgame. There are payoffs to many narrative elements for almost every character across the MCU and some of them are great but there are also payoffs that are just jokes and they clash with the tone of what is supposedly an end of an era. There's even a section in this 3-hour ""epic"" that comes across like a victory lap of sorts. Where the cast seems to be like - Hey remember how great this was? It's unfortunate and it felt like something out of a long-running television series.

Whatever it takes Avengers: Endgame is a tough film to dissect. In one hand I adored the emotional beats, and several of the character arcs were engaging. However, there are so many issues. The clashing of tones, the misrepresentation of characters from this film as opposed to the last film we saw them in.

There is no doubt in my mind that Avengers: Endgame is going to make a ton of money that fans will eat it up but it is by no means a perfect film.",8
Fan service,6 May 2019,Entertaining movie. Mostly just fan service and weird plot holes. Go watch it. You've invested 10 years now. It's funny,8
Good But Not Great,6 May 2019,"A nice fun movie for comic lovers and families to watch. Entertaining. This film is really good but not great. It is much better than Infinity War and miles over that nonsense we saw called Age of Ultron. In spite of how good this film is, this really did not need to be 3 hours long. Maybe 2 hours 20 minutes, most of the beginning scenes were out of place and even some of the ending scenes. The action scenes were good quality, one of the best I've scene in a movie. The acting wasn't great, but good. Although this movie's storyline isn't The Dark Knight/Rises, Shawshank Redemption, or Empire Strikes Back quality, I am confused as to why the rating is a 9. The storyline is pretty average. Again, fun movie to watch, but not a movie I would watch more than twice. I've grown up a comic fan and have loved super heroes before they were considered cool, but don't expect this movie to meet beyond your expectations. It is all hype. That said I give this movie an 8 at the most.",8
One great scene is not enough,25 April 2019,,6
10 Years,27 April 2019,This emotional ending is perfectly balanced with the action packed setup from Infinity War. Marvel did an amazing job making an often-surprising and satisfying movie to tie up all the plot threads. There is nothing quite like the MCU and this movie displayed how far Marvel has taken each of its characters relationships throughout the last 10 years. Loved it!,9
WTF ?,30 April 2019,,7
"Killed all the other movies, big deception.",4 August 2019,,1
End of an Era,30 May 2024,"Avengers: Endgame masterfully weaves together the storylines of over 20 preceding MCU films, offering fans a satisfying and emotional farewell to beloved characters and narratives. It is a monumental achievement in filmmaking. It successfully delivers a conclusion that is both epic and intimate, honoring the legacy of its characters while providing a satisfying narrative closure. The film's combination of stellar performances, impressive action sequences, and deep emotional resonance make it a standout entry in the superhero genre. For fans of the MCU, Endgame is not just a movie; it is a heartfelt tribute to a decade of storytelling that has redefined modern cinema.",9
Culmination of 10 yrs of efforts is there for all to see,26 April 2019,"Well, there's no two ways about a Marvel movie: all out CGI, rib tickling humour, emotions, a very minimalistic feel of a possible romantic link up, catchy one-liners - all offered in a close to a 3hrs movie (to get the viewer interested in each one of the characters is a task no human can be 100% successful at) - as expected. All said and done, it's well worth the hype, and the wait. I still remember the good old days (at the start of Ironman franchise) thinking Ironman is meant to do something bigger. Marvel fans: that moment has arrived!!

The only thing negative about this movie is: Thanos as a villain has little to do, even in this 3hour long saga; all his powers seem pointless in front of the endless list of superheroes.",8
A great end to an amazing story!,23 May 2019,So sad about some character's passing but this was an amazing watch and a great end!,10
Avengers-palooza!,27 April 2019,"This is a kitchen sink movie, in that you get everything but the kitchen sink in it! The three hours flies by mostly due to the fact that the action rarely stops. It's a movie filled with laughs and tears and goodbyes. A couple of scenes seemed shoe horned in to appease the folks clamoring for more ""Woke"" moments. Those scenes aside, most of this epic movie is solidly put together and wonderfully presented. Without spoiling anything, I was scratching my head at some of the logic behind science in the movie that goes against every thing any movie viewer has ever seen, but I have a policy of throwing logic to the wind on super hero movies. What's the point when you have people flying and teleporting across space. I've read this movie is a love letter to fans of the MCU. I'd agree with that, and would add that if it was a love letter, Robert Downey Jr. signature would be at the end, in the center, and slightly larger than anyone else.",9
Made for the fans,3 May 2019,"Eleven-year wait is finally over. The Endgame hit theatres on April 24th, and the word ""hit"" might be the best way to put it. The culmination of a comic-book phenomenon called ""The Avengers"" is set to become the most successful film in terms of box-office gross, as well as be generally regarded as the best comic-book movie ever made.

The story takes place in the so-called MCU, a universe where all the superheroes reside. Established 11 years ago with the release of the first film, The Iron Man, at that time tricky move has proven to be a resounding success and changed the lives of everyone involved. Marvel managed to build a universe so mesmerizing it has made fans always coming back for more. With the last film closing the chapter, it was Marvel's responsibility to do justice to this franchise. And it seems that they didn't disappoint.

The film plays on a sentimental note, leaving viewers with a nostalgic feeling. This is done by referencing to the past movies, and even revisiting the old sets. Slightly less action-packed than the former Infinity War, The Endgame focuses on the journey of the original Avengers, but still, or perhaps because of this, manages to take many surprising turns. It is nothing new that the stories of some of these characters are coming to an end, but don't make this prevent you from going to see this film! The death sequences are dealt with graciously, avoiding overused clichés. They leave you feeling heart-broken, but also satisfied with the epic conclusion.

The only think that I find to be irritating was the song repertoire. Although the songs usually fit the scenes in which they appeared, they didn't tie the story together, making it a little chaotic and inconsistent.

All in all, The Endgame is an achievement in both, cinematography and storytelling, and is a must-see for every cinephile.",9

So, a 7 for hour 1 and 2, and a strong 9 for the last.",8

Not sure where to rate this...,21 May 2019,"I'm not sure where to rate this movie because there's a lot of different angles to it. There are many plot holes. There is some humor that doesn't work as well as I'd like it to. I don't believe it's the best marvel movie. BUT... this movie is awesome. Make me feel something real from just a screen and you've achieved something and the Russo brothers did just that. Yes, the time travel logic will definitely not be accurate if you take the ""time"" (see what I did there) to dissect it, but this film did something pretty new. It connected over 20 movies into one grand conclusion that pays off better than any other piece of media that I've ever seen. Problems with the flick? A few sure. Any resentment? Pretty much none. You can't please everyone, but these guys probably did the best job they could and I love them 3000",9

*The Epic Finale*,26 July 2024,,10
Marvel united (part 4),27 November 2019,"In just five days of worldwide exhibition, this ultra-high budgeted 'Hollywood Movie' managed to accumulate a hundred million spectators (1.2 billion U.S. Dollar in revenue) thanks to an amazing collaboration of initial 'Marvel' producer Kevin Feige (p.g.a.) and directors 'The Russo Brothers' as the sticking together ensemble cast of 2012's 'Marvel's Avengers' take revenge on supervillain 'Thanos'; vocally performed with no remorse by Josh Brolin, known for 'Best Picture of the Year' Academy Award winning picture ""No Country for Old Men"" (2007) directed by 'The Coen Brothers'.

'Endgame' does the trick of reminding the 2018's 'Infinity War' viewers' memory in starting with Academy Award nominating worthy drama before opening the desperately needed science-fiction action in the second hour of total three as world famous actors, Robert Downey Jr., Scarlett Johannsson, Chris Evans and Mark Ruffalo as the all-balanced, genetically-fixed 'Hulk' (to name a selected few) come together again to travel back in time, real ""Back To The Future: Part 2"" (1989) style, fixing all arguably done mistakes of romancing the 'Infinity Stones' to recover companion- as friendship of deceased 'Avengers' fellows as the beloved Marvel characters 'Spider-Man' and 'Black Panther' remerge.

In the end there is no disappointment emotionally, the Disney / Marvel merger of 2009 used all their filmmaking powers to deliver the ultimate 'Event' picture due to the interweaving grid of story-telling splendour initially incepted in 2008's 'Iron Man' - feeling just to go back and start 'The Journey' all over again.",
Entire movie,8 August 2019,"It's just a masterpiece, everything is looking pretty good!",10
"Overhyped, not close to infinity stones",28 April 2019,"After a long time, watched a movie with high expectations. They were high not coz of marketing, but this finale had all the contents to make a masterpiece. Unfortunately one thing was missing and that was the story line. First two hours were long and boring. You can not make a movie by revisiting all old stuff again and that too in single movie. Time travel movies ain't meant to be actions ones with superheros playing saviours. When. You intent to make time travel stories, you should take some lessons from back to the future series. Back to the future series have been best coz it dealt with one. Good story line.

In infinity stones, for time travel events marvel never laid any stress on repercussion , also marvel. Made fun of hulks character. People would have loved to watch hulk bashing thanos to some extent.instead he was made a wuss.

Same thing happened with thor in endgame. One more superhero character degraded to pathetic levels.

30 min fight scenes at the end are. Moment of glory.. Still it can't be matched with infinity stones as they have much better locations in last part rather than dull battle field in this one.

In nut shell, a golden moment to create a great masterpiece has gone down the drains",7
What.... just happened...,25 April 2019,"I laughed I cried, I shouted at one point. I had my head in my hands. I had my hands in the air. I went back to the box office and booked again.

One word...... special.

See it to believe it, a masterclass in film making. And the perfect close to a decade of entertainment and a year of obsession and theorizing (and STILL being off the Mark.)",10
Fun but not entirely satisfying,5 May 2019,,7
It had 2.5 hours of blah blah and hardly 30 minutes of action,1 May 2019,I'm sorry but this movie was boring except for the last part. Infinity war was well balanced and every character had a role. Also had action from beginning to end. But endgame mostly had unnecessary talks or travelling here and there. Most main characters don't even have any fight scenes. Whole movie is focused on only 2-3 characters. Rest of the characters were in it like they just have a cameo. Should have made a semi team up film after infinity war and then Endgame with all the characters having enough screentime. Wasted opportunity.,1
It was alright,5 May 2019,"The Russo Brothers did an amazing job on this film the action sequences are so good, but the movie is basically 2 hours of comedy and 30 minutes of action, the movie also forgets about the snap and everyone's making jokes again. The ending was really good. The film pays a good tribute to the Characters and their actors.

3 Hours Too Long,17 June 2019,"This film is no Masterpiece. The Russo Brothers phoned in for a relevant follow-up to Infinity War. The first two hours were incredibly dull and boring. This film was filled to the brim with Fan Service and not enough Original Story. The final hour was amazing and worth the price of admission. The movie could've been condensed and it could've gotten to the point sooner. The humor feels forced and lazy. The film was filled with jump cuts and reused camera shots from previous films. The CGI is well done. The acting is poor at points. Overall, this is an average film, with two-thirds of it falling under below average.",6
A whole different caliber,24 April 2019,"Watched it in 4DX. Premiere morning. This film makes me happy, sad, gives me peace and anger at the same time. It's a new caliber of superheroes movie. 3 hours means nothing.

As other marvel films, the sound, the effect and CGI is a top class. Story wise, yes we will find some minor loophole, and yes, it's argueable, but I can't think of any major plot hole that can makes me hates this film. Especially it's a film that conclude all previous films.

If you feeling happy, angry, sad or peace, believe me we are did.. and that's why this film is amazing and beautiful. A film that truly 11/10. It's a no brainer if you think and feel the same as me.",10

Glorious 3 Hour Epics Are Back,25 April 2019,"It's impossible to watch a film of this much scale, history, cultural importance, and franchise-carrying characters in a vacuum. No other franchise has the balls, nor the emotional buildup that it carries to justify a 3-hour runtime in a world where those kinds of runtimes are limited to fantasy epics (Lord of the Rings) or old glorious 70 millimeter films (Lawrence of Arabia). I guess that's what best describes Endgame, it is a glorious and grossly satisfying epic, and one that will soon become a classic etched and immortalized in the cultural consciousness of a generation.

If there's one thing that Marvel has done properly, its understanding how to do good on their characters. The MCU has thrived because it has consistently followed a philosophy of putting characters first. There is a reason why this movie broke pre-sale records, why there were cheers, tears and rounds of applause from the audience in each shining moment of the film. Endgame takes Marvel's character-driven storytelling to its extreme and most appealing. Infinity War largely proved how Marvel knows how to divide it characters, unite them all with one common threat and theme, and deliver a punch in the gut ending that had fans dusting their tears.

At the start of Endgame, fans are at the same emotional headspace as their favorite characters who are at a loss for hope. Right off the bat, the Russo brothers as directors have put themselves in a corner that allowed them to find a creative way out of it. Together with screenplay writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, the story feels more rich, poignant, and satisfying. It goes without saying that you shouldn't go into this film expecting a high-art, indie slow burner, it still flows and feels very much like a Marvel movie, but the difference is that it is more restrained. The film opts for quieter, relaxed, and introspective scenes between characters. Steve, Tony, Clint, Natasha, Thor, and Banner all get their moments to shine, and it's clear that this is the original six's movie if Infinity War was Thanos'.

Each fan service moment feels earned, despite it being obviously shameless and pandering, it feels like the Avengers can justify showing off a little especially after 11 years of buildup. Nothing beats the collective gasps and thunderous applause you get from the audience whenever each iconic moment occurs. Endgame is clearly, unapologetically, and triumphantly made for the fans. Each scene, each line of dialogue and each callback is constructed passionately and with care. No arcs in the last 11 years were left forgotten and left in the dust.

As an epilogue to the now titled ""Infinity Saga"", this film works best as the season finale of a long running cinematic television epic. If you see it that way, you'll understand the motivations behind the creative decisions that the filmmakers made. Each plot point may feel overused or something you've seen before, but the people behind the scenes know it and even acknowledge it within the film. It doesn't mean they are unmotivated, but rather the opposite, they use it to stunning effect for incredibly emotional payoffs that honestly feels like a miracle that they managed to pull it off.

In the end, what more is there to say about this movie? Aside from its consistently stunning visuals, creative cinematography, coherent action set pieces, and kick-ass musical score, this film is all about emotion and getting the catharsis you've always wanted as a fan, a normal moviegoer, or as a little kid. Some people grew up with the MCU, 11 years is a damn long time and I'm definitely part of those who did. I guess this is what those kids in the 70s-80s felt when they saw Star Wars.

Verdict: 4.8/5",10

AMAZING MOVIE,24 February 2024,"The use of Captain marvel in this film was just ridiculous. Shes there at the start, bails for some reason? And then pops up at the end to serve no purpose but deux ex machina a space ship...

The past thanos part wasn't necessary when you think about it, they could've done this film without a real 'villain' And it would've worked and been a original take on a super hero film without using the same formula we have seen in 10+ super hero films already. The entire final battle felt like a rehashed messy battle, with a bunch more characters against thanos - basically mixing the space battle from infinity war; iron man, spider man etc and the final battle of infinity war with captain america, thor etc.. mashing those two into one within this new film. The scenes of trying to pull the gauntlet off his hand.. it all felt like a rehash.",
Outstanding !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,24 April 2019,"After 11 years, Avengers: Endgame is a truly MCU's finest hour ! This will be the most satisfying movie ever had from the MCU, and the Russo brothers dedicated everything to gives this cinematic achievement as a celebration to Marvel's brand and an epic conclusion to Infinity's Saga.

But with the #DontSpoilTheEndgame's trend, I suggest that you should go see the movie immediately ! The less you know, the fun and the best experience you'll have to this amazing film.

For me, It is such a great big film as much as The Return of the King and Ben-Hur ! (Possibly, it might be Ben-Hur to this generation too.) And as much as a superheroes film goes, I says this is the best Superheroes film of the decade (or in 2010's) that could go along with the greatness of The Dark Knight.

Thank you, Kevin Feige. Thank you, Joe and Anthony Russo. Thank you, to all the MCU's cast. Thank you, Disney. You guys just made a classic film for everyone and I hope Stan Lee proud on this great cinematic achievement.",10

A decent film, certainly not what was expected (the trailer is very, very misleading, which is a good thing in this case) however some characters were basically ruined for the sake of humour or that they couldn't be shoe-horned into the already overflowing roster, also there was in my opinion two kinda inescapably obvious flaws with the story which I won't spoil because honestly, I don't need to, I could hear the people sitting behind me and to my right say ""what? How?"" So I knew it wasn't just me overthinking it. The film is good, don't get me wrong, but it's not a ""10/10 omg I cried and laughed and what a masterpiece"" film that some of these reviews are saying it is.

It's better than most MCU films, but it's no Winter Soldier or Iron Man by any means.",8

A concerning lack of darkness...,25 April 2019,"I do enjoy the ending but I am quite disappointed with Endgame's whole execution.

It felt like a slap stick comedy rather than the dark Avengers movie it was supposed to be. I don't mind jokes here and there, like in Infinity War, but it was a lot of it, even til the point that I found it disturbing.

Thor and Thanos was quite redeemed in IW but their portrayals here feels like a slap in the face. Are MCU even aware that Thanos was so well written that he has a fanbase?

This isn't a worthy ending for Phase 3 and MCU as we know it. It was just OK.",6

This was one of the most epic battles ever in Film History,4 August 2019,Yes I gave this movie a ten ... like i gave to Good Fellas or Casino or Aliens or Terminator 2. Why ? Because this movie is one of the best actions movies ever... CGI ... Actors... Story Directors ... are incredible. Yes it cost 360.000.000 USD ... the most expensive movie ever ... but at least they made an incredible Superhero Movie ... Marvel understood from the beginning how to make an entertaining film. I like Zack Snyder but the DC Comics movies are just trying it to make it serious ... Come one we want fights and funny conversations like in the comics ... The Story might be not 100 % in line or believable yeah give me a break we are talking about Superheros here ... they can do anything :) I am now waiting for the 4 Bluray Box for the Avengers and the 3 Bluray Boy of Captain America ... For me it ended now .... Great experience ... and I think it will take mabe some decades before they can do somethng like this again.,10
A True Masterpiece,3 November 2019,"The Russo Bro's should be commended by what they brought to the BIG SCREEN! this movie is GOLD! everything about it is non-stop fun, emotional thrill ride especially if you have followed the franchise for years. The tears will fall but the smiles will grow bigger than ever before. Some say 3 hours is too long but it's not long enough, I could spend forever growing with these Hero's and the wonderful actors portraying them, feel like a kid again and wishing I was a superhero! Heartwarming in all the right places. 10/10 my favorite movie of all time!",10
Nothing like this ever!,24 April 2019,"It is absolutely the best....I can say without doubt...there are many movies in the universe...but endgame is one in a billion....action packed,emotional ... good story...full of humour. There's nothing like it",10
Perfection,24 April 2019,"I cried. I laughed. I was shocked. My expectations were blown away. Perfection, enough Said.",10
An amazing experience.,24 April 2019,This movie was a true experience. I enjoyed every single second of it. It was epic.,10
"The movie was ok, but far from being great",30 April 2019,,6
It's not infinity part 2 but it's beyond that.,24 April 2019,"Shocking start and a very shocking ending according to my perspective. What to expect in this movie is lots of emotions, laughs and surprises. It's a movie to remember",10
Best movie ever judging from other review has great character development,24 April 2019,"SO GOOOOOOD it has every emotion in one sadness, happiness, joy, it has everything there were a few scenes that were a bit cringe but other than that a near perfect",7
"Could have been so, so, so much better",26 June 2019,,3
Non spoiler review,24 April 2019,"Avengers: Endgame (2019, Russo Brothers)

So the culmination of eleven years worth of set up in this Marvel Cinematic Universe that feels like an episodic tv series is about to have its finale and its a big one... over three hours. This film is sure to satisfy those who have been impressed with the last couple of phases of Marvel films, I personally gravitate towards the Phase One films. This direct sequel to last years Infinity War starts off quite slow for the first hour or so and I think this will be the main complaint by most people but I did not mind the low key hangs with these surviving characters. The film does pick up though and has a few laughs along the way, some above average action, fun hijinx but the whole time I am thinking this story is wasted on these terrible visual directors. Marvel films are all pretty bland but the Russos make spectacle so damn ugly. That said most of the conclusions are satisfying from a story point of view bar some small missteps here and there.",
Where do I start with this rubbish,26 April 2019,,9
Perfect just perfect,24 April 2019,It is the perfect end to 10 years of amazing film making!,10
I LOVE THE MOVIE 3000!!,26 April 2019,No words. What an INCREDIBLE JOURNEY!! Go watch the movie as blind as possible.,10
Sorry not 9 or 10,24 April 2019,,8
Endgame...,14 July 2021,,10
They really pulled it off near perfection,25 April 2019,After disappointment with both infinity war which on 2nd viewing wasn't as bad as I remembered either and also captain marvel it was a mixture of nerves and hope they could cap it off properly and boy did they deliver the best 3 hours of film I can remember that absolutely flew by. The perfect ending to a largely amazing set of films. A truly mind blowing experience.,10
Very overrated,27 April 2019,"Redundant plot, unnecessary long, unexplainable events and meaningless humour!",6
This movie left me speechless,24 April 2019,"There are no words that can deacribe how well made this movie is. The CGI, the acting, the characters, the story.. everything about this movie is just.. wow!",10
"Lovely, but full of plot holes.",26 April 2019,,6
Couldn't get behind it,25 August 2019,,3
A fantastic end of a chapter,27 April 2019,"I've been looking forward to this for so long, and it surpassed all my expectations. It is a thrilling ride, an emotional journey, and has comedic moments as well. It even causes tears to fall. I can't wait to watch it again.",
PERFECT END,28 April 2019,All i wanted from marvel thank you to all cast of endgame you're my true heros ♥,10
woow,4 October 2019,The best movie ever it's good to finaly make a movie that beat avatar,9
What people seem to be missing here...,26 April 2019,,10
One of the best movie of all time,26 April 2019,"Initially I was really excited for 3 hours movie, thinking what could have been the story. But to be honest, the story line gave me goosebumps. Endgame is the rollercoaster of happiness, excitement and sorrows. Each and every turn, there is something different. I enjoyed the movie. I enjoyed it to the pieces. Sometimes, tears of happiness and sadness rolled down.

Can't give spoiler. It's a must watch.",10
the best end for the best saga,26 January 2024,"This film concludes an era, both of Marvel and of my heart. The Avengers were a fundamental part of my childhood and raised me by giving me sources of inspiration that I would not have found without them. This film for its importance and also its beauty, is the best Marvel movie of all time. I'm just sad to think that it's all over, but I'm glad that you had the best possible conclusion, for what has been the best movie house ever, which has succeeded most of the time in confirming itself with great superhero films. Needless to say, without these actors would not have been the same story. Robert Downey Jr. Is Tony Stark, and for those who have followed everything from the beginning I think you will always remember him by the name Tony or Iron Man. Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, Tom Holland and all the others were also fundamental to the realization of a universe that is no longer only understood as cinema, but as a family. Thanos is one of the best antagonists in the film world, especially for his motivations. Three hours of pure show, fabulous direction, spectacular visual effects and well-told story. A spectacular closing of an even better cycle. I don't understand how many people think this film is not up to the task it was meant to perform, madness. Trust me, even if you are not lovers of Marvel or superheroes in general, this film is not only science fiction, but above all heart.

Thank you Marvel.

. Rating: 9.9/10.",10
Best movie,12 May 2019,"Best movie till date , awesome work by marvel cinematic universe",10
Fan service and cheesy plots does not make a good ending,27 April 2019,"Poor character development
a lot of unnecessary characters that barely have a line
weird pacing
last act was pretty much a reenact of IW where they actually win",6
Greatest Movie Ever,29 April 2019,This movies is the greatest superhero movie to ever be created. Robert Downey jr. portray Iron man I couldn't see anyone else playing as iron man. This movie is very sad because it's an end of an error this has been a 11 year in to the making of this movie. I would suggest to watching this movie there a great story and excellent finishing,10
A let down,24 April 2019,Ehh it was predictable and the last one was better,6
Hulk gets no second chance to fight Thanos,29 April 2019,"What can I say the title says it all, the director is really screwed up with the hulk he didn't even have a decent fight scene. The story it was kind of boring also fell asleep practically in the middle of the movie. This movie felt like a Hollywood director made it instead of a real fan the way it should have been made. And the CGI was horrible",1
"Epic, it's just EPIC!!",24 April 2019,Can't Say nothing it's the greatest Superhero movie of all time,10
what will Marvel give me the next 10 years?,24 April 2019,,10

More than EPIC! Defining cinematic event.,27 April 2019,I can't think of a movie that covers the scope of End Game.,10
The best,24 April 2019,It was really amazing! Definitely one of the best marvel movies!! Worth watching!!,10
That's not fair to Thot and Hulk,27 April 2019,I got disappointed about Thor and Hulk. And the Directors of Marvel for making the Thor and Hulk too weak. The reason i went first day first show because to see Thor. Russo brothers is suck.,6
Good ending,24 April 2019,Almost as good as infinity.. But hey.. You gotta see it 😉,8
Wanted to go out after one hr,28 April 2019,,6

The End,9 December 2021,,9
Heroic,8 December 2023,"A superior acting performance, a legendary movie that will not be forgotten. Love this movie and soundtrack, avengers theme song, best casting. I watched the last two Avengers movies for the first time in a private hall and I was very impressed. Why do I need to write 600 words here? Can't it be 150? What is the need for long Articles? I don't want to give spoilers, the movie was amazing in every aspect, I recommend everyone to watch it, I watched it 3 times in the cinema. What more do I need to write? Aren't all these comments enough? And finally, the series will continue, stay tuned. I Love it.",10
Epic movie,2 February 2020,"Movie is perfect, perfect final to infinity saga, thanks marvel",10
Glad it's over. Over-hyped to the max.,28 April 2019,"This is one over hyped movie that under delivers. Marvel really is comedy and lacks the darker tone of the DC universe. Some people like the light Marvel universe but it's really lost something along the way. You need to throw common sense out the window with the this one and Captain Marvel, wtf haha. Enjoy.",6
"4 genre in one epic finale. A deeper film, not the usual superhero flick",25 April 2019,,10
Marvel Fatigue Setting In,15 May 2019,"I enjoyed watching the previous ones.Now this one is too long, 3 Hrs.",6
Extremely Disappointed!,10 May 2019,"For me, very boring and the characters persona as they were before just ruined in this movie. I have greatly enjoyed every Marvel movie except this one.",1
Espectacular,28 April 2019,"Some things that we already imagined happened, but there's much more to come",10
Come on...,18 December 2019,"I really liked this movie, but the plot holes. Wayyy too many plot holes and basically... with time travel unlocked they can do whatever now. Like, come on. Good idea but the execution was pretty awful. I still love the movie but I hate the billions of plot holes.",8
Like a lovely song,27 April 2019,"Perhaps there are to many people that hate this movie, and other that love, personally, I love it, its beautiful, a gift for us, the last minutes I've smiled and cried. Obviously it's a good movie, but something is wrong, I dont know what it's but something is odd, and it taste strange, but everything have to end, right?",9
Unbelievable,5 May 2019,"I don't even know how many times I said ""you are KIDDING ME!"" out loud, in the theater! It was a LOT of movie for the price of the tickets. So much closure, so many laughs, and also some tears. I don't think any movie will ever be as worth seeing ever again. Thank you, Marvel, for an incredible story. Just perfect.",10
This film is Amazing.,27 April 2019,You are putting yourself at a disadvantage if you never see this movie. The perfect ending to the perfect franchise.,10
"OMG, what a movie!",4 May 2019,"Every penny worth to watch! <3

A great and accomplished emotional roller coaster story. Got me into tears many times, and constant gave me goosebumps <3",10
it doesnt deserve a place in the top rated movies,30 April 2019,"It is a great movie, 3 great hours, but not great acting, there is no acting, just super heros costumes",7
Epic and emotional,28 April 2019,"Endgame is the best Marvel movie ever, that simple. Very funny, very emocional. Awesome soundtrack. And the last 50 minutes....OMG.",10
Mostly boring,28 April 2019,"The story line was mostly boring, the characters (banner and Thor) were embarrassing and I missed the funny dialogues.",6
Horrible,15 October 2020,Infinity War was a million times better than this trash,1
Perfect Haters always gonne hate,25 April 2019,Before this my all time favourite movie was Gladiator. But this one topped that . I have seen all Marvel movies more than one time. And the conclusion to all those movies is perfect. Ppl who don't like the story or the pace of the movie do not get what they tried to achieve over 22 movies. I can't see anything wrong with the movie. Things that bothered some ppl didn't bother me at all. This was the end of an era do ppl rlly want that fitted in a 2 hour movie NOoooo! Dont be a baby over the 3 hour sit. It is so worth it! If u can't see that than don't bother writing a review. I can accept bad reviews if they are thought trough. Everybody has their own taste but don't hate just to hate. I wrote this cause ppl that like movies don't leave reviews as often as ppl who don't like it. So go watch this movie and enjoy every second of it ;-),10
It's perfect,12 July 2019,I love it It's a very good movie to watch I'm from Iran and I love thid movie I follow this movie from the first episode of it,10
The best MCU film,3 July 2019,"This movie had so much riding on it, and it wins in every way, shape, and form. Avengers: Endgame manages to hold onto the comedy and drama the franchise is known for while being the most emotional film in the genre. In the theater there was an immense amount of crying, cheering, and laughing from the emotional opening scene to the absolutely epic and action-packed finale.

Avengers: Endgame is easily the best film in the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe and one of my favorite movies of all time.",10
Infinity Saga,28 May 2019,This movie was the perfect culmination of the past 10 years of story building for the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The threads they have been weaving for the characters and their connections to each other. You take this journey with then and the time jump to 2023 fixes any future cinematic timeline issues moving forward lol.,10
An unprecedented story telling with a nostalgic ending,28 April 2019,"A cinematic masterpiece ,an allrounder.a movie which will be remembered for a very long time.",10
Endgame end of MCU,21 November 2023,,10
Epic conclusion that somehow feels cheap,26 April 2019,,7
Sacred and personal experience,28 April 2019,All bias aside this movie is incredible and will change your life if you let it. 100% every question is answered and you will feel emotions that will shake you to the core. Incredibly well done and was truly a spiritual experience I mean that,10
I want the Russo's to throwout the handbook and make Endgame again,26 April 2019,,7
Another High Cost Superhero Movie with Low Cost Scenario,30 April 2019,,2
Brilliant Superhero Epic,9 October 2019,"Good performances, good dialogue driven scenes, nicely written emotional scenes, stunning visuals and an incredible third act. Such a wonderful culmination to 11 years of film making.",10
Satisfying conclusion to an epic saga,6 May 2019,"I love marvel movies. They aren't always the greatest movies, they are usually really good, but they are always fun. To tie all the stories together, develop these characters, create emotional connection, and still be fun and entertaining is no small task. Lost couldn't even end a couple of seasons on an island. This crosses time, reality, and space and yet still is a wonderfully satisfying conclusion to 22 films. Wonderful. Simply wonderful. Though why am I writing this? Is there really someone deciding whether or not to watch the epic conclusion to these movies based on an IMDb review?",10
Amazing,22 June 2019,Just magnificently the best part is that I can do it for a bit of time to get a copy of your website on the whole thing about ww2 you can you take it down loooool you are you gonna come to your mum is the most beautiful sound of the day after day and I don't think I'm going on with my family in the area of interest to you and I know they have fresh air you have,10
Best superhero movie ever.,25 June 2019,A must watch movie but only those who have watched previous parts will understand.,10
Not a good movie logically but a good movie emotionally,10 February 2020,"This is not at all a perfect movie. It has way too many plot holes and unanswered questions. But you can't deny that something like this has never been done in history, like having a 22 movie franchise within a span of 11 years, all interconnected and hitting the right emotions. For the people complaining about character development, you had almost spent 10 years with these characters. This is not a standalone movie and should not be seen as one. It is not meant for critis or awards, It is meant for fans. Not just movie fans but mainly Comic book fans. People complaining about hulk and in this movie should know that there are more than one green raging hulk in the comics and you are not less worthy of anything and thor showed that you are not less worthy even if you are internally broken and don't need to have a body like The Rock to be a superhero. I don't believe that it's a theme park, but I respect your opinion if you do.",8
A good MCU finale that should have blown me away,26 April 2019,"I was super hyped for Avengers: Endgame after the fantastic Avengers: Infinity War last year. I always wondered ""How were they going to top it?"" so what was the result after sitting in a cinema for almost 3 hours? I came out a little underwhelmed, honestly. I must stress that I don't think Endgame is a bad movie by any means, it's just the bar set by Infinity War was so high for me that all the shortcomings and issues I had with Endgame made me feel like it was the weaker half of the story by quite a significant amount in comparison.

One thing I really noticed in Endgame was the pacing and structure of the movie was all over the place. There were weird tangents in the story that didn't really go anywhere and were just used as a quick gag or fan service. Compared to Infinity War where everything flowed so smoothly, it felt to me Endgame's writing was quite sloppy in places. The jokes were not hitting quite as well, and characters were acting differently just for the sake of a contrived moment or joke to occur. Without spoiling anything, Thanos for example seems completely different in Endgame to what he was in Infinity War. There were just so many moments where characters were acting un-natural, that it was distracting.

As for the characters and emotional moments, Captain Marvel honestly might as well never have been in this movie. She barely does anything. Iron Man and Captain America get the most screentime for a good reason and have nice conclusions. The Hulk feels toned down here alot and left to the sides. Thor is mostly comic relief here, so if you never found Thor: Ragnarok funny, you might hate him big time here. The others have shared screentime and you do see alot of characters in this movie. It does have a big finale feel to it, and there are many nice references to previous Marvel movies in there too. If you've seen Back to the Future: Part II, that's basically how the Time Travel stuff works. Just try not to think about it too much, otherwise the inconsistencies might annoy you.

Overall, I still had a blast with Avengers: Endgame. I was never bored despite the lengthy running time. However, the reason why I felt a little let down, despite still liking it, is that re-watching Infinity War just the night before was close to perfection at telling that side of the story. The sequence of events, the humour, the emotional beats, and the characters all acted at their very best in Infinity War. Endgame to me, felt like a noticeable drop in quality despite the grandness and scale of it acting as a swan song to the MCU Universe. I'm not sure where Marvel can go from here. They've pretty much done the most epic Comic Book Superhero movie storyline they could have ever done, so what's next?

7.5/10",8
Kinda disappointing,26 April 2019,,7
WE CRIED.,1 May 2019,"It wasn't what we expected it to be. The whole thing, the effects, the whole plot, the way the writer and the director put everything they had into this film was what kept 90% of the audience at the edge of their seat. We cried. We cried a lot. So many feelings. We felt overwhelmed and couldn't help but cry our eyes out. No matter who you are, where you live or what you like, please, don't spoil this film. #dontspoiltheendgame",10
Overhyped,26 April 2019,"I would like to start by saying I'm a huge MCU fan. I completely get why people love this movie! it's a fun, end to a adventure that has been a part of many peoples lives for a long span of time. It is a great movie however it escapes me how people can watch this movie and not see huge flaws with the it. The best thing I can say is stuff just doesn't make sense.

*Stuff in shots that isn't there in the next shot. *Simple story explanations were not present. *overall the story felt bland actually.

With that said, overall you will have a good time watching the movie.",7
Disappointing,5 September 2019,"More than 2 hours of drama and only minutes of action...or at least that's what it felt like. Also, tons of that annoying Hollywood epic type of music to make me consider muting it.",3
An unforgettable conclusion,27 April 2019,"It's hard to put into words my feelings after seeing this film. Endgame is an epic, unpredictable, and emotional end to the most impressive long-form storytelling in cinematic history. This film is captivating for its entire 3 hour run time, with every scene and piece of dialogue carefully crafted with purpose. The payoffs and callbacks to previous moments in the MCU are amazing and reward those who have been loyal to this franchise. Avengers: Endgame absolutely surpasses the massive expectations it had and closes the book perfectly on an unprecedented saga of films.",10
Wow no spoilers here,28 April 2019,Have to say the best film I have ever seen. If you are prone to needing toilet breaks in the cinema wear a nappy!! As you cannot leave your seat watching it. Russo brothers thank you for delivering in my eyes a truly amazing experience and I have never had my emotions on such a rollercoaster ride watching a film. This reminds me of what a cinema experience should be as knew not much about what will happen and trailers didn't reveal the good bits. It was an epic and enjoyable film no need to stay for post credits either as there is none,10
Go watch it before someone spoils it!,24 April 2019,"THIS IS A NON SPOILER REVIEW Avengers Endgame picks up where Infinity War has ended. It's full of story, full of heart and full of respect for the characters that we know and love profoundly. It's also beautiful to look at and has much better editing than most of Marvel. There are beautiful long shots and it's a spectacular view. If you love Marvel, if you have seen all (and in this case I recommend seeing all MCU movies before this one - trust me, it will help you understand many parts) then you are probably going to love this. And the marketing did do it justice - it really feels like an end of an era.",10
No spoilers!!,28 April 2019,"The end of the 11 year of journey is here and what a movie it is we cried, laugh,joy the every movement foen the movie we can't express the movie in the words. Such a beautiful work by russo brothers and mcu and what a great end is given to all cherecters.",10
"Hilarious, fun, sad and utter most satisfaction",28 April 2019,"I went to watch this film with high hopes and it did not disappoint me. It has the usual Marvel humor but at the same time the seriousness as plot calls for it.

I'm not an emotional person and rarely cried watching a film but this one put tears into my eyes. It is by far one of the best superhero films.",10
Just perfect as expected!!,27 April 2019,,10
The cinematic universe model eats itself.,25 April 2019,"I remember ten years ago when I was a comic book fan and the whispers that were coming out about a Thanos Avengers movie blew my mind. Infinity War satisfied that desire greatly, but Endgame is a mixed bag. I came out of the cinema feeling rather underwhelmed.

To be sure, the action is superb. The last half hour of action made me grin from ear to ear and it gave me a similar feeling to watching Return of the King for the first time. However, it was a long road to get to that point.

The film is too long. Far too long. It carries far too much baggage from the last movie and drags its heels, which in turn creates a jarring tonal discordance from quipping-Marvel fun to apocalyptic moping. Stop telling me how important things are. I know. Show me why they're important.

Another problem I have is the story. It never felt like I was watching one. Infinity War was a hectic race against the clock, Endgame felt like I was watching a board meeting of writers and executives discussing how they're going to tie up loose ends. This is a movie that serves a cinematic universe owned by Disney, rather than serving to tell us a story.

Without discussing spoilers, the plot is far too convoluted. The all-powerful Infinity Gems created enough plotholes you have to ignore, but adding time travel to the mix compounds this even further. It would be fine if the movie just dismissed these plotholes, but it keeps harping on the precise mechanics of how the time travel works in the MCU over and over, forcing me to think about how it makes no sense over and over. I don't like thinking about plotholes but Endgame just kept reminding me of them. Combined with the length this makes a large amount of the movie rather a chore to sit through.

You must think I hate this movie after that, but I don't. The positives are the ones that come with the standard Marvel movie, funny writing, excellent music, effects, acting and likable characters. I'm certainly glad to have seen it, but unlike Infinity War, it wears out it's welcome after the first viewing.",6
Beyond EXPECTATION,4 May 2019,"I dont know how to say butThe movie just perfect, from the story,visual,acting,and the battle are just perfect, this is movie in generation, must watch quckly.",10
Not that good,25 April 2019,"First 2 hours are kind of dull. I was expecting more frankly. Reckon it's predictable as well, the last hour was entertaining though.",6
Epic fail,1 May 2019,None of the rules presented in movie makes sense. Bad movie in regards to final conclusion,1
A nearly perfect ending to an unprecedented movie-going journey,26 April 2019,"Avengers: End Game can't compete on its own against the likes of The Godfather, Citizen Kane, or The Dark Knight, but the Marvel Cinematic Universe has never been about competing on your own. The MCU parallels it's own characters in the sense that it's strength lies not in each individual, but rather the sum of their parts. Avengers: End Game is a thrilling and satisfying conclusion to the seemingly untouchable Infinity Saga, whose 10 year presence has changed cinema forever.",9
Less then expected,25 April 2019,"This was not the Grand Final i expected. It is just a Fan pleaser movie for the last Decade of MCU Films. I wanted to give it a seven, however I do understand why it was done this way, so it gets an eight. It was too much on feelings, to much slapstick ..anyway Homecoming is near to end phase 3 technically and I think it will be the better film overall.",8
A beautiful finale to a long running story arc,16 February 2020,"To be fair there has been a lot of build up story and character development movies to this, but what a payoff. Will there ever be such reward for the audience that has followed the journey? I find it hard to believe. If there ever is I hope to experience it in my lifetime.

With Infinity War to complement this main story-line, the audience is given an absolute treat. I am grateful to have followed this journey since 2008 and avoided all spoilers. Put simply, in my opinion, if you have seen all the preceding MCU movies, Infinity War and Endgame are the best action/superhero movies ever.",10
Best Marvel movie I've ever seen!,27 May 2019,So Avengers Endgame was the most epic Marvel movie I've ever seen it's a celebration of all the movies in the MCU leading up to Avengers Endgame and it was a walk down memory lane the entire movie and it's filled with references only people who have been around since the beginning will understand and get and yes it's 3 hours but every second of this movie is worth your time I've seen it now 3 times and still wanna see it AGAIN! I don't want to spoil anything but basically it's awesome!,10
Good but not 10/10,26 April 2019,"No spoilers here!

I'll keep it short and sweet, it's a solid film and I enjoyed it, but it's nothing we haven't seen before. Would I reccomend you go and see it? Of course! You should just keep your expectations within reason.",8
The best,21 July 2023,"Title: Avengers: Endgame - A Cinematic Triumph and the Best Movie of All Time

Avengers: Endgame has undoubtedly transcended the boundaries of cinematic excellence, redefining the very essence of blockbuster filmmaking. This epic masterpiece directed by the Russo brothers is more than just a movie; it's a breathtaking culmination of over a decade's worth of storytelling and character development within the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU).

From the very first frame, Endgame pulls its audience into a rollercoaster of emotions, taking them on a journey of hope, sacrifice, and redemption. The stakes have never been higher for Earth's mightiest heroes, and the film expertly balances heart-wrenching drama with exhilarating action sequences. Each scene is crafted with meticulous attention to detail, leaving no room for complacency.

What sets Endgame apart from other superhero flicks is its unwavering focus on the characters we've come to love throughout the MCU's extensive saga. It's not just about flashy CGI battles (though those are undeniably awe-inspiring); it's about the human elements, the vulnerability and camaraderie shared by the Avengers, making their victories and losses all the more meaningful.

The film's three-hour runtime flies by, a testament to its captivating narrative and the emotional investment audiences have made in the characters' arcs. Endgame skillfully ties together loose ends from previous films, providing fans with satisfying resolutions while managing to deliver several unexpected twists and surprises.

It's impossible to discuss Avengers: Endgame without applauding the extraordinary performances of its ensemble cast. Robert Downey Jr. As Tony Stark/Iron Man, Chris Evans as Steve Rogers/Captain America, Scarlett Johansson as Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow, and the rest of the cast deliver performances that are nothing short of exceptional. Their portrayals add depth and soul to the characters, making the audience empathize with every triumph and heartbreak.

The film's technical brilliance is equally impressive, with seamless visual effects and stunning cinematography that enhances the grandeur of each battle scene. Alan Silvestri's musical score tugs at heartstrings, elevating the emotional impact of every crucial moment.

Avengers: Endgame is not just a standalone film; it's a cultural phenomenon that has left an indelible mark on the film industry and popular culture. It's a cinematic event that unites fans from all walks of life, celebrating the power of storytelling and the joy of shared experiences.

In conclusion, Avengers: Endgame has set an unparalleled standard for superhero films and stands tall as the best movie of all time. Its profound impact on audiences, coupled with its technical brilliance and heartfelt performances, make it a timeless masterpiece that will be cherished for generations to come. A fitting and emotionally resonant conclusion to an era in cinema that will forever be remembered as a true cinematic triumph.",10
"Visually great, but not an overly thrilling or exciting movie...",30 July 2019,"Well, I finally got around to watching ""Avengers: Endgame"", even though I already watched ""Spider-Man: Far from Home"", so I already knew some of the events that were to transpire in ""Avengers: Endgame"". And I am not really fond of the superhero genre, but I still watch the movies when given the chance, as they are usually visually fantastic and provide adequate entertainment. And of course with all the hype that ""Avengers: Endgame"" had gotten, of course I just had to sit down and watch it.

First of all, the movie was long. A little bit too long actually. I did feel that directors Anthony Russo and Joe Russo were taking their sweet time getting to the core of the storyline, and just dancing around the bushes. In my opinion, the movie did suffer from this.

Visually, well let's just go with 'wow'. Yeah, the movie was phenomenally stunning to look at visually given the CGI and special effects. But of course, being a Marvel movie, then you'd have top of the line special effects. And it is the visuals that carry the superhero movies quite a long way down the road.

Story-wise, then I felt that the plot and storyline portrayed in ""Avengers: Endgame"" was a little bit too predictable and too generic. You already knew the movie's outcome when you sat down to watch it. Of course, Marvel weren't going to kill off a heap of their most beloved characters. No chance of that happening. So there weren't really much of any surprises along the way. And the time traveling aspect of the movie? Seriously? That was just downright idiotic.

What worked for the movie, aside from the great visuals, was the impressive ensemble of actors and actresses that made an appearance in bigger or smaller parts throughout the course of the movie. Thumbs up for that. However, I found some of the dialogue to be a bit too corny and felt that it was written for a young audience.

Was ""Avengers: Endgame"" a fulfilling closure to the Marvel storyline? Hardly so. The movie, while being entertaining enough, felt a bit shallow, with parts of the story quite poorly written. But if you, like me, come to the superhero movies mostly for the special effects, then ""Avengers: Endgame"" will definitely blow you away.

All in all, I am rating ""Avengers: Endgame"" a six out of ten stars.",6
An epic end to an epic saga,25 April 2019,This should be higher up the top 250! It was such a great surprise! I've never see anything like it!

Best movie ever,20 June 2019,,10
The best ending I could have asked for,15 February 2020,"Before seeing this movie I was super excited, but a little nervous. I had no idea how they were going to pull off wrapping up a franchise this big, but they nailed it! I don't think they could have done better with this movie. It was thoughtful, every main avenger had an important character arc to wrap up their story and the fan service was done perfectly. This movie made me appreciate some of the other MCU films that I didn't like as much, like Thor the Dark World. I was stunned at some of the little details that they remembered and brought full circle from the other films. All the characters endings made sense and were extremely satisfying. Also, the final battle was by far the best battle I've seen in any superhero movie. This was more than a film, this was an experience. I will never forget seeing this movie for the rest of my life. It's one of my favorite memories. I truly don't think the film industry can ever pull off a feat like this again.",10
NOT BAD,3 May 2019,"The film starts to fall apart the more you think about it, but the conclusion to so many wonderful decade-spanning character arcs are so incredibly satisfying. There's so much to like about this film.",7
Masterpiece...,21 January 2022,"""Avengers: Endgame"" is an Action - Drama movie in which we continue from were ""Avengers: Infinity War"" finished. The Avengers with the rest of their allies assemble to reverse what Thanos did and restore everything.

I have to admit that I was expecting this movie after watching the ""Avengers: Infinity War"" because I wanted to see what will happen next. So, I had high expectations by this movie and thankfully I was not disappointed at all by it. The direction which was made for one more time by Anthony Russo and Joe Russo was simply outstanding and they followed their successful pattern and way. For one more time the interpretations of the cast made the difference and their combination proved why was so successful through all those movies including ""Avengers: Endgame"". To sum up, I have to say that ""Avengers: Endgame"" is an amazing movie and I highly recommend everyone to watch it.",10
"To feel so desperately that you're right, yet to fail nonetheless...",27 April 2019,"To put it simply: One of THE most overrated films ever made.... I wanted it to be everything i'd hoped for, i wanted it to live up to the gargantuan hype, but unfortunately it falls short and in essence 'fails nonetheless' (to quote Thanos) The final fight was good, but again nothing more I do not wish to include spoilers so i'll say this: This was not EPIC Some people thought so

Great finale,7 July 2020,"This film is a great finale to the Marvel Cinematic Universe and it wraps up all of their prior threads. There are references to years and years of films but it all feels like it comes together very naturally. The use of time travel was pretty well handled and didn't get as messy as in other films. The story itself and the twists were very engaging. One of my main concerns is Captain Marvel, who is so powerful that the writers have to contrive excuses for her to be elsewhere. Otherwise she could just solve most of the problems at once.",8

The writing was perfect and well paced. You had your expected comedy from a Marvel Studios film, but man when it took a turn, you were in for the ride of your life. I laughed, I gasped, and yes, I cried...a few times. Real tears. So emotional. I'm not sure any range of films could have or ever will culminate in anything close to this. Kudos to the actors who we took this ride with over the last 10+ years and of course to the Russos.",10
The saga is complete,24 April 2019,"Starting many years agoe this saga began, on a journey of true extraordinary characters and storylines. Not all of them were great but they all held a beautiful story to a bigger story.

I can go on writing on all the wonderful and lovely parts of the film and maybe pick a bad place e here 'n there but it's not needed. This is a genuine and beautiful story on people we've had the joy of following for a decade. This is an emotional roller coaster that will brace every part of the viewer. If you're in this hero-worls then you owe it to the industry to see this movie. I did, I cried and I recommend you to see it as well, it's goddam amazing!

Thanks for everything Stan. With love, Rob.",10

"Somehow, the Russo Brothers pulled it off.",27 April 2019,"Bravo. Bravo! Somehow, one of the most hyped movies of this time has exceeded my (and many others') expectation. This movie leaves a beautiful bowtie on top of the gift that was the MCU. Unlike many other superhero universes, the MCU primarily focuses on character development over the abilities or powers of the heroes. This movie is no different. The first time I watched this movie, I was on the edge of my seat, crying, laughing, cheering, and throwing my hands in the air. No other movie has ever brought about this level of emotional response in me. Somehow, I was crying even harder the second time I watched it even though I already knew what happens....",10
Plot holes galore. Overrated.,28 April 2019,"The movie is plagued by plot holes. I will not go over all of them but I spent over an hour after the movie listing all the plot holes to my daughter. The biggest and the most ridiculous one is that the Avengers had only enough Pym particles for one round trip each. Movie made a big deal about this. But towards the end, Thanos uses one vial of Pym particle on his ship with everyone on board. With thousands of minion creatures on it. With no special ""Quantum"" suit or equipment. You mean to tell me Avengers could've just got on a vehicle and teleport all together with one vial? And with Hank Pym back now, they can time travel at will from now on. Or go back in time to get more just like they did in the movie. This completely ruins the Marvel Universe.

There also was a huge plot hole fail in The Last Jedi when Holdo sliced Snoke's mothership by going lightspeed. Which ruined the Star Wars Universe. And this rivals that plot hole. The Last Jedi was ruined by too many ridiculous plot holes.

Their version of time travel is a big mess too. It says past and future is not connected and changing past doesn't effect future but there are parts where it shows the new past effecting the future. And they were making fun of Back to the Future.",6
The worst Marvel film,27 April 2019,"I really liked all of previous Marvel films, but this one was a huuuge disappointment. More than half of the film was really boring, in fact nothing happened. Fight scenes looked like made by 10-year-old Marvel fan. All of the film seemed to be made out of fan theories and dad jokes. I'm sad because it's the end of this Marvel era and this wasn't the final I was expecting.",3
Best I have ever watched.,28 April 2019,"This is the best movie I have watched till now. I will rate it 10 out of 10. There was so much excitement so much surprise so much action and the last thing which broke heart, emotion. Only the real fan will understand how much it broke heart. But it was needed to get 10 out of 10. As it is spoiler free I can't tell anything more but one thing, I have watched the movie in hall print then think how will it be in 1080p blue-ray.

That end fight was just way too much, I was checking the time and ready for it to wrap up by then. My favorite heroes were under utilized.

It was a good ending to the infinity series. I'm not sure what I was expecting. I was just ready for it to be over by then.",8

And it ends with mastery, giving an epic end to a great circle that began in 2008. I recommend this movie to all who are fans of superheroes. Congratulations MARVEL, you got it.",10
Surprisingly Meh...,26 April 2019,"The most anticipated film of the year: Reviewing ""Avengers: Endgame"" (NO SPOILERS)

Saying this film gives fan service does not even begin to scratch the surface, as it is littered from beginning to end with quips. humor, forced appearances and minor characters. While being a send off to the old and an introduction to the new, this film was literally the end of the MCU as we know it, making me personally fear for the future of the franchise. It's not a bad film by any means, but it also fails to live up to the hype and emotion promised, although my screening was filled with thunderous applause, laughter, and literal sobbing at the end. Endgame is sort of a mess, and the story goes everywhere until finally reaching the climax. The film is split into three acts, all of which go entirely different directions, the first act is somber, yet humorous, for no reason at all. The second act is slightly confusing, but brilliant, bringing us back to different moments remembered throughout the MCU, and the third act is an all-out battle, not filmed particularly well. As far as films that wrap up a series go, with the 3-hour plus run-time, most of ""Endgame"" falls into the extremely average category, as more character growth should have been realized and the full potential of the original six Avengers, minus a couple, was never fully realized. Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, and Jeremy Renner stand out in their respective roles, where Scarlett Johanson, Mark Ruffalo, and Chris Hemsworth feel greatly under utilized. The more modern Avengers cast is fresh, for the most part, but we begin to see where the MCU has over-saturated the franchise itself, as some characters that are even in briefly are far too invincible for a Universe based in modern times. The conclusion of the film will bring tears to some, but it's the closing the original MCU deserves after 11 long years. See it in the theater. ""Infinity War"" was the superior film. 7.5/10",7
Truly a masterpiece.,1 September 2019,"Endgame is an amazing culmination of 11 years of Marvel movies, leading to an epic battle. The acting, CGI, and plot are on point. It was also great to have references from previous movies, showing that all of the MCU is connected.

I fully recommend, but do watch the previous movies to understand context, characters, and the story in general.",10

Lets get real,28 April 2019,,6
A flawed masterpiece 10 years in the making,24 April 2019,"Last year I watched Infinity War on opening day in theatres and was amazed by it. Of course it was flawed and those flaws did bother me but it was still incredible. I just watched Endgame and this film made Infinity War look like Thor: The Dark World.

Endgame is a stellar film, through its spectacular visuals, charming characters, epic fight scenes and engrossing narrative. It is a film that shouldn't be possible. If someone told me about this film ten years ago and said it was actually great, I would have laughed in their face. Yet somehow a film of this scale, ten years in the making, was masterfully executed. There was a lot I expected to happen that did but there was tons more I never thought would happen that completely caught me by surprise which is what I truly love about this film.

The first two acts were great, they drove the story forward and gave us some great character moments. The first scene in the film, gave me the first out of many tears that would shed throughout the film. Honestly I have never cried this much in a movie and I would have never thought this would be the film that would make me do that. However the first two acts were flawed, there were a few pacing issues here and there, some problems with the narrative in terms of developing some character moments and other issues.

However by the third act those problems were completely forgotten. The third act was so grand and epic and was one of the best final hours I have ever witnessed in a movie ever. I would love to talk about it but I am keeping things spoiler three. Just know that you could never imagine how effing spectacular it is. I certainly didn't.

The ending in particular was emotional, heartfelt and immensely engrossing. It was a well deserved pay-off to these last ten years of films and a great satisfying end to it all. Overall Avengers: Endgame is a film that not only surpassed my expectations, but is also a flawed masterpiece. To this day I would have never thought I would want to give a film this flawed an 11/10.",8

Avengers Endgame is truly an awesome and perfect finale for the past 22 movies in 11 years. The end to such a grand saga couldn't have been better. The movie is epic and out of the world. The hardwork of the cast and the whole crew can surely be seen in the movie. The audience wasn't expecting such an amazing ending to the infinity saga. The movie has perfect amount of action, comedy, emotion and the flashbacks and the references to the previous MCU movies truly culminated the 11 years journey. The end of the saga couldn't have been better.",10

We love you 3000!,30 April 2019,"Thanos (Josh Brolin) snapped his fingers while wearing the Infinity Gauntlet, and half of all life in the universe disappeared. That's how last year's Avengers: Infinity War ended and left us craving for its epic conclusion.

One year later, we are finally in the Endgame. The Russo Brothers filmed this arc of the Marvel Cinematic Universe back to back and reminds us of the ""snap"", as we sit down to witness what's coming. Unaware of the battle happening in Wakanda, a family is in for a surprise that will have some serious consequences. Not just for them, but for the entire universe that doesn't know how to move on.

The surviving Avengers - Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Captain America (Chris Evans), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), War Machine (Don Cheadle) plus brand new members Rocket (Bradley Cooper), Okoye (Danai Gurira) and marvellous Captain Marvel (Brie Larson) set off on a mission to stop Thanos once and for all. Will they find Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) and Nebula (Karen Gillan) in time to join them on this quest? And if so, what if it all fails in the end and make things even worse?

11 years and 21 films have been leading up to this chapter. Avengers: Endgame says farewell to characters that have been part of our lives for such a long time, tears are inevitable. Emotions will peak, because movie fans have sat in the backseat for such a long time and got to know these heroes as if we're part of the team. Plots will be wrapped up (even some continuity errors are being corrected, to make sure everything is correct). Everything is at stake and there is only one solution. This is it.

Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely's script knows just how to find that balance between science, drama and action. These guys know what they're doing and find the heart in the midst of all the heroism. The battle of Wakanda was just a warm up - you ain't seen nothing yet! The Avengers and all of their friends get enough screentime to be remembered with honour or to leave an everlasting mark on all of us. Our superheroes have some extra tricks up their sleeves to keep things exciting. Every one of them gets a moment to shine and the clash we witness in the third act of Endgame is one of the most perfectly constructed and visually mesmerising war scenes you will witness - maybe, EVER! There will be laughs, you will cheer and gasp and you will definitely cry.

After Endgame, there's a whole new saga to start and an entire universe to explore. But for now, let's just enjoy the finale to our Infinity Saga and take one last bow to salute them. Thank you Avengers. We love you 3000!",9

This movie blended all of the storylines into one arc beautifully. It has a perfect blend of drama and well timed comedic moments. Every character has a chance to shine and the cast delivered at every chance. It has a perfect ending. Of course the Disney/marvel machine will roll on. They are printing money at this point. But let's all take a while and appreciate the work of the entire team that made this happen for fans. I grew up wondering if I'd ever see this material on a big screen.

How i thought this movie should have unravelled....,5 May 2019,,1
We are in the Endgame now.,16 April 2020,"I wait this film without any patience. I hope that it would be one of the greatest film of MCU. My hope became the truth. In me point of view, this film is great from all aspects of cinema. Firstly, the story is amazing, the screenwriters did the great work, despite of 3 hours, no moments looks very long or boring. Twisted moments happen in the right place, most of actions of characters are logical. The authors have big attention to little details and ""easters"" due the film. Secondly, the cast is awesome, so many characters of comics together were the first time in the history. Some characters' lines ends, and this finish looks great (Iron Man and Captain America). Thirdly, the visual effects is wonderful. So, it's one of greatest oan biggest film ever.",10
Surely one of the best movie you'll ever watch only if you are invested in the MCU,27 April 2019,I cant talk much about this movie ...It was just too good,10
A Fan service.,27 April 2019,,10
I just have one question! Spoiler alert!!!!,30 April 2019,,10
WOWWW. Just WOW!!!!,26 April 2019,"Avengers Endgame is the culmination of 21 Marvel movies over 11 years and there can not be a better ending than this. What a befitting end to an incredible journey. The Dark Knight was the best comic movie ever made but now Endgame shares the top spot with it and it definitely deserves it.

The Russo's have upped the ante with their last outing, Infinity War and raised the bar for this so high. Boy did they do it better this time. The writing, directing and acting is incredible. With so many characters and superheroes, each one of them gets a chance to shine which is not an easy feat but the writers managed to do it.

This is a 3 hour long movie but I didn't feel bored for a second. Such was the writing and direction. It has drama, humour, emotions, kinetic action and visual extravaganza. No spoilers, but towards the end of the movie all the super heroes from MCU come together and it is an absolute heart-stopping moment when Captain America says ""Avengers assemble"".

The movie is going to leave you laughing, surprised and shocking by some twists, posibbly gasping and screaming. The ending is gonna make you emotional but you will leave the theater with a satisfying smile.

Kudos to the Russo's, writers, Kevin Fiege and the entire Marvel team for this. Just go watch the movie and you will not be disappointed.",10
Marvel Superheroes,28 April 2019,They should include the X-Men in their next movie.,10
Not better than Infinity War :(,27 April 2019,"I want to give it 7/10 but +1 just for the potential of film makers who could present this conclusion.

IW was just too perfect. Endgame must have been on the top of it, but sadly it is not.

Despite of the difficulty to continue with the storyline after thanos' snap, this end is satisfactory.

I think film makers should have taken one more part of Avengers to bring down the conclusion. This way they could bring more action to it.",7

Marvel's best ever,24 April 2019,"This was the best adieu to last 11 years of marvel. It was emotional, i can still feel the gossebumps. It had its own flaws and I didn't get 1 or 2 answers i was looking in this movie but in the end I was satisfied, the second half went on another level and some set pieces will be remembered for years to come. Once in a decade a movie in this genre comes who defines the genre, the previous 10 years was The Dark Knight from this year onwards it would be Endgame.",10
An homage for the end of the longest saga in film history,24 April 2019,"It's absolutely ridiculous how this movie comes close to perfection. Considering the characters' story lines and how much this film does for fans of the franchise, it's truly a masterpiece.",10
An emotional roller coaster,24 April 2019,"God damn I laughed and I cried and I laughed and I cried, now I'm watching it for the second time, probably the third, I can't even remember how many times....",10
A Good Endgame,27 April 2019,,10
Very good but disappointing,27 April 2019,"In many ways what this film does is to be respected, yet many of its scenes are also messy and get to be too convoluted.",
Best film ever,21 May 2019,"End game is a culmination of over a decade of films and Marvel pulled it off better than any production company before them. The full cast were all second to none, the script was very well thought out and the action gave us all if not most, exactly why we had hoped for. There are sad moments, funny lines, dramatic build ups and the to trained eye, a closure to a lot of stories spanning from many fans would have even been born. Personally I've watched the film 6 times now and love it every time.",10
Whole film is not worth to watch because of first half,5 May 2019,,6
Smooth landing to an amazing 11 year ride,26 April 2019,"This is made by people who do, for people who do, and this movie itself, does, love the MCU. You can think of it as a TV show finale. After 21 episodes that are all feature length. And before you can even say ""oh no those are all terrible"", this immediately proves itself to be an exception to that rule. Where the equally masterful Infinity War was almost one long action climax, this is less about fights. Which doesn't mean it doesn't have any. Or that they're anything less than excellent. And this film is definitely never boring. This focuses on character exploration. Every member of the original Avengers team, and a handful individuals that aren't, all get significant depth. I remain one of the few people who argue that Age of Ultron did deliver that, albeit in small concentrated format. This easily tops that. Everyone is pushed into a situation new to them. The trailers hint at some of these, whilst leaving others as incredible surprises. Make sure you avoid spoilers before watching this.

This picture moves fast and packs a lot into its not quite lean running time. In other words, it's directed by the Russo Brothers. The length is justified. I wouldn't cut anything from this. The emotional moments don't feel sappy. The countless callbacks and references don't feel like they're just there to make you feel good for paying attention to all that lead to this one. The acting shows just how well all of these performers understand the characters. And the screenplay does the same for the writers. The effects are astonishing, yet again getting us to care about individuals that we know are all CG. It uses the varied skills, equipment and the like, of the unique heroes and villains, creatively. This delivers deeply satisfying closure. It truly is a conclusion. It's not trying to get you back to the theatre for the next adventure. The few currently confirmed entries into this franchise don't need hyping, anyway. Spider-Man with Mysterio? Another Black Panther story? The unfairly fired James Gunn returning to round out the trilogy of the Guardians of the Galaxy? Solo Black widow, *finally*? More Dr Strange? Shang-Chi, The Eternals, Blade? Keep 'em coming.

I recommend this to everyone who's taken this entire journey. And if you're someone who's skipped some, or held off on this series up to this point, this is an excellent reason to address that. Unless they're simply not to your liking. This is not going to change that. It's not meant to. 10/10",10
"For me, this was a breakup after a 11-year-old marriage with the MCU",16 May 2019,"I have a strong sentimental attachment for the MCU. I watched the movies for 11 years, and this was almost like a breakup for me. Infinity War was one of my best movie experiences, i was beyond shocked, exited and emotional. And happy, beacause no movie of the mcu has accomplished that in me, and was because the bad guy wins (happy endings got boring honestly), all those uncomfortable one-line jokes and witty remarks were few, all the encounters and character development were meaningful and wonderful set, and the battles, my god, the battles were so epic, so imginative and so so great. all of what this movies lacks. it´s 3hrs of pure emotion, with a bad written story and not particularly appealing visuals. It seems as if they went with the first draft of the scrpit. i can´t understand all the glory this movie gets. I feel very ripped off",6
Perhaps The Best Comic Book Movie Ever Made...!,24 April 2019,"So i got the chance to see this movie earlier today in Warsaw,Poland. Now I know my title might be arguable to most people but for me and alot of the fans who have been invested in this for the last 10 years, this is no understating the fact that it is the best comicbook/superhero event ever! And possibly for a long long time we won't be seeing anything close to this.

I won't say anything about the movie because i dont want to spoil the Endgame for you!

This movie is everything and beyond what we could have expected it to be! it does more than that and it has that satisfying end we all wanted!

I write this review today as a proud and emotional fan who is satisfied to see these 10-11 years being paid off!",10
Just Amazing,27 April 2019,This was a very well written movie. I had my own theory on what I thought was going to happen but was proven wrong. It's definitely an emotional rollercoaster. Enjoy!,10
The best Marvel film by far!!! Excelsior!!,24 April 2019,"Well it's been a hell of a wait since Infinity War, but the Russo Brothers have delivered in spectacular style and quality.

I loved this film in all its entirety and encourage everyone who goes see it to do a toilet check before the titles roll.

It is an immense roller-coaster with many twists and turns.

The studio keeps getting better and I hope it continues for years to come. Don't be dissuaded by the feature length of just over 3 hours, this is a MARVELlous spectacle for all to see!

Make mine Marvel True Believers!! Full marks.",10
An absolute MASTERPIECE!,29 April 2019,It couldnt be better than this. I enjoyed every second of this cinematography icon.,10
heres why this world needed this movie,24 April 2019,"In a world where power means greed and the ability to destroy as opposed to protect and build. In a world where we tend to categorize and create tension as opposed to finding common good. Why shouldn't we believe in super heroes and the ability to overcome evil through seeking common good, unity and sacrifice. Script was excellent, performance was mind blowing ...Marvel Magic hit home! Everyone was clapping 👏🏼 Standing ovation as the credits rolled I can watch this over and over and over again!!!!! Mind blowing!!!!!!",10
Perfection - anything less than 10 is ridiculous,24 April 2019,Honestly the best movie and cinematic experience ever. This is a perfect send off and anyone scoring it less than 10 is just trying to be controversial.,10

Snooze....,15 May 2019,"My kids were very excited to see this but I was more apprehensive. Really, the film is far too long, just unnecessarily. Parts of this film were very boring and were an ideal time for a cinema snooze! It had so much more potential but directors lost site of their aim. Disappointed.",2
Simply the best movie ever,6 August 2019,"I never have seen any movie in life that has such a great action and awesome fantasy , I am speechless and all I can say is bravo and will done.",10
Avengers: Endgame was a great way to end the first series of the Marvel Cinematic Univeerse,16 May 2019,"If you've watched a lot of these Marvel Cinematic Universe movies-as I have-than you probably laughed, was thrilled, and was ultimately touched by this-the pretty much final chapter of this run of the series which began with Iron Man back in '08. The fate of him as well as Captain America and a few others were great epilogues for them. Oh, and one final cameo by Marvel Comics' late creator of many of the company's popular superheroes-Stan Lee-makes it even more poignant. So to quote him, ""Excelsior!""",10
Avengers: Endgame,6 May 2019,,9
Marvel has done it again!!,27 April 2019,"I absolutely love this movie! This film totally blew me away with such a remarkable story! To those not so true believers of marvel who thinks this film is not worth the money and say that it's not the greatest film ever. YOU SUCK! As a filmmaker I really appreciate what the Russo brothers did! Thank you Russo brothers for another great Marvel film! And god bless Stan Lee, Jack Kirby, and Steve Ditko for creating such remarkable characters that has touched my heart!",10

AMAZING!,24 April 2019,"Some of theories that you've seen online, happens, but not really. All I can say is they done a great job and there was the epic moment, which is my favorite scene. This movie will make you laugh, happy, amaze, and having a mental breakdown at the same time.",10
We are back to classic action film,29 April 2019,"It wasn't bad, bu it's a simple action cliche, with humor, without drama or deep message. What special about infinity war, is the conflict. The villain is not all evil. He wants to create a better world for everyone to thrive. Infinity war ends with a dissonance, and many viewers, me included asked themselves - maybe he is right. Endgame starts with a simple answer - the world is a mess after Thanos actions. I think the world can thrive even with half of the population, but here right from the beginning the answer is simple. Endgame switched from the attempt to make the bad guy have deep character, into a clear message: ""Thanos is all bad"". Well this message continues through the entire movie, and I hate the fact they ruined the deep complex villain character, with a ""want to destroy all, including his comrades "" boring villain.",6
It looks great but very plastic and no real content and the story is bad,12 May 2019,,2
"The best Marvel, including all the non MCU ones, ever.",30 April 2019,Best movie ever. Nonstop since the first second. I just watched it 2 hours ago and I'm still shaken and wired up about it. Definitely going to watch it again.,10

Best Movie EVER!!,30 April 2019,,10
We've been cheated!!!!,25 April 2019,"Disney knew it was going to make a ton of money from this sequel and so it feels like everyone involved in its production, from directors, writers and actors etc. just didn't bother turning up - aside from collecting their pay cheque. Anyone with a reasonable amount of intelligence and maturity will know the movie undelivered massively. Perhaps trying to weave characters in and out of previous movies took their eye off the quality of the offering. For those who have rated it a 10, once their excitement from all the anticipation dwindles, reality will sobering. Shame all the previous quality, especially infinity, has this movie associated. I should've known something was amiss when cpt marvel turned out to ba a total waste of time. MCU Phase 4...? You can shove that up your....!",7

"World was waiting, and world has been served",24 April 2019,"Lucky to have watched it in the very first preview, not going to be spoiling things, but people you are witnessing a conclusion of 22 Movies, you can't be fair enough while Judging, unless you have seen the efforts of 10 years of Experience in making best stories to best movies, believe that or not, if you saw the rest movies and have an idea of what every character represents you will deeply appreciate that movie, and easily say it worth 15/10, so many sacrifices, so many happiness, joy and laughter, best cinema experience among all competitors, finally gotta say, MCU rocks all the way, after a low hit in Captain Marvel, they hit back in a way to blow your mind Planet Earth, enjoy the peace of art",9

"Big, funny, entertaining and sad for those who are invested into this series",25 April 2019,"Greetings from Lithuania.

""Avengers: Endgame"" (2019) was funny, a bit sad, very entertaining, spectacular and maybe a bit too long for me personally. I did enjoy this movie from start till finish though, and while its not my personal favorite from them all, this was a very solid movie in my opinion (and i'm not a huge fan of these movies to start with, so tears haven't been found during my watch).

Overall, ""Avengers: Endgame"" brings half of the Hollywood famous actors into one big, entertaining 3 hours (!) long escapism. At the end i enjoyed this film much more then i thought i will be.",9
The best marvel film to date,7 August 2019,What do I say this movie in incredible I started watching marvel movies around when the first avengers movie came out ever sense I seen everyone of them,10

I cried...,7 August 2019,"Omg, marvel smashed it with his one, such a great ending even tho I cried and hated it in my heart (lol), buf after a bit of time and understanding the impact it had. It was for the best. Hope to see the greatest character come back some day or get his own movie.",10
Ending the MCU infinity age,25 April 2019,,6
Boring,11 May 2019,"This has to be one of the most overrated films I've ever seen, it was long boring and tiring to watch. The story was boring slow and at times just felt unnecessary. I genuinely don't understand how people can say it was a 10/10 film.",3
What 1-star Reviewers Have In Common and Don't Understand,19 July 2021,"I've seen many reviewers on here bashing this movie for a lot of reasons. Logic Flaws, Dialogue, too long and drawn out, or simply that it lacks emotion because it's isn't non-fiction. These are the same people who would bash the movie for being too rushed or for the opposite of what I described above. They fail to understand that we don't go to movies to watch non-fiction, but to be entertained; and the duo of Infinity War and Endgame is as entertaining as it gets.

Without giving any spoilers away, let me just say that when I saw this movie it was a completely full theater. The entire audience applauded 3 times and there was even one scene (you'll know it when you see it) where they all stood up to clap and cheer. Never in my years and years of moviegoing have I ever seen that happen and this is coming from someone who goes to movies every weekend. This is what happened so you be the judge as to whether all these one-star terrorists deserve the attention they get.

Like the first part of the story, it has moments that will blow your mind, break your heart, make you laugh, and shatter your soul, occasionally in the same scene. Never in my life have I seen a fictional universe so carefully crafted to the point where I am made to care for every character and where emotions are raging throughout in so many different ways. Given that there are over 60 of these characters, that is very difficult to pull off and this movie did it.

These two movies are an experience like no other and is one for the ages.",10
Spectacular finale to a great long franchise of MCU films.,27 April 2019,"Avengers: Endgame (5 out of 5 stars).

Avengers: Endgame is a magnificent awesome superhero film that concludes the infinity stones storyline that has been building up with 22 movies in the Marvel universe. They had done a great job building up each solo character and have there films bring something new and exciting. Endgame is the game changer that delivers the ultimate climax of the story arc with the big bad Thanos (Josh Brolin) going up against the Avengers. After the previous film Infinity War leaving the audience hanging with the cliffhanger. Marvel has done a great job in marketing and keeping this film spoilers free with the trailers that only show the same footage and very minimum. Which I will say it is best to see the film knowing very little about what is going to happen.

I will try to keep this review spoiler free. Endgame is amazing and spectacular. Joe and Anthony Russo direction was fantastic and they did a great job in delivering a spectacular climax of the MCU. The plot was amazing. For a three hour long film. The film does move pretty fast and kind of feels short when watching it. I did feel like Endgame is a little short on the action set pieces like the previous films. Which this film does focus more on the emotional connections with the original Avengers like Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Captain America (Chris Evans), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), and Clint Barton (Jeremy Renner) and how they were all affected by the aftermath of Infinity War. The film does have a lot of fun and feels like a wild adventure with what these characters go through. The final hour delivers all out with an epic climax which every character has a moment to shine. And makes up for the lack of action in the movie. I love how every hero works with another when fighting there enemy. There were some moments where you will be in an awe and clapping moment with the climatic battle sequence. The visual effects are top notch great. There is some fun humor that will lighten the mood of the film. And there are some tear jerking moments that will leave you feeling happy and sad at the same time. The directors did a wonderful job in surprising the audience with something new and reaching every characters full potential. The climatic fight scene with Thor, Cap America, and Iron Man teaming up and bouncing around with there super powers are just awesome. The surprises do keep on coming throughout. Which will leave you feeling satisfied.

Overall, Avengers: Endgame is a great and awesome superhero film. It is one of the best finales that Joe and Anthony Russo have delivered. The plot was amazing and fast moving. The direction focuses more on the emotional side of the characters and story. While delivering an epic climatic showdown that will have you grasping and excited. The cast ensemble was great. I will say this is one fun wild ride that I am happy how it ties the story arc together.",10
A masterpiece,10 August 2019,"Forget people who say that this movie is crap,because the way I see it avengers endgame is the most entertaining movie in history so far.",9
The best friction movie,31 July 2019,"I just love this movie. Specially the climax, seriously one of the best climax I have ever seen.",10
It will be a Historical One...,20 August 2019,"The film claimed to be super duper buster blockbuster hit after the movie Infinity War, and kept that promise also. Some Critics and Peoples said that the Movie is Overrated, but I can say clearly that they will definitely be DCEU fans who are saying like that for Endgame. They are just trying to undercast the grossing collection of worldwide. Anyway, The movie is for those people who saw MCU last 22 films and awaited for the conclusion as the twist was Thanos in their every movie. Feeling Sad for RDJ... 😭😭😭",10
So much in one movie,20 August 2019,"To all the haters, sit and think about the sheer amount of story, fan service, fun, epicness and sadness that tge managed to pack into 3 hours. The Russo bros had to tie up 22 movies and that is impossible, yet they pretty much pulled it off, anyone who says the price of admission wasn't worth it just for the Captain America scenes alone may as well stop watching movies. This is a tough act to follow, and a far more worthy record holder than the blue alien pocahontas rip off ever was. Keep it up Marvel, we are eagerly waiting for the next 10 years of amazing stories.",10
Not That great as its hyped,25 April 2019,Great movie But not better then infinity war. Ending was the best part of it,7

But the emotional roller coaster was just what I needed. It was hard to say good bye to certain characters but Plenty of doors were left open as we move into phase 4. I hope everyone enjoys it as much as I did. I won't post much more than this so I don't ruin the movie for anyone.,10

The Most Grandeur Piece of Motion Picture Created By Man,20 January 2024,"Wow.

Just wow.

Be glad that this movie is 3 hours, because I wish it was 4. After Avengers: Infinity War, I thought it couldn't get any better. Endgame did so, and then some. Featuring the greatest ensemble cast to date, Endgame gives every character their storyline until they meet up in the greatest battle in the history of television. The first hour-ish was extremely emotional and saddening, the next hour is thrilling/stressful, and the last hour not only features the fight I mentioned above, but also a 3-on-1 vs Thanos that felt like your favorite sports team was in overtime in the national championships. Everyone who wants to see Avengers: Endgame probably has, but if somehow you haven't, do yourself a favor and watch it ASAP.",10

Things I like (nothing particularly spoilery),24 April 2019,"It treated the audience as savvy enough to not have to over-explain problems related to their heroes endgame strategy; as a shorthand they just referred to a few movies enshrined in popular culture

The climactic action scenes ticked all the boxes for a good fight: The Shine, the Cut-off, the Hope, the Double-down, and the Finish. There were literal cheers from the audience I was in during The Hope

Callbacks to previous movies: Proof that Tony Stark has a heart, Kill Mode Activated, the Elevator scene (and its surprising resolution)

Iconic shots uplifted from the comics (the ""farmer's"" scarecrow)

Completed character arcs stay completed

Only the final 40 minutes were enjoyable,16 October 2020,"Let me get this straight, this movie is totally overhyped and I don't recommend wasting the 2 hours of your precious life just for an enjoyable last 40 minutes of the final battle. Even the final battle wasn't up to the mark, after an unimaginablely awesome portal scene we get 10 minutes of entire 10 years of MCU just punching, that's it which suddenly ends by sacrifice of iron man, and marvel even wasted a character like Spiderman. And did the death of black widow had any influence, I don't think so, an awesome character who ended up as a glamor in the movies. Overall this movie is a no go, if you want to watch it, go for the last 40 minutes, the rest is crap.",8

Extremely Ambitious,8 May 2019,"I've never been a super fan of Superhero movies. Having said that have seen most of the marvel films. The one takeaway from Avengers Endgame is that it is an extremely ambitious piece of film making. It's unusual that so many of the actors and artists who many people have come to idolize over the years should come together in a film.

The film starts five years after Infinity Wars ended. Not going to include any spoilers, but there's a good part of the opening half of the film spent looking into the devastating consequences of Infinity Wars which are very script/character driven. Not surprisingly the second half of the film is very much action based and the 3 hours running time fairly fizzes along. Although it isn't perfect Endgame is definitely one of the best Superhero movies I've watched and lived up to expectations.",6
"Predictable, boring and sometimes, cringeworthy",12 May 2019,"Endgame is such a bad conclusion for the epic Avengers saga. Everything sounds predictable and even boring, as the firsr 2 hours of movie is a non-sense fanservice for HQ readers. All the hype the movie had relied only on Marvel franchise, because the movie, at best, is mediocre, even compared to the previous one. There are a few cringeworthy momments to take note: ""professor"" Hulk 4th wallish jokes, the time travel machine itself, fat drunk Thunder God Thor and the worst one: ""She's not alone"" empowered heroines against the purple male patriarch. Unless you are a fanboy or fangirl, watching this will be 3 hours less in your lifespam.",4
Great movie,27 May 2019,"This was a great movie and a proper end to the series.

IT WAS AMAZING,12 May 2019,"Avengers endgame was in my opinion the best marvel movie to date. It was funny it was sad it had amazing action and amazing dialogue. I also liked how Thanos wasn't in it that much because he was the main character in infinity war. Thanos had 29 minutes, Ironman had 19 and captain America had about 14 in infinity war.

Not as amazing as all these 10 star reveiws claim,28 April 2019,"Avengers endgame had very little story progress through the 3 hr run it had and it created so many plot-holes along the way.

Time travel is a very tricky story element to implement into your franchise it can make or break the franchise. They even touch base on some of the flaws within the movie yet still happen to create said flaws making the end product into a paradox of itself. I can delve deeper into that but I would risk spoiling the movie.

Aside from the paradox they created they didn't utilize Captain Marvel like they should have. In fact she was used more like a one trick pony recreating her final moments in her own movie and recycling it over to the finale of this movie. She was more of a cameo if anything.

They had some great moments but those were few and far between. In fact within those 3 hours I can only remember maybe 3 to 4 minutes of quality scenes (not including any trailer footage) which makes these 3 hours drag.

So for the final Avengers movie with some of these characters it was a bit disappointing. Definitely not the best marvel superhero movie ever nor an epic conclusion like some claim. Honestly the Captain Marvel movie was more enjoyable and that's not really that great. 6.5/10 for me",6

"Meh. Pretty good, but not even in Top 10 of MCU",29 April 2019,"There is spectacle, although like a lot of massive CGI battles, you can't figure out what the hell is going on (Frankly, Hawkeye's sword fight with another human might have been the most coherent fight). There are SOME tender moments that work (and others that don't). There were lots of funny moments, usually provided by Thor.

All in all, a capable action flick. But, it could have been so much more, if they'd gone full nerd. Why do I say that? Because nerds would have got ""power"" situation right. The heroes powers fluctuate so greatly between movies, and even within the movie that it could drive a purist mad. There is nothing wrong with fantasy movies (e.g. sci-fi, space, Hobbit, etc.), but the worlds need to be internally consistent to be fun. Also, the ""cavalry charge"" at the end of all these movies is getting tiresome. (But, I get the ""nick of time"" stuff generically pumps up the ""dramatic tension.""...a little)

Anyway, it isn't top 10 of the MCU, but it's probably top 15. I'd still probably see Deadpool over and over again, rather than continue to see these middling, mass produced, corporate exercises. Like Star Wars the early years with Lucas instead of Disney. These corporate movies will never endanger the golden goose, or do anything surprising.",6

Amazing watch!!,27 April 2019,"This isn't so much a movie as an experience. And the homework needed to fully appreciate this is daunting for the most dedicated fans. But the pay-off for sticking with the MCU for 11 years and 22 movies is nothing short of spectacular. So many shocking developments, awesome moments and tear jerking scenes that even the most critical, cynical moviegoers will just be beaten into thoroughly enjoying this movie. There will never be another cinematic moment like this.",9
HONEST SHORT REVIEW FROM A MCU FAN,27 April 2019,"Endgame is too long. Why is that a problem? Because the length prevents the film from truly soaring to the heights achieved by Infinity War. I love the MCU and was as geeked out as anyone for Endgame, but I have to be honest. So here we go.....

The movie is largely built around the original 6 Avengers and that's fine to set up the film, however, Endgame takes a VERY long time to get any real momentum. A VERY long time. It isn't until Ant Man arrives that any life is injected into the film. So here are a few let downs in my opinion...

1. Captain Marvel is little more than a cardboard cutout and the personality she expressed in her movie is nowhere to be found. 2. You will be very disappointed if you enjoy seeing ""Hulk Smash!"" 3. You will be very disappointed if you hope to see much of Black Panther, Loki, Bucky, Nick Fury, Groot, or Gomorrah. 4. The film rarely lets loose the personalities we've all come to enjoy in Rocket, Star Lord, Happy, or even Captain Marvel for that matter.

Now for some positives:

1. There are some very good laughs that thankfully lift up the long run time. 2. Its a blast revisiting some moments from past MCU films. 3. It's nice to see the female empowerment themes and the potential set up for the Young Avengers 4. You can go to the restroom without missing something truly crucial. Seriously.

Overall: Endgame is 30 minutes too long and this prevents the film from achieving a solid and consistent pace. It allows moments where we have to think about the ""science"" behind the action. The emotional highs and lows are simply not as impactful as Infinity War and some serious stuff happens in Endgame. The climax is enjoyable, however we have waited over 2 hours to see if our favorite characters from the extended MCU are going to appear and by this time the climax has to be compressed into a 45 minute ""epic"" battle that is barely on par with the battle of Infinity War.

In short, Endgame is inferior to Infinity War. I should have felt deep sadness at times throughout the film and the movie was unable to create that feeling in me. I wanted to feel the same highs I felt with Infinity War, but those highs were few and fleeting.

It wraps the Avengers MCU in a beautiful box, but when opened, I was underwhelmed. I got my money's worth in sheer length, but that running time was detrimental to my ability to deeply invest.

"I LOVE YOU 3,000, MARVEL!",12 May 2019,"The Russos couldn't have subverted our expectations in a better way. Simply, because they didn't give a hoot about our expectations. Instead, they gave us a a continuation of Infinity War with a most unexpected conflict. In other words, they went for the head; all we cared about are the stones.

They also proved that they understand every character in this universe better than anyone. They delved into their minds and hearts in a way fans ever hoped and fancied. They truly fleshed out our beloved avengers by showing them as more humans exactly as we felt about them at every important moment in every movie in the MCU. They convinced us that these characters really experienced these moments, and thus cared about them as much as we do. The incredible cast, who are at the top of their game, couldn't have complemented what the Russos did for their characters more perfectly.

Whilst the unique storytelling of Infinity War never feels ""cinematic"", I absolutely loved it with its epic quality and how I felt that I was flipping pages of a graphic novel instead of watching a movie. The Russos used once again the same exceptional style of narration here, except that, to my surprise, it feels as ""cinematic"" as it gets! I have absolutely no clue how they have managed to do such a thing, but what I know is that this made me realize that Infinity War is flawed, especially in this aspect, way more than I thought. Everything here works twice as good as it did in Infinity War: comedy and drama. Also, this made the fast pacing don't come at the expense of the cohesiveness of the story.

The movie did make it a bit easy for itself sometimes (and we can see that in certain decisions that some character took, and a couple of things that are quite perfunctory that they could have gone deeper with), but the movie also took three thousand risks that entangled itself in what could have an endless loop of nonsensical chaos only to serve the franchise's fans, and it did as good as it gets.

Avengers: Paradox,25 April 2019,"I had to think on my rating and review quite carefully for this film, as the final part of the movie elevates it from the rest of it.

If I had to summarize this movie in one word it would be ""convoluted"". They take a sci-fi trope that always causes problems due to logic issues and went full steam ahead with it. The first two hours of the movie were quite unexpected, and by that I mean underwhelming, for the final movie in a decade long storyline.

The movie comes into its own and gives the fanbase geekgasms about 20 minutes to the end, but it wasn't enough in my opinion. I have rated it a 7 as I truly enjoyed the way it concluded.

There were a couple of scenes that made me laugh, but if as I wrote earlier, the final 20 - 30 minutes of Endgame are better than the previous 2 and a half hours of it, as there are too many flaws in logic and even the directors and screenwriters are not on the same page in their interviews as to how things are supposed to work.

I won't bother with a suggestion of should you go see it or not, but unless you are truly blinded by love for the franchise, don't expect a masterpiece or the best film from Marvel so far.",7
Super anna tq TQ this is the best movie in Marvel,28 April 2019,Super anna tq so much This is the best movie in Marvel,10
Emotional. Yet the overhype was unnecessary,1 May 2019,"I was ecstatic-- So ecstatic to see this film. But after just watching it. Honestly I don't know what to feel...

The first 2+ hours was a snail's pace. I felt there were too much unnecessary dialogues. And being true to heart of watching all the Marvel movies, this one made me yawn at least 3 times.

The ""good stuff"" only came towards the last hour. But even then the action sequences wasn't THAT great in comparison to Infinity War. It was a brief good entertainment to say the least...

I believed the writers were trying to make it more of a sentimental kind of superhero movie instead. Which, don't get me wrong, it's a nice approach. As there were some touching moments and it can definitely bring out the tears (mostly likely affecting the sensitive folk) ... I just felt it was a tad bit much (emotion > action). Maybe a nice balance of emotion and action would do be more suiting, as I've always felt this ""balance"" in the previous Avenger movies.

All-in-all, it was still a good movie. Not that great as typically people would expect (from the overhype and all). The ending was a real nice touch to the franchise. Now THAT brought on the water-works. Salute to that!

So thank you--- thank you to all those who've worked on Endgame. I believed you tried your very best and though it didn't satisfied me fully. It still left others happy, overall. So people, do give it a watch. As there's still some worth in it. *Salutes*",6
Way to long,19 August 2019,Way to long of a movie probably could of cut an hour out of it and it wouldn't have made a difference. Probably one of the worst Avenger movies I've seen. Very slow to get to the point and it do not hold my interest or my husband's.,3

OK conclusion but not spectacular...(a pretty much spoiler free review),3 May 2019,"Avengers : End Game was way too long. They could have wrapped up this story in 1hr 30min instead of stretching it out to 3hr. If you are less than a rabid fan I would recommend that you see this film at home. The crowd in my theater was attentive but strangely quiet and I didn't get much of a sense of excitement from the audience. Black Widow and Hawkeye had the best stories in this film and Ironman second. Ant man showed up and was fun and Rocket (the trash panda) represented the Guardians of the Galaxy (I'm a big Rocket fan 😊). I did not care for the Thor bit. I was disappointed with how they handled Thor's character - it just wasn't funny. The other Marvel characters showed up but the directors could have just set up cardboard cutouts and had voiceovers for all they contributed to the story line. It does not work as a stand-alone film - you have to have seen the previous films to understand it. I made my poor sister go to the movie with me (she had not seen all the previous films) and she felt tortured and bored (her words). She said that I now owe her ""big time"" Sheesh...",6

Avengers: Endgame - a love letter to all Marvel fans that comes straight from the heart,15 June 2020,"And so it arrives, the culmination of nearly 11 years, 3 phases, and 21 movies, (or almost 41 hours of storytelling), Avengers: Endgame is finally upon us. And for fans that have invested their time (and money) in the Marvel Cinematic Universe over the past decade or more it is hard to see how you could be less than blown away by the epic 3 hour finale delivered by the Russo Brothers.

The fan-service paid in film 22 of an incredible cinematic arc is off the charts. Which sadly means if you are coming in to Endgame with a limited knowledge of all that has gone before then your experience of this latest MCU entry will be a much poorer one for it.

That is not to say if you are brand new to this universe you wont enjoy Endgame. There is LOTS to enjoy even if you don't know your Stormbreaker from your Mjölnir. But it is worth investing some time to get to know the background to this closing chapter.

If you have lived through the Battle of New York, galaxy saving dance-offs, the rise of the Dark Elves, the fall of SHIELD, adventures in the quantum realm, and lack of Starbucks in Wakanda, then you are surely in for a roller coaster ride full of many emotional highs and some deeply crushing lows.

It is almost impossible for me to talk about my personal favourite moments from the film without dropping spoilers. And this is an event that you really don't want spoiled for you going in. The goosebumps, the adrenaline surges, the punches to the gut in some of the rawest MCU moments to date; no one deserves to take those feelings away from you. Aside from the beauty and majesty of many of the scenes, (not least the climatic showdown), this movie has an energy that injects directly in to the veins. With that in mind I will talk about those specific heart pounding, tear duct swelling beats another time.

While the Russo Brothers will invariably receive all the plaudits for Infinity War and Endgame, the contribution of writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely should not be overlooked. They have crafted an incredible story over these last two instalments encapsulating everything that has gone before with near precision. While the expectation in the action stakes was always high, and boy oh boy the action does not disappoint at all, there was always the risk that sentiment would be laid on in heavy doses. Thankfully that is not the case which is a testament to the wonderful writing of Markus and McFeely. It is a script that intertwines the complexities of the story while hitting the right notes in the right spots, especially the comedy and lighter moments which are plentiful.

Endgame is not without its faults, few and minor as they are. Pacing is occasionally a little off, entirely due to some over cooked exposition of major plot points. But in the grand scheme of things these are nothing more than quibbles and entirely forgivable.

While Endgame may not be the greatest, most flawless movie ever made, it is certainly up there with the best of all the Marvel movies to date. Perhaps even among the best of the superhero genre.

There is one scene I do have to mention that annoyed me a little. Some are already referring to it as the ""girl power"" moment. While it was incredible to see all of the female MCU protagonists on screen at the same time, the moment for me felt incredibly forced! It was almost like someone at the last minute said, ""Hey, you know what will be really cool?"", and they shoehorned in this ""moment"". For me it deserved better than the after thought it felt like it was and will stand out for, perhaps, all the wrong reasons.

In summary, Endgame is the near-perfect summer popcorn blockbuster event. And if you have been as invested in the MCU journey as I have from day one it will feel so much more than that. This is a genuine love letter from Marvel to the millions that have given so much of their time and passion to these movies and the eclectic stories and characters that have developed and entertained us over the past decade. From the opening moments it crescendos its way through your soul leaving you elated, exhilarated, and positively enthralled. And in the final minutes, with the gentlest of kisses and tenderest of goodbyes, you will be left with crushing sadness yet a feeling of contentment and satisfaction ... a very real closure to everything.

And if you are new to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, or just have a passing interest, do yourself a huge favour. Watch Infinity Wars, at a minimum, and then get along to see Endgame. Just make it happen ... whatever it takes.",9

I loved This Movie 3000,29 April 2019,Avengers:Endgame is a superhero film we all yearned for after the Infinity war spectacle and The Dark Knights standard but this film surely was far beyond expectations and was gripping entertaining humorous and emotional. Yes the movie kicks off to a slow start about the Avengers still learning and moving on from their loss but they found a way to reverse the ruins. Thanos the mad titan and the villain again proved to be one of the best villains abd surely some competition for the Avengers. It is a movie which will stun you This movie is a Perfect 10/10,10
Best Marvel Movie Ever,24 April 2019,"Better than infinity war. Ending is very emotional, and is very shocking. Wow, just Wow.",10
What Scorsese never can,19 September 2021,"This is how you make a finale, damn. It's very good and emotional, and managa to perfectly conclude 11 years worth of buildup. No other movie can achieve what endgame has.",10
BEST OF THE BEST,27 April 2019,"3 Hours full of emotion, action, tears and laugh.

This is how you end the film

Beautiful, impactful, amazing",10

The most overrated movie in history,1 May 2019,"Ah, humanity.. if the collective decides that something is good, cool and great, it sees it through tragically twisted perspective. This time, everyone just seems to fall under the brainwashing hype train of this whole Marvel cinematic universe cultural farce. Let's just shut our brains off and ignore the absolutlely OVERWHELMING amount of stupidity and shallow, fake pathetics that these plots and heroes present us with.

Not me! I'll say that the Infinity War was actually good, this was far too much of a brain hurting cringefest.",3
"Sooo good, one of the best movies",13 June 2021,,10
"There were 14,000,065 ways to make this movie",27 April 2019,"And they made the one that really, really worked. There were old people, 70+ years old, and young,6, 7, or 8 years old. Total fans and people who had only seen a few of the preceding 22 movies They all applauded. There were times the theatre was so quiet you could hear a pin drop. There were times when everyone held their breath. There were times you could not be so stone coldhearted that you would not tear up. There were times when you could not help but smile. There were times when you had to laugh. There were times when you recalled a special moment from an earlier movie in a brand new way. There were things that are brand-new By the end of the movie you saw the whole series in a different light. I wish I could see it again without ever having seen it beforehand. There were so many small touches that made the movie special and capped the series perfectly. And yet, the movie worked for people who had never read the comics or seen most of the movies. Like I said, they made the one that really, really worked. Thank you, Avengers! #Cap #Tony #Thor #Nat #Clint #Hulk",10
Epic and Beautiful Ending,10 October 2021,"After a historically shocking setup, this beautifully imperfect movie really stuck the landing. It's an accomplishment many franchises just couldn't do (ie Game of Thrones, Star Wars sequel trilogy) but Marvel pulled it off, which just has to be recognized as special. Our OG Avengers end their stories here in a film that balanced fun, humor, and sheer emotion very well. I've never experienced such feelings or had such fun in a movie theater. It truly felt like I was living through history. My favorite Marvel film.",10
Perfection,24 April 2019,"After watching Avengers Endgame , I am ready to say, with all my heart, that this movie is the most unique, fun, touching and satisfying movie ever... Oh and it's not only the best superhero movie ever, it's the best movie in history 🙌 --- ASSEMBLE!",10
AVENGERS' FANS ASSEMBLE! - Isn't this why we go to the movies for?!,26 April 2019,"My Rating : 9/10

This is exactly why people go to sit in a dark room with bright lights bouncing back into their retinas for pleasure!

Now on to the movie - 'Avengers : Endgame' is a finale of sorts of the Marvel Avengers Franchise which started back in 2008 with Jon Favreau's brilliant 'Iron Man' and we are already 21 movies in after 11 glorious action-packed years!

'Avengers : Endgame' is emotional, super funny and lots of little throwbacks to the previous movies for nostalgia value will make this the most talked-about and entertaining movie of the year - There's no place for critics here, it's about the fans' love for the series given justice. If you go looking for plotholes or keep thinking 'well this doesn't make any sense' or 'wow that's dumb' - this isn't for you! All of the MCU movies are romanticist in nature and they are for all ages to enjoy so they can't exactly become too dark or complicated for that matter.

Thumbs Up to the Avengers for making it a happy fan experience (and a bit teary-eyed one)!",9
Worst Avengers by far,1 May 2019,What a huge disappointment. Hulk is a wimp. Thor is a fat drunk. No fight scenes. I am a huge Marvels fan I could not have been more disappointed with this movie. Anyone saying this was great needs to be evaluated.,6
The movie Marvel fans deserve and need,28 April 2019,"If you thought Avengers Infinity War was the best Marvel had to offer, think again. Marvel ups their game by several notches in this movie. It's the perfect movie for the ending of a saga of Marvel movies. It's three hours of pure joy excitement and enthusiasm",10
End with no game,25 April 2019,"Pretty sure Robert Downey Jr got his lines wrong. What he clearly meant to say is back to the future is clearly a way better depiction of time travel. Long gone are the days where movies had real emotional empathy and believability, they must have got washed up in the shores of time. Great Scott, if only we could go back to when these film had tangible sets and characters with substance and weight. This movie begins where infinity war left off with half the population doing a disappearing act, involuntarily of course. Our main protagonist Iron Man is lost in space and somehow found out of nowhere with very little reason. The new kid on the block has a talent for picking out people from space with, with her arms, or so it would appear. Eat your heart out superman!! Yet we are willing to let most this go, the task of expanding the universe further seems exhausting enough. With a barrel load of character to tackle not even three hours can save this mess. Maybe because they have to stick to their Hollywood Marvel formula and get the routine thirty minute, am I watching a kid play Mortal Kombat? Battle scene in!! The only thing missing is the vintage finish him voice at the finale. Reminence of the battle scene in ""ready player one"" springs to mind. Don't misinterpret me I don't mind a well built up epic conclusion but unfortunate this felt like a reversal of what had already materialised in the previous outting. As far as character and acting goes our main bunch handled themselves to the usual standard. We had nice chemistry wisecracks and charisma throughout the film and with regards to pacing it's a little slow to start off with. It's a good thirty to forty five of we're getting the band back together!! Without giving too much away it is a very linear one dimension story but still packs a bit of a punch with some humour and emotion from time to time. With regards to empathy I felt more for the characters towards the end than in the early stages. I felt like they failed at the start where you should feel really sad for the friends they lost but they all seemed to have moved on five years on. Scarlett Johansson's character was the only one who made me feel like it had actually happened. Overall it was an average finish, nothing to go to mad about.",6

Amazing movie,20 August 2019,"This movie wrapped years of marvel movies I have seen and it was epic, people are saying it was slow it was boring, I don't think they understand how the movie was the story had emotion with that emotion you lived the last ever marvel avengers movie.

This movie is just amazing it has thrown everything in the mix and I would say if you have not seen this movie your are missing out.",10

Excellent storyline but poor character development,26 April 2019,"I think the storyline is great, really enjoyed it and it's really quite unpredictable. The scenes were really heart-warming but I had one serious issue with the character development and power scaling. That didn't allow me to enjoy the movie fully and when it ended I didn't get the very satisfied feeling which I had from Infinity wars.",10

Life Event!,24 April 2019,"You think ""Infinity War"" was mind-blowing? So was I...but man...""Endgame"" is simply the best cinematic experience in my life and every fan since the beginning of the MCU can confirm it! I still got chills after this movie...it will haunt me for so long! You'll cheer, you'll laugh, you'll scream and also you'll cry...a lot.

Watching this building of characters since 2008 on big screen and watching the culmination of it is hearthbreaking and emotional!

Also...they kept the script very well. 3 hours long movie and I needed more at the end!

Thank you Kevin Feige, Russo Brothers and all the cast members and people behind the scenses, who made this thing real. This is life event!

I can't wait to watch it again and again and again with my friends...and yeah I'll cry just like the first time, but man...worthed!",10
Best. Movie. Ever.,24 April 2019,"Ok, I have invested time and energy diligently watching (and enjoying) each one of the 21 Marvel Movies that lead to the culmination of the Infinity Stones Saga, over the last 10 years.

This movie really is the best cinematic experience that I have ever had. It hit every note, never disappointed and when the credits were rolling, I was already planning when to watch it next (in the cinemas), who to bring, etc.

To all the folk involved in the making of it... Wow! Truly world class ✊😃😎🙏🏼",10
Good but not epic.,26 April 2019,"The movie most disappointed. Boring but exciting in other moments. I've expecting receive an epic and amazing ending after 22 movies. But. I just received and screenplay with black hole that eat the logic and congruence. I'm disappointed. Furious.

I want to see a marvelous movie. But, why? Why marvel? You made a movie full of no logic just completely made for fan service. Is just a mixture of back to the future, and other moves referenced in.

Was good. Not epic. Was bad. Not terrible.

Unfunny. The jokes don't made me laugh. But see all superheroes in screen was emotional and right. Some minutes were boring and useless. Some characters were wasted.",6
The best marvel movie ever.,20 May 2019,I've always been a fan of comics either DC or marvel i was fan of both and supported both sides but to be honest The MCU is way better than the DCEU dont get me wrong but DC got a good future as i saw in aquaman and shazam but to see how all these 22 movies of the MCU just connect and reach its peak is just pure gold a great ending to a great era and i just can't wait what the phase 4 is going to bring us,10

Avengers: Endgame,26 October 2019,"Honestly, this is probably the best superhero film I've ever seen in my life. Not only does this film deliver on spectacle, but it's very character driven as well, especially in the first act. Not many superhero films can deal with grief and lost in such a great way, and then can make you laugh in the next scene without feeling jarring. I don't see how Marvel Studios can top this film.",10

Illogical and Convoluted,13 May 2019,"This is by far the worst MCU movie I've ever seen. Ever.

I was looking forward to it after last year's Infinity War, to see how they would bounce back from that Thanos snap. But boy, was I disappointed. The whole ""time heist"" plot is tortuously senseless, it lacks any form of intelligence from any aspect, be it scientific or imaginative. What kind of ""writers"" are responsible for this? Or what were they on while ""writing"" this? The quick one-liners, barbs and quips are cringe-worthy and so are the ""comedic"" situations.

One can objectively agree that the movie is way too long and boring for the first two hours, even my 11 yo super-fan brother thought so. It offers very little entertainment. The plot is too incoherent for any sensible adults and very complex to follow for the young ones so they just eagerly await the battle finale. Which does arrive at the end in the form of a badly choreographed CGI bukake scene with pyrotechnics and many, many cuts for anyone to follow what the heck is going on.

Massive, glaring plot-holes abound from start to finish which I bet are invisible to the throngs of fanboys all over the world over-hyping and claiming this piece of hot, leaky garbage to be the greatest movie ever made. Along with giving it over the top reviews and ratings.

Can't believe this is what sells to the masses and makes studios billions of dollars now. Makes me lose all hope in future superhero movies. I couldn't wait for it to get over and go home. A complete waste of time.",1
This movie is the perfect conclusion of ten years of history,5 May 2019,"A masterful epic that not only concludes the past 10 years, but also sets up the future of the MCU. Avengers Endgame delivered an outstanding and creative story while still adding meaningful conclusions and new beginning to our favorite characters. 9/10",9
Excellent Movie,29 April 2019,"Really really enjoyed watching Endgame. Captain Marvel is a distant memory. Despite Brie Larson being featured in Endgame it was only in a couple of scenes so it wasn't too bad. Endgame is incredibly sad, sometimes funny but very entertaining. Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo and Karen Gillan steal every scene their in. Will definitely watch again. Hopefully in phase 4 Captain Marvel will take a back seat just like Endgame.",8

What a journey,2 May 2019,I watched the movie twice so that I can give a proper review and get clarity on my thoughts . The first time watching the movie was a rollercoaster ride but the second time around I could appreciate it much more ... Yes there are many flaws in the movie without a doubt but it gives an amazing closure to most of our beloved characters. Joy and sadness ....,10
Anti climax,12 May 2019,"Wow, that was a major anti climax. With a title as 'Endgame' you'd expect it to surpass every story before, not an endless get together, 1 major battle where 1 action here solves it all and then a lengthy farewell. Wished they would have spent more on a good script instead of on 1 big scene full of CGI",6

Phase 3 ended poorly,4 May 2019,Ranged from merely ok to messy and contrived. Disappointed they resorted to a time travel movie (was that the best they could come up with??). Hated what they did to Hulk and Thor. Hawkeye was irritating and Captain Marvel was hyped up for basically nothing... Infinity War was far far better.,6
OVERRATED TERRIBLY,28 April 2019,So so over hyped a bit above average but far too long. The hype here is real thank goodness I only paid $5. Wait for it come our on Firestick.,3

We are in the End game now ...",10
Non-fangirl LOVED this one,19 May 2019,"There have been few Marvel movies that I vaguely liked, and over the years, I've fallen asleep through many. I straight up didn't understand some of them, and none of them did I genuinely enjoy the whole way through.

Except this one. This one is different. It is the only one that made me care about anything that was happening. Spending a lot of time on story/emotional development in the first hour made me care about what happened the last two. And it flew by, didn't even notice. I cried, laughed and actually cheered/rooted during the last fight scene.

Best one of the bunch for me. Glad it could wrap up on a high note.",10
Not as expected,1 May 2019,"Had huge expectations from End Game after the ending of Infinity War and it just fell flat after initial 40 min's.

Movie feels boring at lot of places and the ending....lets not talk about it... could have been more sensational. There are few moments having humour...but those moments are very shortlived. What worst...made martyr of character whose movies were the best of all Marvel Universe.",6

Perfect!!!!,28 April 2019,"I will write this without giving a single spoiler. As many of us Marvel fans have started this journey over 10 years ago, I can confidently say that we have grown up and grown so very attached to each character. We've connected with these Superheroes on so many levels, love, joy, happiness, and so many laughs. I'm usually a tough critic with movies, but I cannot say any other than this wasn't just an amazing Marvel movie; But an amazing movie in general. Every aspect of this movie brings you so much closer to the Hero's we fell in love with as children and showed us why they are hero's. This is a must watch Movie. And as funny as this sounds, this Superhero movie was Beautiful, thought invoking, motivational and so very loving. We could not have asked for anything better. Lastly I will say is, Marvel gave us a perfect start to the world of Marvel and most importantly a complete and perfect start. I honestly want to thank every single person involved with this masterpiece and say how much I appreciate what we e been given.",10
Amazing but room for improvement.,27 April 2019,"Movie is a little long. There are scenes that could have been made shorter or cut out completely. A LOT of exposition. Feels like we're being spoon fed what they are planing to do the majority of the movie. A cringe worthy feminist girl moment that makes your eyes roll. There was no subtlety there. The movie was a little messy with pacing but show a lot of heart.

There were two characters that I took a little issue with. Captain Marvel- Irritating and nasty with the few lines she does have. Really felt Brie Larson bleeding through the character with comments like ""well, you didn't have me last time"". I feel no respect for this character or actress and hope they remove her sooner rather than later.

Thor- Funny but the character seems to be dumbed down a little too much. Don't get me wrong, I'm a big fan and enjoy humor but this schtick went on a little too long.

This movie has a lot of really solid comedy, heart felt moments, and action. Yeah it has some plot holes but the over all story is good and a fair way to end Phase 4.",8
"I laughed, I cried; repeat x 10",28 April 2019,,10
Epic Finale,27 April 2019,"Endgame isn't just any regular super hero movie where ultimately the good guys defeat the bad guy. It's something entirely different. There's a Villain who's motive is really convincing andheroes who were defeated and are vulnerable. Ultimately it's not the triumph of good against the bad, it's the triumph of the greater good for all mankind. This is what that makes the movie unique. Russo brother's has done an outstanding job in bringing such a movie which is in a class on its own. Every single actors were excellent, but ultimately Chris Evans and Robert Downey Junior outshone every single person. Forget the negative criticism from peoples. This movie is a once in a generation event and must be seen from the theatre. Definitely it'll give you goosebumps.",10
Classic,28 April 2019,"Man this gotta be the best one, it wasn't how i thought it was gonna be but it was still dope.......",10

Avengers: Endgame Review,5 May 2019,"Avengers: Endgame is a film directed by Anthony and Joe Russo. This film was my most anticipated one for this year for a number of reasons. The trailers got me pumped up and increased my anticipation even more. But after walking out of that cinema hall, I felt that the creators did justice to all that was served to us in these past 10 years.

Plot: The Avengers decide to reverse Thanos' action done during the events of Infitnity War.

Story and direction: As this will be a non-spoiler I shall try to be as generic as possible as tio what I liked and didn't like about this movie. This film is a conclusion to a long story arc that started in the beginning of this cinematic universe. Yes, the film is three hours long (by far the longest in the MCU, too) but the best thing about the film was that the film never felt that long. And, for that, I would like to give a big salute to the creative minds behind this mega-blockbuster. In each and every minute of the move, you do feel for the characters. There is a sense of human-ism which is quite rare in superhero movies, which I was a big fan of. None of the scenes felt misplaced or unnecessary. I even liked the risks that were taken with characters which too is very rare for a commercial movie. The MCU brand of humour is there in some moments and I just loved them. This film had a proper balance of tension, entertainment and laugher, which is what wants from any kind of movie. Talking about the action scenes. OMG!!! They were huge, awesome and fantastic. Also, the VFX. My God!!! I can imagine the VFX artists had to do to bring so many of these scenes to like. And I salute them in doing that in the most seamless and effortless way. Alan Silvestri has also done a wonderful job on the score. I don't remember tearing up in any movie, but I surely did in this one. This film had such a profound effect in me. But in saying that, there were some scenes that did feel like plot-holes. Also, with the announcement of so many movies and TV show spin-offs this film still didn't manage to address so many things. But these, things are any way secondary to me.

Performances: Now if I list each and every cast member and their performances, this review will go on and on. But still, I will do some highlighting. People have been wanting Robert Downey Jr to be nominated Best Actor for the Oscars next year. And I really hope they do because this was the best of Tony Stark in the MCU. Chris Evans as usual is fantastic and I saw a side of him in this film which wasn't even tapped on in this universe. Chris Hemsworth was the funny man in this film. His scenes just made me laugh. Same can also be said for Paul Rudd. Mark Ruffalo too was just great as the Hulk and Bruce Banner. Scarlet Johannson and Jeremy Renner made me remember what made them so special and unique in this team. Josh Brolin again was fantastic as Thanos. All the rest of the cast members too were just great and commendable.

Favorite Scene: This is where I am out of words. But I will say it anyway without giving away anything. I will say it will be the one during the final hour of the movie where you will feel that are heroes have nothing to do. But then there comes a ray of hope and you feel that victory will surely touch our heroes' feet. Verdict: Is this film perfect? No, absolutely not. Does this film satisfy the MCU fan? Hell yes, it absolutely does. This film just made me realise why I love movies and why my love increases every day. Its exactly for films like these that I live for. Do watch the film in 3D (IMAX, if possible) for the best experience and I am sure you will have a smile on that face yours feeling a sense of completion and happiness. If the MCU has more films up in its kitty, bring them on because I seriously would like to see what more can they give. Yup, and for the first time ever: NO POST CREDITS. So don't need to wait till the end waiting for some random scene to show up.

I am going with an 8.5/10.",8
Arrow level first act. GOOD middle. EPIC 3rd act.,28 April 2019,"I'm a bit disappointed on the melodramatic first act. It was a really, really poorly written melodramatic first act.

It was, with Black Panther and Hulk, the most boring passage of a Marvel MCU movie. Some great parts here and there (mostly Tony, which was basically god like perfect in this movie, including Downey's perfect acting) and Rocket.

When the actual movie starts (and stops being basically an epilogue, a bad one, to Infinity War), it gets interesting even if a bit confusing (even with three hours, the plot explanation goes fast).

And in the end, the movie lands the epic ending. No words necessary.

Also, I would never watch that first hour and a half again. Which is a shame, considering how perfect Infinity War was.

-------Oh I forgot (this is an edit). Captain Marvel was in this movie (barely). I absolutely ADORE HER in every aspect. Her attitude. Her character. The actress. The looks.

But oh boy, her power level! Don't know if it's good or bad yet",6
It was hilarious,12 January 2021,"Was fortunate enough to watch this title in my late teens after becoming continuously disillusioned with hollywood blockbusters, especially comic book movies. Endgame is a glorious scrap monument of tropes and cliches with little continuity - it is Hollywood personified. While the MCU is an impressive achievement overall, a 2.5 hour long action figure line-up with sparkly, beautiful star actors interacting with glorified CG cartoons doesn't hold much substance beneath the glitz and glitter.

If you're like me, however, and have grown tired of repetitive tropes, this is a hilarious unintentional comedy.",3

EPIC,26 June 2020,"There's only one word to describe Avengers endgame and it's EPIC. The scale of this movie is incredible. Well deserved to be the highest grossing film of all time. Watching Endgame in the cinema was the best movie experience I have ever had. I'm so incredible impress how they manage to wrap all those movies in such a satisfying way. If you aren't a marvel fan or haven't seen the other movies I'm sure you will enjoy it just from the incredible action, entertaining story, amazing CGI, the performances and so on.",10
Movie of the whole MCU,14 May 2019,"Best of what anyone would just imagine, best everything totally loved this movie enjoyed every single second of movie",10
Took My Breath Away,28 April 2019,"Such a beautiful way to end such a fantastic series...or, rather, to end this chapter. Marvel has really outdone themselves and no other film could put that many avengers/superheroes on one screen and make it that good. I hope you haven't spoiled the movie for yourself if you are at all hesitant...whether it be fear of disappointment or not wanting to sit there for 3+ hours. Anyone that has kept up with all the movies will be blown away. Thank you Russo Brothers for making such a beautiful film.",10
So amazing!!,4 May 2019,"This film, to me, is damn near perfect. Yeah it has a few nitpicky things wrong with it, but it's wrapping up twenty-two films!!

You're not going to see a film of this magnitude again for at least another decade!

It's sweet, it's funny, it's exciting, and you can't even feel time passing. It's a thrill from beginning to end.",10
Ending wasn't that good as people say.,26 April 2019,,7
Even more awesome!,25 May 2020,"This is WAY better than Infinity War, my opinion though. But Thor-bawski was played for laughs too much.",10
Solemn and Subdued,30 April 2019,"I would be lying if I said that I wasn't a little disappointed. The Avengers: Endgame has been one of the most anticipated movies since... well since The Force Awakens but that was way back in 2015 and in this day and age that's like a million years ago. The point being: Endgame was the talk of the town since all of those beloved MCU characters faded away. Infinity War was such an epic movie what could Marvel do as an encore? Or better still, what could Marvel do to conclude the magnificent journey they took us on?

If anything, Endgame proves that it's hard to write a perfect ending. Perfect endings are stuff of legend. Whether the ending has a twist, a ride off into the sunset, or a mixed bag they are hard to write and hard to execute. Endgame is supposed to be just as the title suggests: the end. This is where the Avengers wrap it all up. Endgame was one long goodbye and it seems they tried to make it as heartfelt and dramatic as possible.

Infinity War started with a bang and ended with a bang. It was a fast moving roller coaster throughout. It came together so nicely with all the different characters, the different tasks, and the different battles. It was a superb blend of flavors that came together for an excellent meal. Endgame, on the other hand, was almost like a decompression. If you were huffing and puffing from Infinity War then Endgame was a chance for you to rest, catch your breath, and absorb all of what happened. It was a long slow exhale with just one last burst of energy before retiring. And it wasn't what I was expecting.

Not that getting what one expects is necessary to be considered good because sometimes you can be surprised in the best way. After all, we've trusted Marvel thus far so no reason not to trust them to put the finishing touches on their masterpiece. Now that I've seen their final brush strokes and the completed work I have to say that their hand slipped a little when adding the finishing touches.

Like a fireworks show or a symphony I wanted the ending to be this huge crescendo. I'm not talking simply about the last 20-30 minutes of the movie, but the entire movie. I wanted to see all of the fine Marvel characters in their finest form, or close to it, as they went for their last hurrah. I wanted them all to be like John Elway retiring after his second Super Bowl, retiring on top, not Muhammad Ali who held on too long and had a less than flattering exit from boxing. But that's not what I got.

We got to see heroics, of course it's a superhero film, but it was so subdued. The entire tone of the movie was muted. It was a somber morose three hours. The humor wasn't as humorous. The fighting was somehow less awesome. Everything was just darker and more lifeless. Even the hero moments which were supposed to evoke the most joy, awe, and righteous triumph didn't quite do it. Now it could be because it was 12 a.m. by the time the movie wrapped up and I was tired but I don't think that was it. Many a movie has revived me due to it's captivation. End Game didn't revive me or stir me in the way I thought it should. If anything, they put me to rest along with the Avengers saga. I was going for a conclusion, yes, but I also wanted reinvigoration and revival. Sadly, I got solemn and subdue",6
To all 10/10 did we see the same movie?,30 July 2019,"I think End game is non sense How could they destroy the story by missing with time ! killing Thanos erase infinity war so End game is never happen and I wonder about Captain Marvel ..half the univ disappear and she was to busy or did not notice tell she had a missed call ..and once more she come to do nothing here ! come on ! I waited too long for this movie to understand why the ""heroes "" of infinity war give up willingly infinity stone to thanos however the know what he will do! but now never mind it is just a movie no story not a big deal p.s I liked what happen to ironman",4
Die hard marvel fan,28 April 2019,"Awesome movie.. a special treat to the marvel fans by the Russo bros. really liked the movie, a must watch movie for every marvel fan out there. Its really the ENDGAME, a nice and sad ending of the infinity saga.",10
Classical piece,28 April 2019,One of the best Sci fi movie of all time.. end of an Era for great Tony Stark.,10
truly amazing,14 October 2019,This film was done so well. The 3rd act I will say in my lifetime will never happen again. This movie brings all the feelings inside to life 10 fold. I love this movie,10
A Movie That Serves As A Fantastic Conclusion To An Already Great Saga,28 May 2020,"Avengers: Endgame will be a film that I will never forget. When I first saw it I loved it. It serves a satisfying conclusion to the Infinity Saga with how it wraps up what was started in Infinity War while giving wonderful send offs to some of the most recognizable characters that we've grown to love ever since 2008. Overall, this movie was fantastic and personally is and will be a film that is not forgotten due to it being such a satisfying conclusion to the already great Infinity Saga",10
Simply Amazing,25 April 2019,"An epic film in size and enjoyment. Everyone involved with this film deserves a standing ovation. Many films are hyped up to a hysterical point but then fail to deliver! However when it comes to EndGame, there will be little to criticise in this epic conclusion to a generation worth of mostly brilliant films!",10
Satisfying,2 July 2020,"This is where everything we've watched comes together and it is a thrilling movie experience. Although still not as good as the original avengers film. It is truly impressive how everything is blended beautifully with a mind flowing finale. Sure the time traveling stuff feels a little unnecessary but it works for the overall story. Its complexity gives all the performers here some inspired moments. I mean it was one hell of an experience being in the theater opening night and watching the audience go insane. This too me feels like the end of these films and although it goes on just a bit too long it ties everything up nicely.

Why did you do this?,10 May 2019,,6
Simply the end game (Spoilers),15 May 2019,"You can't give rating to this movie just based on 3 hours spent in movie theatre. This movie is (like title says) end game. It's end of the 21 movies combined. Everything has been leading to this, and it ended in most spectacular way. Yes, you can watch this movie without seeing first 21, but you simply won't understand it, and therefore, you won't like it. But, if you have seen the end game, do not bother to watch firs 21 movies, because you already spoiled yourself ending. There is the reason this movie got so much hype, and that is because we connected with every character in it. It doesent matter if some characters didn't get much screen time in end game, because we had our time to watch them, get to know them and their stories. I won't talk about CGI and other stuff, thats personal preferences, but let me just say, amount of effort to get this resoult is aomething you won't bee seeing in short time. Best MOVIE FRANCHISE EVER for me, gets 10/10",10
Doesnt make sense,30 April 2019,,6
Endgame or end of MCU?,29 April 2019,"Most cringe worthy superhero movie I've seen. I was eye-rolling most of the time. Near the end I was just hoping for it to finally end. I mean, where to begin, is totally messy and nonsensical! All the time travel doesn't make sense at all. After all the hype I'm so mad at how bad it was.",5
IMAX VERSION,12 November 2021,Sir please add IMAX VERSION of this movie. ALL the movie is so great that every time i watch it gives me more details. And today is the day when i watch it again so add it as soon as possible.,9
Decimation to Epic Restoration,5 May 2019,"After watching this twice, I understood the story of Avengers: Endgame. The Avengers failed after the Infinity War. Never in their lifetime faced an incredible and inevitable enemy like Thanos. Josh Brolin delivers a badass Thanos. He is smart, he did the unthinkable, and he made it tough for our heroes to restore the loss. Whatever it takes was the Avengers motivation. Huge sacrifices must be taken. Seeing the Avengers rise from hopelessness and failure is the most amazing feeling in this movie. The huge price was delivered and this movie hands down is the best movie of 2019. The final battle makes it epic.

The Russo Brothers deliver a phenomenal film. I give them high praise for their direction and work to make this film the best. The actors and actresses are amazing, 22 movies in 10 years. All influenced into one movie. I love 3000.",10
Great Movie,6 May 2019,"I have watch this movie and really it is really the ""ENDGAME"" movie for all marvel movie since iron man in 2008. Wow, cant imagine thats already has been 11 years from that first MCU movie. Last word, FANTASTIC :)",10
One of the best movies of a lifetime,24 April 2019,"No spoilers here , I won't write anything , I just wanted to share that this movie is one of the best movies of a lifetime that you can watch now. Go watch it !!!",10
The perfect farewell!!,5 May 2020,A great ending to the phase 3 of MCU. The film's climatic battle is way better then any of the battle in infinity war and more emotionally charged than its predecessor. The background score was tremendous with equally good cinematography. People who rate low emphasis more on plot holes and goes way more technical than required. A film's job is to provide entertainment to its audience which it does satisfies.,8
Best movie ever !!!,27 April 2019,"I have seen a lot and I mean A LOT of movies and nothing beats this movie !!! Holy hell !! I mean just absolutely loved this movie !! The movie just is flawless ! It had me at the edge of my seat, had me crying like a baby (non spoiler), the acting from everyone was absolutely flawless and Josh Brolin as Thanos was AMAZING !!! THIS MOVIE DESERVES 100000 STARS !!!! I know it's my opinion but anyone who thinks this movie was not at least good just wants to be famous for trolling cause this movie is beautiful !!!",10
Victim of the hype train.,26 April 2019,,6
Frustration,9 December 2021,"You guys are about to release an extend version of this extremely watched, iconic and expected film with only 7 minutes more? Realy? That saga deserve at least 30 minutes of extra content. I liked the conclusion because i am watching since the very beginning (that's a bunch of years) and i want more than just seven minutes, actually, every fan deserves more cause we are the ones who kept this whole adventure going. I Hope someone that can make a diference (like an avenger) read this and understand.",10
"Maybe they should have followed the comic, either way felt a bit let down.",26 April 2019,"I just went to see the Avengers Endgame on Apr 25th, in Hawaii.

First, I have to say......it was a good solid movie. However, it did not touch me or speak to me. I was not moved at all. The Infinity Wars, was far more emotional and gut wrenching, this one was just an attempt to change things up, do the unexpected, and try desperately to wrench our emotions.

I will simply say that in this movie I was never mad, hurt, sad, or excited. No emotions this time.

Some of the battles were epic, and some were hyped up and fizzled out quickly, and some battles just never happened. Some disappointing moments.

Finally, when the battle was reaching a climax, and the home team got a chance to exact some revenge, things felt petty and predictable. Honestly, might have been better to follow the comic arc and stay true. Honestly, for the life of me, I do not know why I was not choked up in certain scenes when I should have been. Seems they were trying to hard to touch our hearts, and it felt disconnected.

Three hours later......and had to wake my wife up several times which is usually a sign. She was wide awake in Infinity Wars, beginning to end.

So if you just looking for revenge or a reckoning, congratulations.....you got it. But if you are looking for real emotional struggles and happy reunions......mehhhhhh......they tried....some were decent.

I will not give any spoilers, but I will say I am flat out angry because my favorite character of all time, since I was a child, did not fight! Seriously, WTF?! And after what happened in Infinity Wars, it makes no sense.",7
BORING!,29 June 2019,Fell asleep during the first hour. Too much talking. Realized this movie was for the new generation. Nick Fury finally makes an appearance during the last five minutes of the movie. Three hours of my life I can never get back. Gag me with a Smurf!,3
"Wonderful, Emotional and Heartwarming",26 April 2019,"After Infinity War I was worried about how Endgame would take the second half after the snap and I loved it. It was happy, it was sad, I laughed and I cried and I felt the characters and their stories went exactly where they needed to to. Bravo, Marvel!!",10

Didn't match my expectations.....,26 April 2019,"Infinity war was way better, in my opinion. There was a lot of plot holes in the movie to begin with. They had many cringe bathos moments and they crammed in too much emotional elements just to make the movie a n uplifting finale.",6
End of a epic saga with a new beginning,27 April 2019,I am speechless after watching this movie. Still having problem processing my thoughts after watching this movie. Some big changes were made and it will be very unacceptable to many hardcore MCU fans but everything must come to an end. The best ending to a decade of movie journey and end to an epic saga. Kudos to Russo brothers for gifting viewers this epic conclusion.,10

"This movie was the worst, most cringeworthy waste of a good story I have ever seen",9 May 2019,"Please don't waste your time with this one. This movie was the worst, most cringeworthy waste of a good story I have ever seen.",1
A phenomenal ending to the saga,27 April 2019,I must say when I sat down to watch Endgame I was expecting something else. This movie totally went left an once that plot was unraveled I literally feared for the hero's because Thanos isn't just any enemy. He's brutal. Couldn't have asked for a better ending to the infinity wars. Loved it,10
I love it !,12 November 2021,I'm a dc fan but i love the hell out of it ! The movie was slow but wasn't boring at all and i enjoyed every second of it. One of the best in the MCU.,9
"Thank you, Avengers",15 March 2020,"I am a post-90s generation, and I used to envy the ""previous generation"": audiences 40 years ago, the end of the Star Wars trilogy in their theaters; 20 years ago, audiences can see the ring in the theater The final chapter of the King series. The joys and sorrows of movie fans are not connected, but now we also have a common memory: Marvel Movie Universe. Thank you, Avengers.",8

It was not allowed to end!",10
Hitting us over the head,15 May 2019,"Endgame and Infinity War are pretty much on the same level in terms of entertainment. And that level is not very high. Look, there's no magic. The first Avengers movie had it along with many of the other firsts in the group. But that magic has gone away. First off, please don't hit us over the head with the emotion hammer. You did this by trying to lengthen out shots where characters look into the distance... for 10 seconds OR look at each other and hug 5 times. What was 3hrs could have been easily 2.5hrs with a little slice of that here or there. Overall, you're seeing the film for the characters you love... you're almost forced to if you're a comic book fan. If you're not a fan - don't bother.",6
The Climax!,12 November 2021,"It was unexpected, infinity war was really different to this but I like this concept, since it has to do with time travel we get to adventure back in the MCU, infinity war was the big 10 year film and this was part 2, instead of being a giant action film there was also time traveling witch means we can go a trip down memory lane and see some of the past of the MCU, this makes for a great big movie that has had this much leading up to it. The climax was also really awesome, it was just the biggest fight ever! Generally a different movie than infinity war, but still solid.",9
Under Expectations,1 May 2019,"For a movie with high score review and expecting to have a higher score than the Dark Knight for the MCU lovers, it's too standard although as concept is not bad.",7

It's all personal opinion of course but I grew up with the mcu and seeing the conclusion of 22 films really made me feel all warm inside, it brought back memories of seeing the first Avengers movie or hell even seeing the first Iron Man. The payoffs are fantastic and it wraps everything up nicely. Overall I'm impressed that marvel can make this big of a movie and not have it fall flat on its face.",10
Brilliant,26 May 2019,Don't listen to these trolls. If you've been a fan of the MCU you will love this. The one star reviews are absolutely ridiculous. The least you could give this movie is a 7 star rating.,10

The idea was not thought up well,30 April 2019,,6
This was better than Infinity War,28 April 2019,,10
Spectacular but redundant and uninteresting,16 March 2020,"More of the same - following Thanos' elimination of half the life in the Universe, the remaining Avengers decide to go back in time (or to an alternative time path, this is not really clear) to yet again look for the Infinity Stones so they can try to reverse the malignant halving. Since the stones are scattered around the Universe, once again a number of sub-adventures ensue, then there is yet another huge battle in which everyone in the MCU gets at least a cameo (including Captain Marvel and Scarlet Witch, so everyone else could have just gone fishing). Since the plot includes time-travel/alternate realities and infinitely powerful wish-fulfilment anything can happen, so just watch, don't think. Smart Hulk and Fat Thor are a lot less interesting than their predecessors and one can't help but wonder why the least powerful (and least interesting) Avengers are sent into space rather than participate in the more mundane search in the past (or whatever) or could the filmmakers have found an actress who looked less like a Valkyrie from Teutonic myth than Tessa Thompson. While clearly a fan pleaser, I found the film overly-long, derivative, and generally uninteresting. Too bad, as I really liked 2018's 'Infinity War'.",6
Not worth the time,26 May 2019,"This movie was a huge disappointment after the last one. Way too long, no character development, and a foregone conclusion. I'd say skip it but if you're an avengers fan, you have to see the ending. In that case, wait for video and don't expect much and you'll be fine.",3
Goodbyes,28 April 2019,"Thank you avengers,Specially Iron Man who taught us patience and fight 😭😭😭😭😭😭 #foreverfirday",10
Brilliant,4 May 2019,"Emotional, exhausting, funny heartbreaking. From beginning to end it takes you through all the emotions and ends 11 years of films brilliantly. Never had a film that gives me chills at so many different points. So worth the wait and definitely lives up to the hype. Visually stunning",10
The best,28 April 2019,This film was so much fun & love how Thanos was finally defeated once & for all.,10
Astonishing,27 April 2019,"As the ending of such a wonderful saga, Endgame surely is breathtaking and magnificent. The storyline flows and the timeline all well made, the acting performance is awesome, and though it's also heartbreaking not give you what you want, but it give you what you need. It's like the journey of life, where the ride bring you up and down, tears and joys, laugh and cries, but it the end, you get what you need. Not always what you want, but what you need.",10
"You went for Thanos, do not deny it!",26 April 2019,,9
Disappointing to say the least,1 May 2019,"I was immensely disappointed with this film. Avengers: Infinity War was exciting, had a good solid plot and story. I couldn't wait to see the follow up after the unbearable cliff hanger we were left with.

Avengers:End Game had none of these qualities. It felt like 2.5 hours of sentimental drivel and a 20 minute battle scene. I understand they wanted to wrap up the Avengers story but it just felt like it was more of a homage to the characters rather than a proper film. I was looking at my watch 2 hours in to see how long I had left before I could leave.

The only exciting part was the battle scene and that was poorly designed and predictable. If you want to see how a good battle scene is performed watch Game of Thrones S7 E3. That was ten times more exciting than the Avengers battle scene.

Special effects are always good in the Avengers films and this is no exception. It looks and sounds great. There were some amusing scenes especially involving Thor but they didn't save this disappointingly average attempt of finishing the franchise.",6
Absolute Perfection,3 May 2019,"Words aren't enough to describe the culmination of the Infinity Saga. It was just beautiful, from the amazing action set pieces to the well knit plot that tied up all the main character's story archs in a fulfilling way, all I can say is Marvel and the Russo Brothers really outdid themselves this time round. 11/10 for me.",9
Disappointed,30 April 2019,I personally preferred most of the other movies. It was just way too predictable and not that funny.,6
Hardly any substance to it,22 May 2019,,3
Masterpiece!,14 October 2019,,9
Favorite MCU Film!,16 August 2022,"Avengers Endgame to me is the very best MCU film to date. Not only because of the decade of buildup we had to this chapter but also the incredible acting and action! Everyone is on their A-game here and they are committed to it fully.

The action is also amazing! While it does take a while to get to it, when it does happen, it puts a smile on my face every time I see it.

It also represents how far comic book films have come. While there were certainly good ones before, this one shows how well they can be done and that they are worth seeing on the biggest screen. It also serves as a fantastic celebration of these characters and tribute to the comic book world.

Even someone like me who never really got into comic books growing up, these movies are greatly digestible for anyone who is unfamiliar with them and are always fun to watch.

Overall, Avengers Endgame is my favorite MCU I've seen.",10
Excellent,27 April 2019,"I love the ending for each characters. And only hate Captain Mavel, she tried to act like a ""super man"" who does not care about anyone or anything, and with a mind of teenager, she willing to jump into the enemy without thinking. Great job! I wish the film does not have her.",9
not a movie an experience,6 May 2019,I walked into the theater buying snacks for supposed to be the biggest hit of the spring well i must say i did not expect much however what i got was stupendous so so good loads of laughs action and adventure so much fun i do not recoomend taking the youngest of kids and also as this is a long movie if your theater lets you refill your snacks then you should do so,10
Great,21 June 2019,It was great but I expect more for the finale. I hope re-release version make it happen,8
its really good but not the best.,27 April 2019,Hyper ratings are not realistic it wont go over 8.5 for me,8
Could've been better,30 April 2019,"Wanted to love this movie. I really did.

All the Marvel movies have been great the last few years. Guardians of the Galaxy and Black Panther were superb. Infinity War was spectacular. Endgame was disappointing.

Pretty Good but unsatisfying,30 April 2019,Pretty good but I wished for more. More movies with just one super hero,7
Couldn't live up to Infinity war,29 April 2019,"Badly made. First hour felt like thrown together in few minutes. Some jokes just went out too far, I was really hoping them to go away towards the end... But no. Many characters simply ruined forever, which makes no sense. I did not enjoy the movie Most of the people will say this is good because of the Fan hype. I'm a Marvel fan all the way, but this just wasn't it.",3
"The perfect ending, one in 14 millions.",26 April 2019,"Watched the trailer and I went there to see lots of actions, jokes and CGI but It was something totally UNPREDICTABLE, it was a beautiful story well made for ages to come with touching key moments. It was very accurate to the comics, this was the real avengers made by Jack Kirby and Stan Lee. The actors performance and dialog was top notch, especially Robert Downey Jr and Scarlett Johansson. Thank you for this beautiful movie.",10
the best movie.,28 April 2019,,10
Definitely the BEST MCU movie ever,5 May 2019,"Endgame really makes you look at all the movies as a whole series of events with an outcome. It makes all the movies come together in a way that makes everything better. They really did something special with Endgame, especially with the challenges they had going into it.",9
AWESOME MOVIE ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤,30 July 2019,Avengers Endgame is an SUPER AWESOME movie . It actually made me cry and I'm a crying person.,10
The finale it deserved,4 May 2019,"In all honesty there is no recollection of any Marvel movie that can and did deliver on the full rollercoaster of emotions. I mean yes there is the strongest of possibilities you will cry in an Avengers movie.

Endgame I'm sure you don't have to be told is set after Infinity War, infact five years after, we see how the surviving gang have been impacted by the loss of their friends from the actions of Thanos. From there they take us on a journey of how they can fix their wrong. You wont even recognise that three hours have passed as it keeps you fully engaged.

Without giving too much away you will see how the next adventures may transpire and why there is a Guardians 3 coming. Really if you're a fan of the franchise you're going to see this anyway, so....... There will be no spoilers here (#dontspoilendgame).",10
A Pretty Good Summation of The MCU,19 April 2021,,6
A path of ten years,13 July 2020,"Marvel Studios has been the largest producer of superhero movies for the last decade, achieving something never done before, creating a universe of connected movies and that these end up cohesive at a certain point. That point would be 'Avengers Endgame'. The film is mainly about how the Avengers try to reverse the events of their predecessor 'Infinity War'. It was to be expected that Marvel Studios was up to the task in this latest installment of its franchise and it certainly is, in part. The main achievement of the film lies in how it manages to unite all its plots and give a worthy closure to each character, but despite this, the film still has an unorganic script, something that was not the case in 'Infinity War'. This script is used as a mechanism to honor this universe and its fans, but in exchange it sacrifices a more coherent narrative. It is for this reason that the greatest achievement of 'Endgame' falls on the construction of this universe, rather than on the film itself. A film that should be seen as a tribute to this path that has been traveled for more than ten years and that delivers a highly satisfying event not only for the characters, but also for the fans of the franchise.",9
Not as good as Infinity War,2 June 2019,High hopes for this one but a bit of a let down Im sorry to say.,7
1.5 hour movie made 3 hour movie,4 May 2019,"The length of the movie increased with long talks, which makes almost no contribution to the plot or highlight heroes characters. Instead of Marvel usual excitement feeling (although I am not big fan of comics) you get the feeling was it worth to spend 3h. If the movie would be brutally cut to 1.5 it would be good end product by Marvel.",3
Greatest Cinematic Triumph???,1 May 2019,"This movie is near perfect. It doesn't work without the MCU films that came before it, but if you've seen them all, WOW. packs a serious emotional punch. Fun, funny, sad, I got all the feels.",10
Marvel Studios cracked it again!!!,26 April 2019,"If you thought Avengers: Infinity War (2018) was as best as it could get then you're sadly mistaken. Endgame doesn't disappoint, with amazing references, those one liners and a pinch of comedy; this film is definitely setting high standards. The perfect balance between drama and action. A must watch!",9
Thank you so much to everyone at Marvel that made this happened.,24 April 2019,I'm so grateful that in my lifetime I'm able to follow this journey of a epic superhero story. I salute every single one that made this possible from the beginning. It's not easy to keep all the actors working together over a few years to deliver something as big as this. And there isn't a single thing that I don't like about this movie. I won't say more but I believe many of you will be blown away like I was. Go watch it!!,10
Avengers: Endgame - 9.4/10,24 April 2019,"This film is hard to talk about without spoiling it, it is a 3 hour movie and the furthest I'll go in terms of talking about what is in the movie, is to say that we have seen nothing of it from the trailers. The movie is very heartfelt, and that's performed by the excellent character development. Throughout the years of the MCU, you feel like you know these characters, but not that personally, and this film definitely fills the missing gap there. We actually get to see these characters not fighting, doing things many of us wouldn't imagine and it makes these guys we have seen on the big screen for the past 11 years so much more lovable. This movie is also truly ror the fans, coming into this movie with not much knowledge about Marvel wouldn't make you feel the same way of the movie that a fan would in terms of understanding and emotions. Avengers: Endgame is pieced together masterfully, by the Russo Brothers, who I must acknowledge for directing a movie like this. They did an excellent job with pacing, plot and keeping the whole 3 hours completely discrete and unpredictable. This movie very much feels like a culmination of what the past 11 years, and 22 movies in the MCU have lead up to. The final act is absolutely astounding, and really shows you what the MCU has come to, being one of my favourite scenes from not only all of the MCU but also that I've ever seen. Make sure not to miss a single minute of this movie, with all of it being important. This movie was so close to being perfect, making the right choices, bringing an emotional tone we've never had before and so much more that worked, but there were a few tiny problems. Firstly, CGI seems a little bit off in some or the scenes, which is a bit disappointing but minor enough to the point that no casual watcher would notice. Second, some of their jokes just don't land, especially in one scene at the very end. Third, it feels like it could be a bit shorter, with some scenes in the second half that didn't really matter. Overall, this movie is astounding, but only for Marvel fans. The 3 hours doesn't feel that long whatsoever, maybe feeling a bit long towards the end, but the movie keeps to be very entertaining all the way throughout. Avengers: Endgame is the best representation of Marvel as a whole, and is easily the best MCU movie yet, with Captain America: Civil War right below it. There are many theories online, and I'm aware of most of them, I can confirm that nearly all of them aren't even close or barely play a part in the movie. It definetely will hold up as the best movie of 2019, and I can't wait to see what's in store for the MCU. Keep in mind, there's no after credits, it doesn't matter how long you stay. Besides, the very final scene itself feels like an after credits scene.",9

It's a film that had big boots to fill but the good news is that it's a complete success and every bit as enjoyable as its predecessor. At three hours I wasn't sure about the pacing, but even during the slower first half the viewer's interest remains piqued thanks to the witty dialogue and huge cast of well-established characters doing their thing.",10

"All-Round Roller-Coaster Emotion, EPIC, Not A Perfect Movie, but A Perfect Ending to Infinity Saga",25 April 2019,"I am trying to be honest and being objective as much as I can : this movie is EPIC, I am sure ever single person in the world who has watched it will be pleased and satisfied. It was a complete emotion-packed movie.

It has a few flaws, I am sure some Marvel fans feel it too, some may be annoyed by the flaws (the directors should have done this, done that, why not this, why not that, minor plot holes, etc) but all was paid off by its EPIC-ness.

PS : I felt empty after I watched the Endgame, even until I write this review. It is not because I don't like the movie, it is just because I am not sure whether the next MCU saga will be as GREAT and EPIC as this. Good luck for the future MCU !!",8
Overrated film,7 June 2019,"Just because Marvel made the movie Hollywood's highest-grossing doesn't mean that this is one of the best Movies in the history, also this is not one of the best movies of the Superheroes genre, not even the best Marvel movie which is Iron Man since this is the only one decent they have in their lousy repertoire called the MCU.

Sorry fanboys but is the true.",6
"Avengers endgame: perfect ending for the MCU, but it wasn't the ending for some reason",1 December 2021,,9
Watchable......,11 May 2019,"The comic book hero genre is what I call ""bulk viewing"". A mass produced product that has a formula that's repeated over and over, with a few tweaks here and there, to keep the viewer coming back for more.

Avengers: Endgame is yet another case in question. I knew it going in and was in no way surprised by a predictable end to a mostly predictable story.

Its not bad as such. In fact, if you can accept it for what it is, its quite watchable on a superficial level. I'll add I'm not a film snob I enjoy a simple action romp from time to time and this certainly comes recommended.

There's a lot of wall to wall action that's well paced and keeps kicking along. My only gripe is the overcooked ending, that's so syrupy and sentimental, you could spread it on toast.

7/10 from me.",7
God dammit,8 September 2019,It's rewind time everybody! I hate this movie. Go away.,3
AN ONCE IN A LIFETIME EPIC EXPERIENCE!!!!,28 April 2019,"After 21 movies, this epic saga has come to an end. Avengers Endgame is one of the finest superhero movie ever made. The movie perfectly captures what made this franchise so unique and dear to all the fans. The movie is packed with humor, emotional moments and offcourse some epic battles. Those who are the old fans will obviously love this movie but the new ones who haven't seen any marvel movie would still find something good. Overall this movie is not just an movie but an experience. An experience of lifetime which can only be enjoyed on the largest screen possible.",10
The endgame we deserve.,26 April 2019,"I can't review it, cannot be described with words, experience it yourself on theatre guys! It's really THE ENDGAME! Whatever the expectations i had, it had gone even beyond that whatsoever!!! Just watch it without knowing any spoilers! 11 years of hardwork paid off, GG Marvel!",10
A thrilling and satisfying conclusion,30 April 2019,"Kevin Feige and the Russo Brothers have done a fantastic job here. The film is guilty of a fair amount of inevitable plot holes, for which it cannot be considered a 10/10; yet it does a fantastic job of bringing a worthy conclusion to the 22 MCU films so far. It succeeds in juggling the many character arcs, moving pieces and increasingly complicated storylines whilst keeping the movie focused and making room for some truly thrilling action sequences in addition to many laugh-out-loud moments.

It's certainly worth watching Captain America: The First Avenger, Thor 2: the Dark Wold, Avengers Assemble, Captain America the Winter Soldier or, Avengers: Age of Ultron, Guardians of the Galaxy 1 and 2, Captain America: Civil War, Avengers Infinity War, Ant-Man and the Wasp, Doctor Strange and Thor Ragnarok at the least before viewing this film. As reflected by certain reviews, there are many parts of the film which would seem confusing or frankly boring without the knowledge of the various storylines involved, yet which will be of great interest to followers of the MCU.

Having watched this film I'm truly excited for phase 4 of the direction the MCU looks to be taking going forward.",9

Everything,4 May 2019,"Amazing. Absolutely amazing and heartbreaking. Triumphant. Breathtaking. And soul crushing. Someone asked me what I thought of Endgame...and all I could respond with was, there are so many words! There are so many reasons why this was the perfect superhero movie...I wouldn't have time to name them all. Do I have my gripes? Yes. I do. Maybe it's because I still haven't seen all the MCU movies that led up to this one. Or. Maybe it's because I was sitting in the front row on the right side, so I had to look at the screen as though I were watching a tennis match. Back and forth and back and forth. Whatever the case, I was in complete shock. And I laughed so hard I cried a bit. I smiled nonstop. I was so taken aback that I gasped, held my breath while covering my mouth for extended periods of time. My heart was broken multiple times to where I ugly cried uncontrollably. Even now, hours after watching the movie, I feel so destroyed by certain moments that my eyes weld with tears just thinking of those scenes. I cheers for the men who did the damn thing. I cheered for the women who banded together and rocked. I cheered for the black characters that many thought shouldn't be or shouldn't have made it. I cheered for Captain America. He was always worthy. I respect the Black Widow. I cheered for love. And second chances. This movie gave us everything we needed and more. I will watching it a million times over because every now and again, I'll need reminding that someone out there loves me 3,000.",10

Beautiful,26 April 2019,,10
My Least Fave Among Avengers Films,13 February 2020,"This movie really is what you would call a cinematic event, seeing as it is the culmination of 10 years of storytelling across several movies ( of varying quality). But Endgame doesn't feel as satisfying as Infinity War or as entertaining as Ultron.

Seeing this in the theater with a cheering crowd was unlike anything I've experienced as people were crazy hype about this one, but outside of the appeal of crossover between characters the film isn't too entertaining.

The three hour runtime is very much felt (especially on rewatch at home) and there are a lot of scenes that just feel like exposition.

A decent Marvel film all things considered.",6
Better than Game of Thrones Season 8,4 August 2019,"What a boring, predictable excuse for a movie. I'm so glad I resisted the hype and didn't suffer through this in the theaters.

Endgame is in a slowcooker,28 April 2019,"Right, this film is excellent. I would say I preferred Infinity War, as it was right in your face from the beginning. Now Endgame, has a lot of build up. So all that rubbish about not being able to go for a pee, in fear of missing something. Do so in the first two hours.

Watch out for the peanut butter sandwich.",10
Avengers Endgame is an awesome movie,13 May 2020,"Avengers Endgame is, above all, a great homage to the ten-year history of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The story highlights the original Avengers team. Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Hulk, Black Widow and Hawkeye are at the center of events. No character comes in front of them. Of course there are many characters that play an important role in the story outside the original Avengers team. Everyone's concern was that Captain Marvel, who was included in the Marvel world, overshadowed other heroes. We can say that this certainly did not happen. What is important in this struggle is not how strong you are, but how good you are. This comes to the fore in all areas. It gives good message about being a hero and a family.",10

We miss you 3000 #avengers.,6 May 2019,"A story that Russo brothers started 10 years back came to an end.The fictional characters made sure they remain with us till last breath. Goodbye hurts no matter how beautiful it is and ofcourse not watching AVENGERS ASSEMBLE in future will even hurt more.Thats how impactful it was, even if you haven't watched any marvel movie watch them watch them all and witness the magic of how a 180+ minute movie binds you with emotions,actions and of course never ending love towards our superheros.

I have seen it twice already and will probably see it a third time.",10
avengers endgame,22 March 2020,"Even if i really loved infinity war and i consider it to be one of best comic book films ever made in scale and heart,but i must say that i loved endgame even more since it doubled all that things and made them even better,and it give us great conclusion to the era of mcu since 2008,endgame had brilliant actors that did a marvelous job and i think that werent any weak link,thanos maybe less focused then in infinity war but still he was able to bring staff that we love about him,this film also has some very sad moments with emotional punch but i think that they did a great job in closing characters arcs and stories,sure there is some staff about time traveling that is messy but in this kind of film i simply dont care",9
Cry every-time I watch it,25 September 2019,I'm just gonna say I don't think they could of made a better finale.

The perfect blend of humor, action, and emotionally powerful scenes. At first I was finding to tough to believe they would be able to surpass the events of Infinity War, but I knew the Russo Brothers and great team behind this movie were gonna be able to pull it off. And they did just that. The hour of the movie left me with tears of joy and tears of sadness at the time. By the time I was leaving the movie theater my eyes were and stingy due to the amount of tears I had cried. As someone who has been watching MCU movies since the very beginning and seen every single one this move was true worth the 10+ year wait. Could not be happier.",10
barely watchable,23 November 2020,While not a total disaster it's way below what i'd pay to watch. i'd rank it at 5 wich is right under what i consider worth the time to watch,6
Breddy gud,27 April 2019,"More emotional than infinity war, fight scenes still good though, writing is a little more reliant on plot devices compared to the previous film but they throw in a good amount of comedy",8
Not as good as I was hoping.,29 May 2019,"A poor finish to the avengers saga. Too many characters with not enough to do. The final battle was underwhelming. Some of the main characters (Thor,hulk) reduced to buffoonery. Some good points like cap and Starks final ending. Thanos is probably one of the best baddies ever. The guardian's and antman were poor. Far too long a film and was padded in places although I can forgive it because we probably wo t be seeing the actors continuing in their roles. Not as disappointing as game of thrones though. Younger viewers will love it.",6

Gotta take your Dad,4 May 2019,"This is an edit on my first review where I talked about how I loved it more on my second viewing than my first, but over time I now think more about how my Dad took me to see the star wars movies and the Indiana Jones movies and how that was my childhood. I took my kids and I hope that when they grow up the avengers theme is what the star wars theme was for me!

My Dad has passed away and my regret is I couldn't show him what he showed me.

I can take heart though knowing that I've now replaced my Dad in the scenario and hopefully passing on the same memories with my kids.

Take your Dad man, you'll be forever grateful.",10

It's was long and stretched out, they had to put things in there that didn't have any business being in there, and in the end I just felt like it was a big ball of confusion.

I was very disappointed in this one and so was my husband. Infinity Wars was great LOVED it but this one wasn't great.",4
Fitting End to the Infinity Saga,28 April 2019,"After almost 48 hours of story Endgame is the epic fitting end the MCU deserved for the Infinity Saga.

"Far from flawless, but no less significant for all that",9 May 2019,"Has a mass-market blockbuster ever opened on such a downer as this one? Infinity War's ending made anything else impossible, of course, but what one expects from such a major movie is not an hour or so of a whole set of characters learning to live with loss and grief. It's to the movie's immense credit that this sustained so long, and so well handled, to the extent that the occasional flashes of Marvel humour in that segment of the film don't seem out of place. Occasionally we pan out to the big picture and global scale of the loss. One character saying ""I miss the Mets"" brings you up short; so many have died that, even 5 years later, professional sports can not function. Another powerful moment is a scene that takes in a monument bearing the names of some of The Vanished - the monument seems endless.

As well as this is handled, this wasn't my major concern ahead of the film. That revolved around what Endgame was going to do about the overwhelming loss of Infinity War. Science-fiction/fantasy stories run in to trouble, stretching credibility even in terms of their own worlds (which is the only credibility that really matters), when they get out of a narrative tight spot or emotional downbeat by pressing some kind of metaphorical 'reset button'; what happened didn't really happen, or is just undone. I feared even further when the proposed solution in Endgame started to be unpacked. In a manner of speaking, I was right to worry about this. A metaphorical reset button is pressed, but it's done in a deft way; the journey to that point is fraught with real loss that can't be undone, not to mention a bravura trip back through various points in some of the movies that have bought to this point, with scenes replayed from new angles (to say much more would be to risk too much of a spoiler). Both of these choices are well handled; as ever, this series mostly manages the dance between humour and sadness with great dexterity.

The major loss of the film was genuinely moving; other losses, less so. When you have a series of films that has (so far) lasted 11 years and 21 films, and introduced (according to Wikipedia) 226 characters, there's only so much attachment one can build up to many of them. Plus I'm old, and I forget things. This is especially so in one key plot strand that ends with 2 characters having to resolve which of them will sacrifice for the other. It's a powerful moment, but to be honest I just didn't care enough about them to really be moved by what could have been a landmark moment.

Much has been made in the last year or so of Marvel introducing its first film led by a black character (the excellent Black Panther) and a woman (the good but not outstanding Captain Marvel); these were indeed significant cultural moments. Endgame undercuts them somewhat by disappointingly sidelining them both for most of the film; admittedly, in the case of Captain Marvel at least, this may be as much to do with working out a reason for her immense powers not to be the solution to every problem. Even so, it doesn't really work for me; in the movie's defence in this regard, however, my 10-year old, previously superhero averse, daughter sat through it all without a toilet break or complain not once, but twice, because ""The girls kick butt!""; which is certainly true of some less central female characters.

Two performances stand out for me: Josh Brolin as Thanos is brilliant, managing to imbue such a cosmic villain with pathos. Paul Rudd (Ant Man) is, for me, one of the least appreciated parts of the MCU, and his performance is superb here; great comic moments, and an occasional cypher for the more casual viewer who needs to be caught up to events. In addition, any moment in which Taika Waititi gets to give voice to his flawless comic timing as the voice of Korg is a good one; more of that, please.

It's striking how little action there is for such a film; to be honest, this strained the running time for me. I think the middle third could have been contracted a little; it lagged at times. But I seem to be in a minority on that, as my daughter testifies above. For me it also suffers a little from 'Return Of The King' syndrome; there were several occasions when I thought it had finished (and wanted it to end), but another coda came along. Yes, there are a lot of character arcs to tie up; but it this is a film where neither the big picture nor micro narrative arcs are entirely smooth or neat, and the last 30 minutes or so dragged. What should have been a touching final scene for one character (and indeed the film) felt like blessed relief; other narrative developments earlier in the film were all but accompanied with a knowing nod to camera. The latter would at least have felt more in tune with the series' tone. The climactic battle isn't handled brilliantly either; there's too much going on with too many for me to really keep track of what's happening; a common fault of superhero films (Black Panther being one of the notable exceptions). I'm thinking that in this regard the makers could have learned from the flawless execution of the massed battles in the Lord of The Rings films.

These are small complaints in context. We do need to take a moment to acknowledge the Marvel achievement here; when the first Iron Man movie kicked this all off 11 years ago, none of us really knew what would happen. None of us expected what has transpired; a multi-stranded, complex, overlapping set of blockbusters that (largely) standalone for the causal viewer, bring in new fans with no loyalty to the comic books (like me) and serve the hardcore fans also. To reach this point of the project and to do so as one of the biggest films of all time, with the confidence to inflict real loss on its characters and audience, is a unique cinematic achievement which, for all the faults in this film or any others in the series, is something likely to never be equalled. If anyone ever says again that modern attention spans are too short and people don't really like complex stories any more, that conversation can be ended with the sample of the Marvel films (and Game of Thrones); all we need is characters we care about, and we remain capable of following even the most complex of plots. Remember these films are serious hits amongst people much younger than me, with a far greater grasp of the narrative complexities spread over all the films. In that respect little has changed since story-telling began.

There are themes and ideas to mine from this movies, and all that's gone before. Some of them will sit long in the mind, some of them give merely a fleeting suggestion. In all honesty, to really mine and understand those I'll need to revisit them all over a more condensed period of time; Endgame is certainly a film that you enjoy with a relatively limited engagement of the preceding films, but the experience will be all the richer in relation to the viewer's familiarity with the breadth of the context. For now, we come to an end that is also a rest, and a pause. We all need to take a breath.",7
Most incredible moment in MCU,25 April 2019,"Endgame is absolutely the most touching and with most emotional elements among those 22 movies. And you can see the character's personal spiritual growth in these three hours. People who are brave, arrogant or selfish, they all become differently. All in all, it is the most significant moment in MCU. AND DON'T FORGET TO BRING TISSUE PAPER, you properly will cry if you have been follow all these 22 movies in this decade.",10

It's good.,10 September 2020,"It did its job at providing a satisfying conclusion for the quadrilogy. I don't think that it does anything exceptional or bad. Actually, that's not true. It does one thing exceptionally: It's three hours but I never felt the runtime. And it does something bad: The fat suit for Thor looked soooo fake.

And I personally thought what they did with the Hulk was hilarious.

But I'm honestly sick of Marvel at this point. I'm sick of superheroes and supervillains and the whole interrupting the plot to make a joke thing. And I can only see myself watching this again if someone else wants to watch it. I'm glad The Boys is a thing!",6

It could not be better!!!,28 April 2019,"Marvel has done it again. I won't spoil it but it has everything we've come to love about this franchise. I think only one or two things could change to improve it, but nothing major that's for future! It felt like family on the screen, and the theater filled with avid fans felt like family too. It was a crowning achievement, Stan would have been proud.",10

"Good but overhyped, nowhere near Infinity war",28 April 2019,"Overall its a good movie and may be an okay finale, it seems like the Seinfeld finale, after a great run a disappointing end, the movie story didnt have fluidity and seems the writers just wanted to finish all endings quickly rather than the smooth flow like in infinity war",7
This movie took 181 minutes of my live the i'll never get back.,26 May 2019,,1
Like,20 January 2022,"Entertainment. It seemed to me that there were fewer special effects, but the quality did not suffer from this, it looks in one breath. Marvel has definitely become a trendsetter in special effects. I will especially note how either make-up artists or computer scientists worked on Thor. In general, Chris Hemsworth, as it seems to me, will be remembered by many as TOR. Five.

The acting. On high. It is impossible to single out anyone in particular, everyone did an excellent job with their roles. Five.

Originality. In my opinion, only the quality of the film can be called unoriginal, as it continues to maintain a very high quality of the saga. Otherwise, the development of the film is completely unpredictable. For me, for example, there were several plot twists that were completely unexpected. But the most unexpected thing for me was the absence of two videos after the credits. Definitely five.

Music and sound. If there was something wrong with this film with the soundtrack, it would surprise me very much. And so, in terms of sound accompaniment, everything is tip-top, there is nothing to be surprised at. Five.",9
My bots and I,29 July 2019,I gave this movie a 1/10... watch IMDB change it to a 10 Pay to play. Welcome to the real world.,10
I cried... twice.,4 May 2019,"This movie is amazing. It's emotional, it's funny, it's intense. It's everything you want from a movie ending a decade old story arc. The movie is beautiful, the story is engaging, the acting is on point. The humor is exactly when needed and never too much. The fight scene... that was something else. The ending feels like a true ending and it's a treat to watch. This is the comic book movie to beat and I loved every second of it. 10/10",10
Not epic enough [edit: epic enough],26 May 2019,"Congratulations MCU on creating this 21-film cinematic feat. Was I expecting a better finish? Yes. Did I see the same movie as everyone else - it appears not. [edit: I've rewatched the movie a month later and found it more satisfying. This was the version with the post credits stuff to get us back in to push the box office into record territory. It's exactly the same movie, mind you. The character arcs are just great and the actors up to the task. My 3 key problems with the fillem are 1; The camera work for the special effects sequences are thoroughly inventive BUT the camera work for the post-trauma character studies is not inventive at all. Those scenes relied on the multi-movie character arc and sentiment more than camera direction and cinematography. Still worked for the lass behind us who was sobbing for the last third of the moofie. 2; the story is great until the time travel gobbledygook when I felt the emotive aspect lost momentum. 3; it's still hard to care as much about MCU characters as much as, say, the original Star Wars characters because in the MCU you know there's another injection of super hero greatness only months away. In the original Star Wars moofies it was years before you saw any characters again so the emotional impact was more profound. OK, so these points are all probably shrewd directorial choices and generational differences. Impressive, ambitious fillem overall] I found this move a bit of a snoozefest. The problem is, by another other movie's standards this was quite a good film. It tried for different tones and a different pace. I think a part of the problem is these movies that they shoot back-to-back. They really need a break in between films to look at the first part, ie, Infinity Wart, and see what they set up in that film. They then need to sit down and answer all of the key points that were raised in that film AND in all the previous MCU fillems. That would require a multi-layered script and a production that really turns up the ante. To me it seemed like the series really ended with Infinity Wart and this Endgame was like, the ultimate post-credits sequence. The final battle was awesome but non-sensical. Who IS the most powerful superdude/ette and why can't she (MarVel) beat Thanos? That stuff frustrates me. I mean, I was ready for the Scarlett Witch to tear him a new one but even that hope fizzled. I'll re-watch it on blu ray but I'm glad everyone else liked it. I'll always have my Return of the Jedi and Return of the King.",10

Worst Movie ever,9 May 2019,,1
Not so great :(,25 April 2019,"For me Avengers Infinity War was perfect marvel movie. this one was ok, not great not fantastic, it's just ok. it would be great if they didnt force too much comedie into the movie where half of population went missing and it was normal that we have a kind of drama/action movie and not another comdie action (when you see thor and hulk you will know what I'm talking about). it's ok ending. captain marvel arrival feels like GoT night king lifting dead dragon with chains in the middle of nowhere and nothing.

I hope there will be some another edition, where they cut it all stupid, not funny scenes and present real dramatic through whole movie, and not only last half of hour",8
A fitting end,1 May 2019,"I appreciated the movie greatly. They handled time travel in a very deft fashion, and tied it up nicely. I appreciate that they managed to maintain stakes for future installments.

I have been a marvel fan since MY beginning. I read the comics as a kid, and made my own costumes. I latched onto the MCU from film 1 and have been there for every up and down of the franchise. I am proud of how they brought this era to a close.",8

EPIC,27 April 2019,,10
The best finale I have ever seen,29 February 2020,There are many problems in this movie but the authors did everything they could to end the very phase of this big universe in logical way.,10
Part of the Journey is the end...,26 April 2019,"My undying passion for films (and other media) always lingered since I was a baby. That being said, my passion for this craft exploded when I saw the Earth's Mightiest Heroe's team up in 2012. Marvel Studios had something special on their hands with The Avengers, then Cap: TWS, then Guardians of the Galaxy, then Civil War.... and so on. They almost always one-upped themselves in terms of quality as each subsequent movie came out. The journey that we experience with these Heroe's is so very special, and I'm grateful for it. I always love visiting these stories every time they put out a film. (Trying my best not to sound preachy here haha!) I know some of this may sound silly, but these heroes have always been important to me. Marvel studios have always delivered (at least for me). They released my favourite film of all time - Infinity War, last year and I really didn't think they had it in them to top it. Lo and Behold, Endgame was perfect. It resonated with me on so many levels. I'm not going to go into specifics, because I don't want to ruin the experience for anyone, but these are the reasons why I absolutely, wholeheartedly love Avengers Endgame: As comics coming to life - there were scenes that EXPLODED my mind. I cheered my lungs out opening night. As a deep dive into characters - I felt the repercussions of the previous event that took place, I love the way they handled ""loss"". I was emotionally taken by the well-written script as well as the acting that carried the perfect slow-pace of the first half of the movie. The characters dealing with the snap in their own ways was executed so well. Connected with them on a whole other level. Loved the pacing of the film. I also love how each character has grown; If you go back to the early movies and then you watch endgame... Our beloved Heroes are fundamentally the same, with we'll set morals, though they've grown for the better over the years and continue to do so in this one. Growth of astoundingly well-made characters you care about should be commended. As for the laughs - there were so many of them, such great ones that landed 95% of the time. Well written comedy that I ate up. I think the comedy this time around was sprinkled in at better moments, that never broke the seriousness of a scene (when compared to something like Guardians 2...). A lot of fun laughs to be had ay! As of the action - FREAKING PHENOMENAL. I Screamed, I Cheered, I Clapped. I tend not to burst out with the above in theatres, but I couldn't hold myself back... Trust me, I tried. So well done. The entire third act is something to behold. As for the music - Alan Silvestri, take a bow. The Avengers theme is so iconic now, thank you for giving that to us. Thank you for using it so well in this film and thank you for creating new tracks that I know I'm going to listen to on repeat. The soundtrack was seamlessly awesome in this film! As for the directing & acting - The Russo Brothers... Alright, I'm not going to say anything more than I have before. You guys are the best, really, how y'all handle these mammoth tasks with perfection is beyond me. The two of you are crazy amazing. The actors brought their A game as always too. The movie focused on the core 6 avengers with a few exceptions here and there. RDJ & Evans took my breath away once again, but PAUL RUDD is a huge standout to me coming out of this. The way he handles his lovable Ruddness brand of humour with so much emotional depth in this film is brilliant. Scar Jo, Renner, Ruffalo, Hemsworth... You guys. I loved all of them, I don't want to pick out any favourites because they all played their roles to beyond perfection. As for the heart - Endgame, after one viewing has become my favourite movie of all time. This movie strung together a fresh, cool, heavy, yet satisfying plot with such care. Characters and Heart make or break a film for me, and Endgame is a prime example of how well the two are executed. I was emotionally drained at the end of the movie. I screamed my lungs off, I laughed my butt off and my lord, I uncontrollably cried my eyes out... Yet by the end of it all, I walked out with the biggest smile on my face. Thank you for this gift Marvel Studios.

A thing isn't beautiful because it lasts.",10
"IT MADE NO SENSE. Sorry, it made no sense.",30 April 2019,"They made it that way on purpose, so that most people would have to say ""yes, we think we understand, yea..."" so not to look like a bunch of idiots. There's power in the denial! But go watch it for the laughs, I'm not a type of person to cringe over a cheesy joke, but whoever was responsible for comedy relief this time around has gotten to me! Was it RDJ? He a genuinely funny guy.

I rate this sci-fi fantasy: 6/10 -1 for over the top CGI, -2 for deus ex machina, -1 for trying to make me feel for too many characters! Because I can't do lazy writing. and -1 for shameless AUDI plug but I won't go below 6.",6

I can say watching this movie for 3 hours, it tied up all the previous movies all in one bow and left no questions unanswered. I think some viewers wanted more death scenes but for me I was truly satisfied and entertained since watching all the marvel movies at the start of first Ironman. You will definitely try to hold back some tears which I was good at but this movie will try to make you cry. Hope you enjoy this movie as much as I did since this is the last avengers saga.",9

I Really Wanted To Like It,3 May 2019,"I admit I had fairly high expectations for this movie, but in this instance I find it justified given the buildup to this particular movie.

To put it shortly, it is inferior to Infinity War in every way. I've seen infinity war probably 8 times now and Endgame makes me appreciate it even more. The pacing and execution of Infinity War is incredible in comparison. Infinity war felt like a much more mature movie in that there are moments that still make me feel sadness for the characters and the pacing of the movie was far better. Endgame felt all over the place. There were moments I wanted to tear up but the scenes didn't feel adequate to really draw a reaction. They moved on far too quickly and the movie itself was choppy. It was hard to really relate to the characters. When I first saw Infinity War I wondered how they would handle so many characters in one film and be able to still have the audience empathize with them, but any doubts were laid to rest. This movie is pretty much the worst case scenario for how to handle many characters.

Don't get me wrong, there were parts that were quite satisfying, which is hard to go into further detail about without divulging too much information.

All in all this movie was saved by particular scenes and those few moments of feeling resolution. It felt more childish in execution and appeal and Infinity War felt more mature than the typical Marvel movie. When I saw Captain Marvel I really disliked it, but I thought it was a one off and they would be redeemed with Endgame. This was not the case.

Definitely see it, and see it in theatres if you can, just don't go in with the highest of expectations.",6
Mi Question,5 May 2019,"Now, that a week has spend after his releasing ay theatres, i'll explain muy question in Pesce. After five or six years after this, could there be something about this movie that makes recomended, else of his hype and the marketing?

I Am not a really Marvel or DC's fan, but i loved some of their movies such as; DC's: Dark Knight all, Wonder Woman, Man on Steel, Shazam. And Marvel's: Guardians of the Galaxy, Dr Strange, Winters soldier, and of Course: Infinity War. But i was waiting a lot about this, i has too big expectations, them go to the midnight releasing and i found a fast food product of movie; horrible script, horrible performance, stupid logic, terrible story. Really is this the current cinema's way? I ll'get out of this awful and cheap movie theather.",2

"This movie has ""what ever it takes"" to be an epic final !!",27 April 2019,"First of all, I have to agree on the comments that first half of this movie is really slow. There is only 10 minutes of action throughout entire 1,5 hours. However, it doesn't bore you, instead it helps you focus on characters and their feelings after they lost their friends and families because of Thanos.

Remaining Avengers members try to figure out a way to undo what Thanos did. Although most of us guessed what they were gonna do, the way they do it has a lot more to offer than you can imagine. That's where things starts to refer to almost every previous Marvel movies. It makes you laugh, surprise and cry.

You don't have to be a pure Marvel fan to enjoy it. Don't want to spoil it, just go and see it.",9

The Endgame,9 October 2023,"I'm writing this review on 2023. I know it's late, but I gotta say is that. Marvel studios is failed after endgame. They've failed in making a good movies like hulk, captain America, iron man, Thor. All they make is cringe hulk, low cost V F X, bad story. It's hard see our favourite comic studio is failing. And they make is coco - melon type movies. This is masterpiece from marvel. It's happy to see every heroes together and fighting thanos. It's absolutely fantastic and mind blowing. The story, the film making, the dialogues is absolutely incredible. I'd highly recommend this movie for anyone.",10

What a moving homage to a decade old franchise!,28 April 2019,"Not every highly-anticipated movie lives up to the expectations but Avengers: Endgame is one of those few that delivered almost everything that's been promised or to some extent, even more. Not only this is the perfect follow up to INFINITY WAR (2018) but a remarkably done, moving homage to a 10 year long successful franchise consisting 21 films!

While the first hour & so skillfully sets up the high-stakes, gradually reveals the remaining avengers in an utterly emotionally wounded & frustrated post Infinity War world, the film cleverly picks up the momentum right after that with lots of twists & turns backed up by little & big moments of excitements as well as tears of joy & heart-pounding loss at the end.

Kudos to the director-duo Russo brothers, the writers and everyone involved with this absolute epic conclusion of the saga that ultimately pulled off the most satisfying ending this whole story arc could have.

Can't figure at the moment how they or anyone will be able to top this one in coming years.",10
The End of a Saga. The End of an Era.,25 January 2022,,8
"Good but below expectations, disappointed by an average story line",26 April 2019,"Avengers Endgame for me, was good but not so good, it was fun but not so fun, it was exciting but not so exiting, it was emotional but just a little bit. From the get go it tries to establish things that are confusing. For me it broke the #1 code that made Marval movie great - don't break your own fictional universe's rules. Endgame breaks quite a few rules and I ended up at the finale waiting for explanation which never really fully came.

I did enjoy the movie, and at parts the movie delivered what it promised but it's by no means as great as I was hoping it would be.

For years we fans have speculated and analyzed what would happen. Take any simplest of the theory and that is what happens. It left me disappointed. It left me disappointed that Russo brothers went with a average at best storyline.

Infinity War was sort of a standalone movie, a person with basic knowledge of previous movies could watch it and enjoy it. This one, you need to know the entire plot until now. Even then this movie is not as good as the previous avenger movies.

Endgame is good and has lots of fan service but the humor seems forced and the story seems questionable. It might have worked if it didn't have such grand expectations but since it does, it is still a disappointment for me.

Verdict: 6/10",6

SET THE BAR REALLY REALLY HIGH,25 April 2019,"You probably heard people reviewing comic book movies with the line 'this scene is ripped straight out of the comic book page' and with endgame it couldn't be more true. i mean the story is touching, the battle is EPIC, and the jokes are funny. and i promise you there are SO MANY SURPRISES in this movie and they're all GREAT! i have some crazy hope and really high expectation and marvel exceeded all of them. you wont feel that its 3 hour long movie because its just so good! thank god i already had another ticket on sunday. the only critics i'd give is that i came 5 minute late :(",10

I Loved it Three Thousand,28 April 2019,"What can I say but ""Thank you, Marvel""?

I really recommend you to watch all MCU movies before Endgame, because they make this experience unique for the fans that is with them since the beginning.

About the movie, I'm thinking for a long time to write an adjective, but the only one I can think for now is ""wordless"".

I had never seem something like this, even in Infinity War (which I thought it was insurmountable) we didn't watch such a deep and emotional movie like I just watched in Endgame.

All characters have a great end in the film. I can say that them fulfilled the role just the way it should be. We don't see individual throughts, but a team working together to save what they love more.

It was a pleasure to be part of this, because all of us has something in these Marvel movies. Maybe grateful is the word to discribe the feeling right now. I claped my hands when the screen turns black and I know that a lot of fans, like me, did the same!

Thank you, Marvel for the Gran Finale.",9

Simply Amazing,27 April 2019,"Avengers: Endgame ends the 10-year story arc with a big bang. I'm still in shock by all that has happened. ENDGAME WAS UTTERLY ASTOUNDING. This movie is one of the best, if not the best, Marvel movies of all time. The initial reaction walking out of the theater was: ""That was crazy awesome, and I can't even begin to process what just happened."" After a few hours, the sadness begins to set in as you realize that this is the end of a beautiful story and era. Wow. What an ending to go out with.

I remember seeing the first Avengers in theaters in 2012 and being starstruck by what I saw. I promptly looked up when the next huge superhero team-up would happen, and I've been patiently waiting for this moment all these years.

Props to everyone involved with Endgame. I can't believe they kept themselves from revealing spoilers for so long.

Just amazing.",10

A modern city - Atlanta,6 December 2021,"Many of the wars in the Avengers series were fought in New York. However, the actual shooting took place in Atlanta far more than New York. The headquarters in Avengers - End Game was also discovered by audiences. It was the US headquarters of Sany Heavy Industries near Atlanta.

In addition to being the shooting location for this movie, Atlanta as the ""New Southern Capital"" , it is the headquarters of many multinational companies such as Coca-Cola. Furthermore, there are also Olympic Memorial Park and Stone Mountain Park for outdoor activities.

Atlanta has four distinct climates. In winter, it is warm. In contrast, it is hot and humid in summer.",9
10/10 recommend,2 May 2019,"It gave us everything we needed. Heart, humor, action, closure, and a perfect ending. A series can only go on for so long and it was beautiful. Infinity War set the bar high and I'm sure we all expected tremendous satisfaction, although the dialogue was more excessive in Endgame- there was a lot to be explained. I think this was the best result and it's naive to expect more character development, fight scenes, or explanations... there was a 3 hour period and it was executed to the best of its ability. A huge triumph for the avenger saga and I loved every minute of it.",10

A great MCU film but A hot mess.,28 April 2019,"I would say Endgame is in the top 5 of all the MCU. It's cgi was brilliant and at times the story was beautiful. There are three things that I feel endgame didn't do well. Thor. Although ragnarok worked with the action comedy, I feel they went to far in endgame. It feels like they where almost mocking the character and at every turn you had no choice but to laugh at him. Thanos. How can thanos without the stones be so strong? I understood in Infinity wars his power but even with the stones he got crippled but storm breaker but suddenly in Endgame he's even stronger with Thor seemingly unable to use storm breaker in the same way. I feel the whole time travel although great to look back at 10+ years that brought us to endgame, there was no structure, it all felt messy. I love the MCU and I still rate the film. For me as this is my opinion, had they got these things right it would have been the best MCU film ever. Like I said had some beautiful moments within the story and that helps pull you through the movie.",8

Characters over Action.. and that's a good thing.,24 April 2019,"This is for the MCU fans, a truly heartfelt, emotional 3 hour journey into characters we have grown to love over the last 11 years. It's not perfect, they took huge risks, some I didn't like, others I loved! A Few things to know: It's light on action (until the last hour) In favour of telling a slower story and letting the characters simmer in a scene. Take tissues Don't take a toilet break There are no after credit scenes. Overall I loved this movie. It's a fantastic and satisfying conclusion. 9/10 Where I rank this in the 4 Avengers movies - 1st Where I rank this in the MCU - 2nd",9

Great, Fantastic, Actors, Directors, Camera, Sound, SFX, Music. Alan Silvestri. One of the best scores since Forrest Gump.

The Ending Scene is so full of love. I am really impressed. I was laughing, crying. So much of it. Thank you Marvel Studis, Thx Disney to feature this finale.

People, I love you 3000",10
"A Cinematic milestone you have to see, because...",24 April 2019,"The MCU movies have been not just about the storyline they portray. They were the last frontline of cinema in times of on demand tv shows, at least from my recent experiences at the movies in a rural area of Germany. People setting alarm clocks for ticket sales and sitting through double/triple features after midnight, this is when movie magic really happens for me and I fear that this is the culmination and the end of this kind of cinematic culture. Nothing like this has been done before and it is uncertain if we will ever see such an epic journey of interwoven films again like this.

This is a thank you to anyone involved in the creation of these film, since I am grateful for this experience and always was looking forward to the next chapter in this story. I hope there will be more stories like this to be told on the big screen, but I fear nothing will ever compare to the excitement before watching endgame in the midnight screening. This is what great moviemaking looks like and my wife and I laughed, cheered and cried along the way. Thank you for this masterpiece!",10
What ever it takes! A MUST WATCH,25 April 2019,"What can I say, Epic, emotional, shocks and twists.... No one is prepared for this. The movie felt like 1.5 hours even though was 3 and could have gone for another hour and still flown by. You will need to watch multiple times as a lot happens that will keep you on the edge of your seat, and to process everything that goes on. The ending credits are different to pay homage to the cast and to signal end of an arc spanning 11 years. This movie deserves to knock avatar off the highest grossing movie of all time.

Make no mistake, it was good, just not great. 21 films leading up to this point have built the tension, and what should have been a sonic boom was closer to a car backfiring. At three hours, this is a long movie. While there are moments of great humor and great sadness and great happiness, it also dragged in spots. One would expect it to be 95% action, but they spent a lot of time on fluff. Again, do not misunderstand me. I liked this movie quite a bit, but I wanted to love it, and sadly I didn't.",8

Disappointing compared to infinity war.,25 April 2019,"I must next watched a different film to many on here but let's be honest this is the kind of film that attracts a lot of fanboys and /or rivals/trolls.

My opinion is not biased as I love and watch all superhero films ever since the original superman.

I just felt infinity war was a much better film that didn't mess around, we got into it straight away and the ending was unlike anything I've seen before in a comic based movie. Endgame didn't deliver on many fronts, things like captain marvel playing a big part felt like I was cheated or the whole plan by Dr strange was never fully explained. There were way too many jokes even for a marvel film and one of the strongest characters Thor was the butt of all jokes thought of the film till maybe the last 5 minutes during the big fight.

I think the movie reminded me of how I felt after watching matrix revolution... Just didn't live up to the hype sadly.",8

Slow to start...punching end.,28 April 2019,Dont agree with what Marvel decided for Black Widow ..and no acknowledgement for her! Some Great scenes and twists! All around great! Boo on no post credit scenes!,9
Kind of silly sorry,8 August 2022,"I'm not a big fan of superhero films.. I've enjoyed a few but I'm no fanboy. Seeing men in tights with big letters on their chests just doesn't do it for me. But I do like Batman Begins as an example of some guy in tights still been a good film.. I like gritty and a little dark my super heros. I liked some of the X-Men franchise. (I,II, Future Past..) These were sometimes intelligent and interesting. Sadly to me the whole Avengers franchise has felt like a dumbed down version of the X-Men films.. It's basically a lot of ego centric stereotypes wise cracking at each other and showing off. Sadly that's what I got from watching this. The first hour was terrible. Spoilers potentially! It gets better in the second half for a while. The actors show some emotion! Wow.. some years are shed. The wooden acting still shines through however.. I mean I'm surprised at the high ratings for this film. It seems like everyone a just forgiven the huge plot holes, poor acting and unnatural script writing and ultra predictable stereotypes .. and everything that's bland and wrong with this film... Because... It cost a boat load of money? Has a lot of secrecy around the ending(s)? I actually stopped watching with about 30 mins left.. after the big battle where everyone is thrown together to fight off this guy who by that time we don't even care what happens to him anymore anyway.. it's all just a big mess if you ask me. I really don't get it. So many plot holes and WTF moments? It's just all so wooden.. Like Guardians of the Galaxy but less funny, fun or relatable. The CGI was disappointing. The hulk character had no life in him.. and neither did the actors sadly. Half of the planets population is wiped out by.",6
Too long,14 August 2019,They could have cut an hour and a half of the slow unimportant scenes.,3
The Infinity Saga arrives to its fitting act.,24 April 2019,"Best way to describe a three hour venture without recklessly diving into spoiler territory. The movie excels best at its central element of time travel, which is rather where the momentum is truly its natural best. The characters are all rounded, perhaps more so here than Infinity War. This is likely a fair take on what results now as a quadrilogy than a trilogy. When the action really gets to its peak level, it's almost effortless with the buildup doing every bit of the talking. The most curious turnout is the studio's first ever movie to be well over three hours, which to be frank could have succeeded with more than the overall result in this movie. Just a thought at hand, rest assured the pacing eventually comes to a fitting close that won't underwhelm the overall theme of what's termed the Infinity Saga. The emotion and depth really get to how things play out, also a bit improvised over Infinity War and in the viably greater ways. Got to lose a point for how it uses fan service done right as a sendoff to breeze through the buildup process up to the key parts that make this movie the ultimate conclusion it will be for a long time. My favorite of the Russo brothers' directed movies remains Civil War, simply because it was a Captain America movie of all the flicks back then that really pushed hard to reach a well deserved billion mark. This might get there a little too easily. Duh, but noteworthy. Give or take eleven years and twenty two movies, which as I mention is twice its bargain. Facing Thanos the second time really says something, which is likely all to consider about it.",9
Movie,22 July 2019,Best movie ever and very good movie. My favorite movie ever when it come out on dvd I will buy it.,10
A fabulous journey!,27 April 2019,"There is no other way that an amazing journey like Avengers could've wrapped up. The fire started with Iron Man in 2008 with some marvelous people including the one and only Robert Downey Jr. and director Jon Favreau and ended with the epic piece directed by the Russo Brothers. As Tony Stark quoted, :""part of the journey ended"" and left a legacy to being remembered by so many generations. The movie is definitely a masterpiece of this era which puts us on emotional rollercoaster, enjoy a flashback of the memory lane and a lot of kick-ass stunts. It tattooed our head and heart so deeply that we can never move on from this brilliant piece of jewel. One can only hope that marvel will lit the beacon again in the coming years to sustain this honorable legacy. My advice to all the people, Go watch it, even if you are not a fan of Marvel Cinematic Universe or ""superhero"" movies, you would find it once in a million worthy for spending your money and time both.",10

Only the second movie that I chose to watch for the second time,24 February 2020,"I had been out of the loop over Marvel movies for too long until I watched this movie, then I decided to watch all the previous ones. I have yet to pull that off, but nonetheless I wanted to go back and watch this epic conclusion again with the benefit of hindsight and it never ceases to be so awe-inspiring.

The other movie I watched a second time was ""Interstellar,"" by the way.

This time I'm scaling the rating up from 8 to 10.

Looking back you can't help marveling at the unrivaled labors of 12 years and 22 movies from Marvel Studios. They really did create a wonderful world of their own.

And to remember how naive Robert Downey, Jr. looked in the first ""Iron Man"" in retrospect, compared to where he wound up in ""Avengers: Endgame"" - the giant on whose shoulders everyone else in this Marvel Universe stands - that is something that could not be said even of ""Star Wars.""

Happy trails.",10

Still haven't recovered from the existential crisis this film caused because I don't feel like wanting anything anymore because I feel like it gave me everything I needed. Nothing feels exciting anymore maybe because I won't be anticipating anything as much as I anticipated this for a very long time. So I am just sitting here questioning life, hope I snap out of it soon (no pun intended)

When a film is a culmination of 21 films and about 11 years of hard work, it becomes immune to criticism because then it's more than just a film. This is just an attempt to put my thoughts down in words, show gratitude and say goodbye.

Endgame subverted expectations and got everything it needed to address from the ending of Infinity War right out of the way to kick off the actual story of this movie, which made it quite unpredictable because there was still over two hours left.

Since spoilers aren't allowed, I would say the underlying logic behind certain science fiction elements this film involves might be questionable to some degree but the way they handled it by embracing the light hearted side of MCU and cleverly poked fun at it in hilarious ways which somehow worked, you had no option but to go along anyway especially once the tension filled second act goes into some crazy unexpected directions that kept me on the edge of my seat.

Some may argue the first half is slow or that it's not as inventive as some of the previous great MCU films but they were in a corner after what happened at the end of Infinity War which was nothing short of perfect. This film had to follow through on that and it delivered and that's all I needed.

It also somehow managed to pay tribute to all three first phases and almost every single important character without compromising the story and by weaving all the homages and references brilliantly in exactly the right places. It provided closure to everything they have been setting up slowly over the years and I tip my hat to Marvel Studios for being able to pull that off.

The entire last act of this movie is just COMIC BOOK MOVIE HISTORY and MOVIE HISTORY. I COULD NOT BELIEVING WHAT I WAS WITNESSING. That's all I can say to describe how absolutely insane and balls to the walls crazy it was. I can't come up with words for the things this movie and this universe made feel throughout the years. I honestly feel like my life's over, like I've gotten everything I ever wanted.

And for that, Thank you Kevin Feige, Thank you to the trinity of MCU - Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth and Robert Downey Jr who brought their characters to life and a standing ovation to Russo Brothers who not only made such a massive event work but exceeded my expectations regarding what MCU could be. This universe is an achievement that will go down as one of the most influential achievements in film history.

To everyone involved with the MCU, Love you all 3000. I don't think I'll ever be able to thank everyone involved for how much they have influenced my life and those who will continue to do so going forward. And I can never be too grateful to the man himself, Stan Lee. Excelsior.

I can't rate this because no matter what rating I give, some will say I'm overrating while some will say I'm underrating it. Though I may add a placeholder rating for IMDB.

I hate to say goodbye to this era of MCU but this is goodbye. I honestly can't believe it's been more than 11 years since I first watched RDJ suiting up as Iron Man in the first MCU film. I used to watch that film in wonder and amazement and now we are here with such a massive universe with these iconic characters. MCU will go on but man, I'll miss everything about this era of MCU. Farewell (for now)",7
It is just not a work of art,28 August 2021,I think that it felt like a long film and it really had a predictable ending. Although the film felt long it also felt rushed there was a real lack of thought that went into this film as it really didn't seem to excite me. Generally I would say that the cinematography was poor and the acting was ok at best. For the amount of money Marvel have they really did really make a quality film.,3
HOLY MOLY,28 April 2019,,10
"Perfect, Awesome, Unbelievable, Unpredictable",28 April 2019,This is the perfect ending for the infinity saga as they call it ...I enjoyed every second .. multiple goosebumps... tears ...laughs... it is truely awesome and got no words that could describe how I feel ... loved it so much ...thank you marvel ... thank you so much.,10
Perfect finale for infinity saga and End of Tony,26 April 2019,,10
"""Avengers: Endgame"" Review- The World's Last Hope",18 February 2020,"Is this the end or can the Avengers pull off one last miracle? After a 11 year journey that spans across 22 films for a total of 3000 minutes of screen time, the Marvel saga's final tale is being told (Coyle, 2019). After watching Avengers: Endgame, which is just over 3 hours long, it was very satisfying to see how all of the movies are interconnected into one movie. You will laugh and you will also cry while hanging on every word of dialogue because you don't want the movie to end. Avengers: Endgame is everything that an action hero fantasy sci-fi movie should be by finding a way to give all of the Marvel heroes a role to play in the movie.

The Marvel journey began all the way back in 2008 with Robert Downey, Jr. as Iron Man. I think that Downey expertly portrays Tony Stark who described himself in 2012's ""The Avengers"" as a ""Genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist"" by combining humor, charisma and is an absolute master at the ""one liner"". Despite Stark's many character flaws and personality quirks, he's a good man and you find yourself rooting for him. Even though there are 22 different Marvel movies, there is always a reference to Iron Man/Tony Stark.

Chris Evans, who plays Cpt. Steve Rogers, aka: Captain America, does an excellent job of bringing the character to life. While Captain America is the oldest Avenger, he is also the strongest. Possibly the only person that could lift up Mjolnir, the hammer of the God of Thunder, Thor. I believe that Chris Hemsworth was destined to play the role of Thor. Standing at 6'-3"" tall with long blonde hair, he is a perfect match to Thor from the comic books.

""Avengers: Endgame"" takes place 5 years after Thanos' ""snap"" that wiped out 50% of all living things. While half of the Avengers are scattered across different locations around the globe, as well as the universe, trying to pick up the pieces after ""The snap"", most of the remaining heroes are headquartered at the Avenger's base in New York. However, some of the heroes have seemed to have lost their sense of identity. One is mad at the world and is trying to rid the world of the remaining evil, while the other has turned into a slacker with a beer belly.

One constant in the Marvel ""cinematic universe"" has been Stan Lee, the creator of the Marvel Universe. Sadly, Lee passed away on November 12th, 2018 and did not get to see the joy that ""Avengers: Endgame"" brought to the world. However, across the 22 movie arc, each director has found a way to give Lee a small but memorable cameo in every movie. ""Avengers: Endgame"" is no different. ""Endgame definitively closes a few chapters in the Avengers saga in highly satisfying fashion. It is a tremendously entertaining intergalactic trip"" (Warner, 2019, p.1).

While ""Avengers: Endgame"" is no longer in theaters, you have multiple options to enjoy this masterpiece of a film. Marvel is now owned by Disney and can be viewed on ""Disney Plus"" for a monthly subscription of $6.99. You can also find ""Avengers: Endgame"" on Blu-Ray and DVD at any retailer for $19.99. For an overall score for ""Avengers: Endgame"", I would give it ""11 out of 10 stars"". It's just that good. This movie is rated PG-13 for sequences of sci-fi violence and action and some language. I think the audience needs to prepare for an emotional roller coaster while watching this movie. I think that it is helpful to understand the movie better if you have seen all of the other Marvel movies as all of the other movies are interconnected. I think ""Avengers: Endgame"" is an excellent buy because it is a fitting conclusion to the 22 movie story arc.",10
Too good to put into words,5 May 2019,"This was an emotional roller coaster, extremely good. It had just the right amount of comedy, sadness, excitement, and everything in between to make you remember this movie forever. I would definitely recommend you to watch, although I have to say, what the hell were you all doing with your lives if you still didn't watch it yet.",10
Great movie!,11 October 2019,This movie is amazing! Its a must see movie! Please watch this movie it has so much fun and exciting things in it.,10
"Very good, entertaining movie with flaws",26 April 2019,,7
WOW! Thank You Marvel!,26 April 2019,I LOVED every minute of Endgame. Thank you for such an amazing ride!,10
All good things come to an end.,25 April 2019,"A brilliant ending to the Avengers series. It doesn't top Infinity War which is simply in a league of it's own, but it does do it justice. It's a slower pace than Infinity War, but the build up is worth it.

I knocked off a few stars for what they did with Hulk and Thor, who were two of my favourite characters from the franchise, especially after Ragnarock.

It's a shame that there won't be another Avengers movie after this one, but I guess all good things come to an end.",7
Good,28 April 2019,"A film with a great closure but that does not surpass its predecessor in terms of quality refers to it, although it is true that we should not let go of fanaticism the film is good but it is not to be considered a jewel or that it is above several cult movies",4
This review will be absolutely spoiler free so no worries,25 April 2019,"Again this is no spoilers at all, even no hints. First off I was spoiled a lot of aspects of the movie, so knew what I was expecting and still really really enjoyed it. The story and how it plays out is incredible and really clever. Rather being like infinity war with a large focus on Thanos and action scenes, this is definitely an avengers movie (the original 6 mainly) that is very character and relationship orientated. There isn't as much action until the third act and my god, the third act, imagine what you hoped for it and times it by 1000000. It's absolutely glorious. The second act was also so well done and such a fun thing to watch and piece together. The reasons why I have given it a 8 is because there are some issues I have with it, for a movie with such stakes I wish they took it a bit more seriously, and I think was too humerous and light hearted for what's going on, which meant significant tonal shifts for me personally. Also I feel like the first act was a little slow, although i perfectly understand why, and it was necessary for the story they were trying to tell but I wish there could of been an extra action sequence or something in the first act, as just a little extra. Also a scene or 2 in the third act, were a little disappointing and forced. And although there certainly is a lot of fan service in it, it makes the movie more enjoyable, although a little cliche/predictable. Overall I enjoyed this movie, it probably would of been a 9 for me if I wasn't spoiled anything. I enjoyed it just as much as infinity war, although very different movies (pacing and story wise). Would recommend for all MCU fans, however it doesn't hold your hand and you need to have watched previous movies in order for it to make complete sense, which could be a turn off for casual movie goers.",8
On your left,1 March 2024,"This movie takes you for a ride! It picks up near immediately after Infinity War, and then does the time jump, which is very satisfying. You're able to see how each character copes with the change post-snap, which greatly humanizes them.

Let's be real though, the movie hit epic levels with THE SCENE. It still gives me goosebumps.

The time travel was done well. There weren't loose ends to manage, and the story does have an ending for these characters. The problem is that the bar may have been set too high. It's unlikely any future phase will ever reach this level of hype or fanfare. We spent years with these characters, and those that follow won't be bad, but just different.",10
Favorite😍,4 June 2020,Again a best movie from Marvel.. But it has some drawbacks but also a It will be a beautiful experience to watch our superheroes..,10
A worthy conclusion to a legendary adventure,28 September 2019,,9
Amazing,27 April 2019,"Had everything you could ever want from a film, emotion, comedy an amazing way to tie up some historical storylines",10
Hands down the best!,28 April 2019,"Avengers: Endgame is better than I ever could have imagined!!! A love letter to the past decade with so many Easter eggs, just an absolute joyride. The last half hour is a spectacularly jaw-dropping, emotional, goosebumps-filled piece of cinema unlike anything we've seen thus far!! (A forever Christmas gift for my 10-yr old self)

Marvel closed this out by pitching a perfect game!! Just ... wow. This 22-film story arc has been an amazing ride! Thank you, Marvel and everyone involved with the making of these films! #ThankyouAvengers",10
Over hyped yet worth remembering,20 February 2020,"I should say , Avengers Endgame could have been far better and way more incredible if around 20-30 minutes were trimmed off from the runtime that includes the first half scenes . 181 minutes is too much time and it is disappointing to see that half of this film is not worth it . A binding of 22 films and ending is satisfying and the best ever but , for the movie as a whole 8.5 IMDB (as per now) is over rated and the credit goes to MCU fans who got swayed with just last 40 minutes of the film for which I think they came . This movie was not better tham Avengers Infinity War .",7
I waited long to write this review but,8 May 2020,"I kind of couldn't like it better than the infinity war at first but now that I keep finding myself going back to watch their time jump scenes and watching the final battle scenes over and over and over again, I realized something... infinity war started with a bang - Yes, Loki dies, Thor and Hulk we powerless but cut to Dr. Strange and Wong - casually going out to as happy friends before Hulk shows up - Cut to Tony - Strolling around with Pepper discussing the wedding, Peter Parker on a school bus with his friends - Scarlett and Vision enjoying freedom - You get the point - Infinity War was about the Avengers regrouping which is why the theme of the movie was bright and why we all loved it so much but Endgame was about reclaiming which is why, the dreaded dark theme in the movie makes us feel so bad - our favorite superheroes defeated and which is why, I find myself looking for scenes after they get back together in their final attempt to undo what has been done and despite what the haters say here, that final battle will remain the biggest moment in cinematic history!",10

Avengers: Endgame Will Marvel!,25 April 2019,"Where to begin. This movie was everything I wanted and more. It was unpredictable, kept me guessing and was full of action and character driven moments. The story was the perfect conclusion to the characters we know and love and the epic storyline built over eleven years. There was only small nitpick I had about the movie, but to reveal it would spoil the experience that is Avengers: Endgame. The acting is phenomenal. Robert Downey Jr, Chris Evens, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Mark Ruffalo and Jeremy Renner all give 110%, as does the supporting cast. The way this film wrappes up the journies of the characters we've known for so long is beautiful. All of the characters could not have had better endings. The film is heartbreaking, exciting and well written. It's deserves all the praise it's getting. See this film, now! Before someone spoils it and because it needs to be seen on the big screen. Trust me, the climax is one of the biggest and most exciting climaxes put to film. This is the best film in the MCU, the best film of 2019 so far and will most likely continue being so and it is one of my personal favourite movies, I enjoyed it that much. 10/10. Book tickets as soon as you've finished reading this. It'll be the most exciting 3 hours of your life.",10
Amazing!!,26 April 2019,"It just blown my mind up. I screamed till i cant no more. I cried, laughed, shooked. Endgame just broken the mold. Best superhero movie ever",10
You MUST see this!,27 April 2019,"What a way to end this phase of Marvel. Comedy, Action, Drama, Romance, and Sadness all rolled into a single movie. Great job marvel.",10
Nice,27 April 2019,"The movie isn't about fight but it's about the struggle they have made for each other and the familys who have been vanished. And they actually did ""whatever it takes""",10
2019,8 August 2019,"Im happy to see finale like that , goodbye Avengers ;(",10
The greatest movie of all time,2 August 2019,"Most electrifying scenes of all time, most emotional scenes of all time, greatest action, hardest goodbyes, comedy, tear rolling big six credits... and so much more. I just wish the writers gave Iron man and Thor their own great moments to shine during the fight with thanos.",10
Marvel movie series ends with a whimper,27 August 2019,,6
Cinema at its best,6 August 2019,"I can't say more than that I have enjoyed every single second! People and even some critics can't stop complaining about the length of this movie, which doesn't line up to the fact that this is the end (together with far from home) of an era containing 22 movies! What else is there to say? Well, I didn't have such a great time in cinema for a year, the last one was Infinity War;) To come to an end: Every emotion was affected by this movie, literally EVERY emotion! From joy to anger, over to fear, ending in sadness...This is one of the best movies in the past 7 years! So if you haven't seen it yet: Go ahead!!!",10
Avengers Unexplained,26 May 2019,,7
Time travel is such a lazy way to write stories,6 May 2019,,4
Less than memorable,2 August 2019,"This movie was a very strange experience for me. It wasn't bad but also was not good either. There are constant attempts at humor that feel forced and unnatural (most of Rocket's dialogue feels that way). The whole movie felt like it was saying good-bye instead of building the story. The action scenes were pretty bad. Sure, lots of special effects and great CGI but again, there was nothing supporting any of that. It's the worst Avengers movie and while it might have generated some box office revenue, the story and dialogue are completely forgettable.",
"The Legacy in ""Endgame""",29 April 2019,"Robert Downey Jr.'s gaunt Tony Stark records his message to his beloved Pepper Potts, played by Gwyneth Paltrow, aboard the disabled spaceship last seen in ""Avengers: Infinity War"", ""Part of the journey is the end..."" After 11 years of Marvel movies, Directors Anthony Russo and Joe Russo's ""Avengers: Endgame"" signifies the end of the journey with laughter and surprising poignancy. At one point holdout Avengers leader Natasha (former assassin Black Widow), played by beautiful soulful Scarlett Johansson, refers to the Avengers as ""family"". That resonates for us, too. For the last 11 years these screen Heroes have become family. We care what becomes of them. Do they find peace? Do they discover love?

""Endgame"" screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely patiently crescendo to the showdown with seemingly omnipotent galactic villain Thanos, motion captured by malevolently measured Josh Brolin, whom defeated the Avengers, by wiping out half of all life in the universe using the Infinity Gauntlet possessing all 6 Infinity Stones. The climactic battle is visually astounding, and oh so costly. Yet, what inspires most about ""Endgame"" is family and heart.

Most of ""Endgame"" takes place 5 years after Titan's Warrior Thanos decimated half the population of the universe, including about half of the Avengers. Here less is actually more. Where as in ""Avengers: Infinity War"", way too many Superheroes resulted in the kluged narrative, focusing on the surviving Heroes: Chris Evans's Captain America (Steve Rogers), Robert's Iron Man, and Chris Hemsworth's Thor, displaced God of Thunder, empowers the story. Brie Larson's all-powerful Captain Marvel charismatically emerges as the new Avenger. Too bad the Russo's couldn't leverage more for Brie. Then again, that might have been narrative saturation.

Where ""Infinity War"" was so dour and so self-absorbed, ""Endgame"" has a wicked sense of humor. Mark Ruffalo's glasses wearing civilized green giant Hulk taking selfies with adoring teen fans is hysterical. Critical to restoring their fallen Heroes in Thanos's aftermath, the surviving Avengers utilize time travel in hopes of preventing Thanos from possessing all Infinity Stones. In the hilarious expository exchange regarding the effects of changing past and future events: ""This is not 'Back to the Future'."" No, it's not. And I busted out laughing.

The human narrative touches in ""Endgame"". The distinct strength of the Marvel Universe Movies are its Actors. Travelling back to 1970, Robert's Tony Stark meets his estranged Father Howard, the genius engineer, played by earnest John Slattery. Howard has no idea that he's talking to his future son, because his wife is about to give birth. Robert's authentic compassion moves. Tony hugs Howard, who expressed doubt about being a good Father, saying, ""It'll work out."" Then you realize that was the only time the two had ever hugged. On that same trip back, Chris Evans's Steve wistfully gazes at Peggy Carter, played by captivating Hayley Atwell. Peggy is the forsaken love of Cap's life.

Chris Hemsworth's Thor travels back to the Norse legendary Asgard to retrieve an Infinity Stone. He encounters his mortal Mother Frigga, the powerful sorceress played by beautiful strong Rene Russo, on the day she's to die. In a subdued joke, rotund Thor has seen better days, since failing to dispatch Thanos in ""Infinity War"". His loving Mom tells her son that she knows that he's suffered. Looking into his eyes Frigga says, ""The measure of the Hero is being true to yourself."" Amen.

Really, ""Endgame"" is awesome, because of heart. In that Karen Gillan is understated power as the mostly machine Nebula, daughter of Thanos. Her Father had contested her against sister Gamora, played by brilliantly strong Zoe Saldana, for his love. Tortured and devalued Nebula, becomes ravaged with vengeance upon her Father. Yet, Karen makes us believe that Nebula's soul is worth salvation.

Yeah, at 3 hours and 1 minutes ""Endgame"" is the restroom challenge. I kid, well sort of. Despite all that, I loved ""Avengers: Endgame"". It's the poignant, whimsical end of the journey. At least for me, the Avengers are my fictional Hero family. Like the characters on the wide screen, we all experience suffering, profound loss, joy, and triumph. In life, like Chris's Cap says, ""Take your baby steps... Move forward."" I for one shall remember the Avengers in my heart.",10

Why people are giving this movie 1?😡,27 March 2021,What is wrong with people.they are rating 1 or 2. I mean this is the greatest movie of marvel. Those who are rating 1 on this movie are probably hater or they don't have better taste on movies.,10
One of the best movies if you're a true marvel fan,12 June 2019,Many of the 1/10 reviews or people that say infinity war is better is the people who don't understand most of what is happening or haven't seen all of the marvel films or have not read any marvel comics. Endgame is a true treat for hardcore fans such as I am as I have seen every marvel movie and have read many of the comics. It is full of satisfying scenes that have references to other marvel movies so the people that say endgame is a waste of time don't understand the references to older movies. Endgame is one of those movies where you really have to watch previous movies to find it fun. If you have not seen all or most of the marvel movies or have not read any comics you will feel bored and confused of the plot as most of the movie is fan service to marvel fans which is a 3 hour special with all characters from every marvel movie which will satisfy true marvel fans.,10

This film is definitely worth the watch Marvel have outdone themselves with this film congrats to Marvel for making such an amazing legacy and an outstanding conclusion.",
All the low ratings are by nerds,6 August 2019,"I'm assuming the low ratings are by comic book nerds. This movie was amazing. A laughed out loud, by myself, many times and cried a lot. I'm really surprised by how much considering this is just a block buster super hero movie. The thing is, I actually like movies. And I know they are entertainment. Are there holes in the time travel plot? Sure, but who cares. Just use your imagination to fill in the holes. Or don't think about it too much. It's not real life folks. I'm just grateful I live in the exact period of time where movies like this are possible. It's amazing what they can do. Imagine someone from the 1920's or 1820's saw this? Be grateful. This movie was a masterpiece. If you want less plot holes, watch a film, or read a book. This is a movie. And a damn good one.",10
An emotional rollercoaster,8 August 2019,This is everything I needed from Endgame.a Lot of people who only watched it for the hype won't be able to enjoy the movie as much as we Marvel do. It gave the characters the ending they deserved and oh my God that last fight scene is a freaking masterpiece. I don't think any movie will ever make me feel the way I felt while watching Endgame in a decade.,10

""Avengers: Endgame"" is absolutely Action Packed, Amazing, Epic, Brilliant, Masterpiece, and it's way more fun and better than Infinity War, like every Audience and I thought it would be. It had all the action, humor, and had very emotional scenes. The Russo Brothers, did way better than Joss Whedon. Why? Because, it's ""A must see"" and a perfect Marvel Studios film, for the whole entire audience to watch, but I Can't tell you what happens, or what happens in the end or who's coming back to life, because in the end of ""Avengers: Endgame"", no one, and I mean no one, or anyone, can guess what's gonna happen :) And Now it's shattering Box Office Records around the World! :) I loved it 3000 :) and it's far better than the first Avengers movie, and Avengers: Age of Ultron, and Avengers: Infinity War.

The BEST movie of all time!!!!!!!,29 May 2020,,
BEST MOVIE EVER. THANK YOU MARVEL. I COULDN'T AS FOR A BETTER MOVIE,16 June 2019,"After the decimation of half the universe at the hands of Thanos, the Avengers must fight to restore order to the universe once and for all in the conclusion to an 11-year, 22-film-long journey through the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

If you've ever felt like all these shared universes and year-long franchises have been leading up to something, then, well, it's here. The moment fans have been waiting for since 2008 has finally arrived, culminating an already enormous franchise in a gigantic finale that's everything I wanted it to be and more. It's the most shocking and emotional movie out of the entire superhero genre, but also brings all the excitement and fun Marvel knows for while having a more somber tone than most Marvel films as well. This movie brings eleven years of cinema in a cinematic event that pays off every minute dedicated to waiting for, watching, and discussing Marvel films over the years. If you think you could get away with only watching a few of the previous films before this one, then you're wrong - in order to truly grasp the substance of Endgame like the movie wants you to, you are required to watch every film from the Iron Man, Captain America, and Thor trilogies to all the other connected adventures such as Guardians of the Galaxy, Doctor Strange, Ant-Man and the Wasp, and Captain Marvel, and of course, the first three Avengers film. After all, it has been an eleven-year adventure and, to be honest, the Marvel Cinematic Universe has been the center of popular culture for as long as I've known about it and have been following it. In case you don't know, I've seen every Marvel movie in theaters since 2012 and this franchise has always had a special place in my heart. This movie is one that everyone can love, but simply going to see Endgame without any prior knowledge won't bring you as much joy and emotional payoff as that which so many fans in my theater, including myself, experienced when watching this film. The performances are all spectacular, including Robert Downey Jr. and Chris Evans reprising their beloved roles as the leading names of the Avengers, which have easily become the greatest characters in modern cinema. The movie does a wonderful job continuing every character arc from the previous films but still takes characters in unexpected directions, which may be why characters like Hawkeye, Black Widow, and Thor are such highlights as well. Every actor wonderfully reminds us why they were so perfect from the role, including the previously mentioned actors, as well as Mark Ruffalo who is always so enjoyable as Bruce Banner. Not to mention Paul Rudd, who is perfect comedic relief but also delivers a terrific performance overall as his character Scott Lang, better known as Ant-Man. Another character I was very impressed by is Nebula, who originates from the Guardians of the Galaxy films and is most deeply connected to Thanos from all the characters in the film. Nebula's arc has always intrigued me though many have overlooked it, and the script takes advantage of what makes her great very well and transforms her into a real hero, as opposed to her darker, villainous personality when her journey began in Guardians of the Galaxy. Telling you who else is in the film would already be a spoiler, but every cast member that does appear in the movie perfectly utilized and is very much welcomed every minute they're on screen.

Remember when Avengers: Infinity War came out and everyone called it a cinematic landmark because of the incomparable scale and stakes? Well, Avengers: Endgame succeeds at topping that scale by creating something even more unimaginably enormous and climactic. Moments fans have awaited for years and buildup waiting to be payed off, it's all rewarded here in scenes you would never think to picture in your head but finally can. Audiences will continuously clap and cheer as the past films are referenced and heroes do awesome things you've always wanted them to do. This movie made me react like no movie before, and I had a huge smile on my face in some scenes that I just couldn't get rid of. Even after twenty-two films, Marvel takes unexpected directions that you wouldn't have thought of but still remain true to the long-lasting story arcs. This results in an emotionally surreal experience where you cannot tell what will happen next, or if Hollywood can ever top such a glorious event. The way Endgame handles its story serving as a climax of eleven years of cinema and as a 3-hour movie lover's dream, well, it convinces me that this is the peak of filmmaking history here. Every movie in history has always promised to ""up the ante"", but after Endgame, it's hard to see how the scale, stakes, and weight of this film can ever be topped. But that's not a bad thing. Maybe it just means that we lived in the right time, to witness such a grand phenomenon unfold in front of our eyes, and that we'll be able to tell those who come after us of the adventure we went on with these characters over the years, and the conclusion of their stories that we see here, wrapped up terrifically in one of the greatest superhero movie endings of all time, which in turn helps make up the greatest superhero movie, and one of the most astonishing action movies and blockbusters put to film in this day and age.

Avengers: Endgame is a cinematic event that must be witnessed on the big screen, marking the end of an era for Marvel but one that still exceeds expectations with fantastic writing, emotional value, nostalgia, and visuals and set pieces that will be remembered for the rest of however long superhero and action movies continue to be made. Thank you, Marvel Studios, for making such a sensational universe and making the experience of being a fan an unforgettable one. I'm sure more people can agree with me on that than Thanos can snap away. You've definitely already heard of Avengers: Endgame and now that you know why you should see it, what are you waiting for? 10/10",10
What a blast - but...,24 April 2019,,9
Avenger Still: Endgame,26 April 2019,"Picks up 22 days after the climax of Infinity War with Iron Man and Nebula stranded in space and the others baffled as to what to do next. Antman re-emerges and they consider a new possible way forward.

Fabulous conclusion, full of wit, sadness and wonder. Everyone is great, the effects are to die for and a very well produced line is drawn under phase 3 - let's hope phase 4 is half as good.",9
A satisfying conclusion to an 11 year-long story,24 April 2019,"This was nearly perfect. Trust me. It is the best film the MCU has to offer so far. As a fan of the franchise for nearly a decade (around two-thirds of my life, I am 12), it really left me satisfied with the conclusion of the stories I've been following for most of my life. I still remember my obsession with Iron Man 2 and Captain America: The First Avenger (primarily the latter) when they first came out when I was very young.

All the storylines I've been following for the better part of my entire life so far getting wrapped up (for the most part) really put a smile on my face. Infinity War was one of my favorite movies when it came out. I was mesmerized by the amount of material packed into those two and a half hours of runtime, but Endgame put all that to shame. The three hours of runtime gave the movie a lot of leeway with the plot, and it put all that to good use. It almost felt like two or three movies packed into one.

It does have a few flaws, however (although not severe enough to remove a star). A lot of different things were happening at once, leaving me somewhat discombobulated, although not too much. I won't dock any stars because of this, however, as the ending more than made up for it and some of my discombobulation may be accredited to the loud (yet admittedly fun) theater (as me and my friends were watching the first screening in the whole city).

Overall, I'd say this is a ten from me. You'd be doing yourself a favor if you watch this, even if you haven't watched any of the prior movies (even more so if you have watched even only just a few of them).",10
I've reached the Endgame,24 April 2019,"I was pessimistic and fatigued with Marvel in the past few years, but Endgame is the most enjoyable movie since the original standalone films way back when the MCU was first being set up. Where Infinity War was lacking in terms of tension, Endgame picks up the slack, with tightly bound scenes and interesting twists and turns. Characters act in logical ways and it is simply a joy experiencing and sharing in their time on screen. This was a far more fulfilling experience than I expected and I was really won over by the fantastic acting and the meticulous attention to detail in every scene.",9
Perfect,24 April 2019,Perfect just one disappointing thing is that there was Fortnite in the movie :(,10
Above average,30 April 2019,"As the conclusion of the current MCU, it does a great job. Everything ties together well. Wouldn't be surprised if they had this whole movie script all but finalized 10 years ago. Even opened a few new possibilities of future story lines. Mildly disappointed with how Captain Marvel was utilised.

Aside from the MCU stuff; as an actual movie, I had far too many problems with it. From certain fight sequences, to one dimensional characters, to forced diversity, to pacing issues.

TL;DR Great MCU conclusion, decent movie",7
BEST SUPERHERO FILM OF ALL TIME,16 May 2023,,10
Beautiful to watch but poorly paced and too long,29 April 2019,Think that summarises it. Look the plot has the odd nice twist and some of the jokes hit home but honestly three hours with this sort of pacing is a struggle. Think I'd have preferred to watch it at home.,6
Se muestra lo que promete,26 March 2021,"La película es bastante entretenida, muestra lo que dice que mostrará y como dice que lo hará pero no avanza de eso, siempre se muestra como una película totalmente fans service y para culminar esa era está bien pero siento deberían hacer algo menos para fans y hacerla como el fin de su era.",3
CGI can spoil a movie,27 April 2019,"So much wrong with apparently the Endgame (we will have another 4 movies before the end of the year I bet) when will producers /directors realise that people want a realistic movie not actors prancing in front of a green screen. Surely they should of finished with the last movie not drag out another (and another, and so on)",

This movie is good. I give it a 7,4 but IW was better (I give IW a 8,9). The first half of the movie is kind of slow, the second half is faster.

You need to have seen a couple of marvel movies before you can understand what's going on in this movie. Or you have to have read the superheroes backgrounds and/or powers.",7

Endgame is the event movie of a life time ! it is superior to Infinity War for sure and Endgame fly's by the 3 hours feel more like 2 it's just that good and I can't wait to see it again plus please go in spoiler free it is so worth it there are so many surprises that were deliberately left out of any trailers .",10

Endgame is everything wrong with today's cinema,7 December 2020,"Constant stupid jokes, annoying cgi, fake deaths, predictable outcomes, product placement, no sense of danger, self indulgent ending, idiotic fan service, brainless action, and cliche-ridden idiocy is the best way to describe this film. It is fast food for the brain. If you want to take your kids to a fun movie, skip endgame, take them to Ford vs Ferrari. It may be just as sad at times, but it is based off a true story and has great acting, intelligent humor, a fantastic script, and heartwarming moments. It is enjoyable for everyone, and it doesn't have to be as idiotic as this trash to get people to enjoy it. Scorsese is right.",1
Great Fan Service Acceptable Story.,6 April 2020,,
It goes for the heart.,29 April 2019,"First off, I'll just say that you should put aside any fears that its three-hour run-time might be down to a lack of pace, for 'Avengers: Endgame (2019)' moves exactly as it needs to and it really does fly by. It's not too fast-paced, though, as it takes the time to make sure its events have an impact, which is greatly appreciated. The story, which is shrouded in secrecy and - on my part - shall remain so, is actually quite bold. It never feels like it's under any pressure to move in a specific direction, constantly evolving in natural and, even, somewhat surprising ways. It may take a few small leaps in logic, and generally require a bit more suspension of disbelief than is usual with this sort of stuff, but it never breaks its own rules. Every decision the filmmakers make is for the benefit of the narrative, even those which gloss over - and, thus, retrospectively highlight - some of its (admittedly fastidious) unanswered questions. None of these possible, and only very slight, 'plot holes' even matter, though, primarily because the affair is so much fun. It also takes a lot of risks, being as far away from 'cookie-cutter' as it can. While it may lean towards some elements that long-time fans of the overall franchise might have seen coming, it always presents things in fairly unique, unexpected ways and consistently puts importance on character above all else. This is, as usual, what really makes the feature work. Even when things are at their biggest (and, trust me, they get big), you're never far from a smaller, often more satisfying character-revealing moment. The major characters here are more well-rounded than in 'Avengers: Infinity War (2018)', despite the fact that there's almost as many. This includes, thankfully, Captain America himself, who was somewhat sidelined last time; in fact, he's perhaps the main player this time, alongside Iron Man. Some characterisations are also unanticipated and will almost certainly be polarising, but they're certainly appreciated - even if only for the risk. The antagonist is a little weaker this time as he's a bit more traditionally 'bad guy', but he's built on a more-than-solid foundation and is as imposing as ever. Marvel have made no qualms in calling this the end of an era - the so-called 'infinity saga', to be more specific - and it really does feel like a culmination of this (over) ten-year journey, especially in terms of the 'main' Avengers. It's certainly a film for the fans and it isn't squeamish about it. It's incredibly satisfying, to say the least. It's also incredibly moving in a number of key scenes. You'll experience pretty much every emotion a movie can give you. The whole thing is slightly strange, helped immensely by knowing very little before going in. It's almost difficult to describe, in a way, but its effect is actually quite profound. I suppose it takes a while to 'come to terms' with. I don't think I've fully formed my opinion on it just yet. Don't get me wrong, though. It's great. It's more than great. It's a new kind of cinematic event, the kind of story only possible with a twenty-one movie backlog of character histories and audience investment. The more I think about it, the more I like it. The visuals are stunning, the CG is seamless, the action is spectacular, the characters are superb, the scale is staggering, the scope is substantial, the stakes are serious and the story is simply splendid. It really is something. 9/10",9
A 9 only because of the ending,28 September 2021,"Characters I hate captain marvel such a lame character she is sepose to be the strongest,c'mon,what a load of bullp*ss.

The rest of the characters was awesome especially Tony Stark aka iron man he stole the show as usual and of course Thor and so on...

Story The ending made me cry😭😭 so yeah that's all.

Comedy Only few jokes landed especially Thor's but most of em was lame.

The bad thing about this movie was that after I watched it a few times it got so boring and I only watched it three times. The story made less sense and the jokes just got so more bad. This is definitely not the best avengers movie just because it's the last one doesn't make it the best.

Yeah so that is my review. Great on your first watch but bad after your second or third.",9
Part of the Journey is the End,28 April 2019,,10
Best comic book movie,16 August 2019,"Avengers endgame is the end of the infinity saga and it is the perfect ending. I may not be good with words but this movie was amazing! I am seeing it again tomorow for the 7th time! It is a little slow in the first hour, but it makes up for it because I am invested in these characters. I am happy with what they did with Thor and hulk because it makes sense in the context of their character ark. Thanos in this movie is not as good as he is in infinity war but that was the same with the heroes. Captain America for example was not very good in infinity war but now he is amazing in endgame. People like infinity war for the villain, and I think people should like endgame for the heroes. After all, these are superHERO movies!",10

Brings It Home Knocking It Out of the Park,28 April 2019,"All I can say is that I've never been into the comics but this sets such a high bar maybe I missed out? I'm one who would rather watch the movie it's safe to say. Seriously this is the ultimate escapist celluloid brilliance I've witnessed in over 50-years of movies. This film is the masterpiece of the genre. What a cast too. I think after some settling I will actually feel inspired to go through the entire franchise again knowing this carrot is at the end. No criticism of any kind can I think of. Truly excellent to the point even if you're never seen anything Marvel you should step up and see Avenger's"" Endgame.",9
"A movie that makes you and the whole theater clap, laugh, and cry like babies....",28 April 2019,"Satisfying 3-hours in which you go through a lot of emotions. And the best feeling is when you sit in a theater with NO empty seats, and everyone goes through the same thing like you do. We all clap when there's a satisfying scene that explains or goes well with all the references in the past. We all laugh out loud at MCU's clever and silly jokes. And we all cry when there's a sad thing happening (don't want to spoil you so that's all I can say).

I guess that's all you need to know to understand that it's worth it to see the movie, and definitely more worth it to see it with other fellow MCU fans. It's been 12 hours and I'm still not over the movie yet, keep talking about it. Thank you Marvel for a successful movie series. Thank you for giving us years of awesomeness. You have made and ended the journey with extraordinary storytelling. Thank you!!",10
Touched,2 September 2019,"After following the Marvel films for more than 10 years, it was a beautiful 'end'. The movie starts with a slow paced emotional tone and catches speed as the story goes on. Some of the goodbyes given to the main characters were heart touching while others were heartbreaking.",9
The best one yet for me,11 February 2020,"Just watch this movie. Not really been a fan of the Avengers series because it's been repetitive, same Heroes, same action, but this last one i found very entertaining and for me the best one.

The story gels together well,but there is a lot more emotion coming from most of the Heroes which shows their still human inside and sort of makes you feel the character more. The main thing about any movie, if you dont connect to the characters, it will not be any good.

The people whom make these films from writers to special effects must be Aliens, because they are brilliant , intelligent beings to do something like this, i mean you got to be someone special to do such a massive movie like this and keep it all together and so many stars.

Please bear this in mind when you watch a movie like this, how amazing the people who are involved in this.",10

An amazing achievement in cinematic history! 8/10,15 February 2020,"Review: After watching Infinity War in the cinema, I was pumped to see Endgame, so I avoided the rumours, even though I knew that the Ant-man's ""so-called"" time machine would play a big part in the final showdown, and I rushed to the cinema when it was released. I must admit, I did fall asleep through the whole beginning of Endgame because I found it boring, and the constant chatting got on my nerves, so I wasn't really interested in the ending. Now that I have watched it in the comfort of my own home, in other words, I can pause and rewind it when I want, I thoroughly enjoyed it. The beginning was basically the build-up to an epic ending, which was put together extremely well. I couldn't work out how they were going to cover so much ground, especially as there was a lot of characters with there own personal reasons to take down Thanos, but now that I have watched the whole film through properly, I can totally understand why the writers and directors made this 3hr extravaganza the way that they did. There were some sketchy parts in the storyline, like what actually happened to Gomorrah, were the hell was Nick Fury and why didn't they revive Vision, but the epic action scenes towards the end made up for it. The cleverly written script brought humour and intensity to an, somewhat, impossible situation, and the various twists made it a joy to watch. It didn't actually seem like it was 3hours long, which is a good thing, and it was brilliant to see all of the superheroes battling together to the very end. The visual effects were second to none, and the sad ending was unpredictable, but I hope that we will get to see some of the MCU again soon. I know that the die-hard fans were questioning the ending, especially when Captain America gave Falcon the shield, but we are yet to see the true meaning of that decision. Anyway, it's definitely a film that you can watch time and time again, especially back to back with Infinity War, so it has to get the thumbs up from me. Brilliant!

Round-Up: This movie was directed by Anthony & Joe Russo, who also brought you Pieces in 1997, Welcome to Collinwood, starring George Clooney and Sam Rockwell, You, Me and Dupree, Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Captain America: Civil War and Avengers: Infinity War. As one of the most expensive movies ever made, with the largest Marvel marketing campaign, Disney knew that they had something special, but I doubt that they ever anticipated it's success. The film received praise for its direction, acting, musical score, action sequences, visual effects, and emotional weight, with critics lauding its culmination of the 22-film story. It grossed nearly $2.8 billion worldwide, surpassing Infinity War's entire theatrical run in just eleven days and breaking numerous box office records, including becoming the highest-grossing film of all time. As they filmed the last 2 movies back to back, I can't see another movie of this magnitude ever being made again, especially with so many A-list stars. In Phase Four we will be seeing the Black Widow in May 2020, the Falcon and the Winter Soldier coming in August 2020, a Loki movie in Spring 2021, Spider-Man 3 in Summer 2021, Hawkeye 2021 and Thor: Love & Thunder coming in the fall of 2021. In Phase Five, the Guardians of the Galaxy, Black Panther, Ant-Man, Captain Marvel and Blade will be returning to the big screen, so there is a lot to look forward to. DC better pull there finger out!

Budget: $356million Worldwide Gross: $2.8billion (WOW!)

Yes i agree first part of movie was not that fast but it was great since it built a pavement for bigger building, and also make us feel how heartbroken a man feel when he fails to save his loved once after trying everything. It make me realize the importance of loved one in my life.

As a movie it is perfect. But i am sad that it ended.

I miss the old superhero movies,10 September 2019,"You remember, when kids, how cool it was when Bruce Banner got mad and became hulk without control? How cool the old spiderman movies were (tobey mcguire as actor)? Superhero movies have become franchising for kids, making them more funny than how they were before and they just feel different. I can really see that they are targeting little kids. These movies are NOT anymore for older people too.

This movie was most of the time trying to be funny, sometime being, but the superhero part was just not feeling like it made me feel years ago (even the first avenger movie was cool). That feeling of ""Omg, wow, this gavee me goosebumps"" is gone with Marvel's movies. Hulk that became rational and not anymore the violent Irrational beast? Thor fat and drunk? Other characters just boring. Superheroes movies don't feel like it anymore. They are cute for little kids but I felt really stupid watching it as a 25 years old.",6
Beautiful Symmetry,29 April 2019,"While no rabid Marvel comic book fan, I can say I have enjoyed the Avengers and their journey. From individual films that fleshed out back story to them coming together and being the force needed has been one long memory I will cherish.

Endgame was a true example of how to go out on top of your game. From the humor, the rich characters, the chemistry, the past (heartaches and joy), to the final minutes was a perfect mix and wild ride. It was a bittersweet ending. It did not need ""that particular scene"" to swell the emotions. The whole film was masterfully crafted with extra bits of care within the group.

There were some flubs, sure.They did not detract from the story nor did they stand out. For me, it added to the ""human"" feels. As I said, this should become the gold standard for going out on top rather than a whimper across the finish line. Did not feel like 3 hours, it went by far too fast.

If you don't see any other film this year, get to the theater for this one. It will engulf you and spirit you away from everyday.",10
The whole film was drawn out,27 April 2019,It had a few actually funny scenes a few great action scenes and incredible ending.

One of the best superhero blockbusters ever.,27 April 2019,"""It's not about how much we lost. It's about how much we have left. We're the Avengers. We gotta finish this."" Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.)

Don't believe for a minute that Marvel's Comic Universe is finished after Avengers: Endgame. It may be curtains for archenemy Thanos (Josh Brolin), but a multibillion-dollar MCU franchise has much yet to accomplish. In Endgame, playing with time like a time machine allows the heroes a chance to reverse the ""inevitable"" work of their nemesis to save the world.

The more important time motif here is the three hours of viewing, from which no time machine can spare us. Yet, the genius of the directors Russo and their writers is to make the time go in warp speed, filling the screen with engaging characters and their actors, witty lines not forcing sarcasm but dishing soft irony. The visuals are equally almost underplayed so that it's an organic whole with no element, even music, dominating.

What does dominate is the abiding humanity where love and hate, empire and home, and collaboration not individualism are evidenced in fleshed-out characters and universal themes carefully but never overpoweringly used. The motif of people working as a team for the communal good underlies heroic actions while searching for home and family is the motivating sympathy binding almost all the major characters.

The honor roll includes Black Widow (Scarlett Johannson), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Iron Man (Downey Jr.), Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), War Machine (Don Cheadle), Okoye (Danai Gurira), Rocket (Bradley Cooper), Captain Marvel (Brie Larson), and Captain America (Chris Evans). And too many more to list, the point being these actors have become the heroes; kudos to successful casting directors.

Although I must allow the usual tropes to bind us in sci-fi sympathy, I will always complain that the final act has too many explosions and fist fights (really, with the super tech available to these star travelers, why must the ultimate decider be old-fashioned brute force?). Despite that complaint, I find the movie thrillingly entertaining, a great example for the uninitiated into the genre. I must say there are fewer explosions in the first two acts than usual. Hooray.

For those of us who have seen much sci-fi, Avengers: Endgame has just about all the best qualities we have seen and loved. The humanism dominates:

Good movie but Russo brothers made a stupid mistake that has spoilt the ending.,16 May 2019,,8
One of the Greatest Cinematic Spectacles,25 January 2024,"""Avengers: Endgame"" (2019) is nothing short of a cinematic marvel, earning a well-deserved 10/10 stars for its extraordinary achievement in concluding numerous storylines and character arcs within a single film. The Russo brothers, along with the entire creative team, pulled off an unparalleled feat by seamlessly weaving together a tapestry of narratives that spanned over a decade of Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) storytelling.

One of the film's standout qualities is its ability to deliver a rollercoaster of emotions, making it a true cinematic journey. ""Endgame"" is not only a superhero epic but a poignant exploration of loss, sacrifice, and the enduring spirit of our beloved heroes. The fact that it manages to balance such a multitude of storylines and character arcs is a testament to the filmmakers' storytelling prowess.

What sets ""Endgame"" apart is its emotional depth, featuring some of the MCU's funniest and saddest moments. The film expertly navigates between humor and heartbreak, showcasing the versatility of its characters. From the hilarious interactions to the gut-wrenching farewells, the emotional spectrum covered in ""Endgame"" is a testament to the filmmakers' commitment to delivering a rich and multifaceted experience.

The visual effects in ""Endgame"" are nothing short of breathtaking. The film takes audiences on a visual feast, from epic battles to cosmic landscapes, with each frame meticulously crafted. The attention to detail enhances the overall cinematic experience, making every action sequence and character moment visually stunning and emotionally resonant.

The ensemble cast, including Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, and others, deliver standout performances, breathing life into their characters and adding layers of complexity to the narrative. The chemistry among the cast members not only provides moments of levity but also strengthens the emotional impact of the film.

""Avengers: Endgame"" is a cinematic triumph that not only defies expectations but sets a new standard for the superhero genre. For its unparalleled achievement in storytelling, emotional resonance, and visual spectacle, ""Endgame"" unquestionably deserves a perfect 10/10 stars.",10

It was a solid OK,27 April 2019,Maybe my expectations were too high but in the end this move was just OK. It isn't bad - and it is a must see if you are invested in the Marvel Universe - but it isn't great. Maybe it gets lost in trying to include too many characters or maybe is Disney trying to be PC and intentionally make it try to appeal to too many people but in the end it made it less interesting. It has its crowd cheering moments and is epic - but when the big spoilers happen I almost didn't care. Hopefully Marvel can reboot with the X-men and Fantastic 4 because the current group has run its course.,6

Sometimes they want to be serious, sometimes funny, sometimes emotional. What a mess. They had created a hype by Infinity War and now break all the records. I think all credit goes to Infinity war. They should have to take time to write a good screenplay. I guess they don't take time because the hype will be damaged. And now give the people a crap.",7
so many issues,26 April 2019,"The storyline being absolutely terrible is almost unrepairable. However, they do try and fail. The bjg problem is it's finally clear the choppiness and flow are off due secrecy and too much outsourcing. In order to obacure the plot, different companies are awarded different CGI scenes without ever being told the whole enchilada so that they can't leak anything... Of course this method requires there to be a very strong movie plot to begin with or you end up with chop suey. This movie has a few moments of good laughs and one liners... And that's it. It's a total and complete failure.",1

Epic ending for the last decade,24 April 2019,"Part of the journey is the end. We will be ok without you, now rest. Just cannot stop crying though.",10
Most definitely the most anticipated film of the year.,24 April 2019,"Avengers Endgame is the conclusion to 11 years worth of MCU build up. A 3 hour long epic superhero adventure packed with eye candy action and emotional moments that suffers from a few minor inconsistencies in story and characters. The promotional material has been incredibly vague and therefore I'll keep it too with this review too to not ruin the fun. After the 'events' of Infinity War, the Avengers are forced to reassemble and take on Thanos (Josh Brolin) once more. That's all I'll say about the plot. I was genuinely surprised with the direction that was taken for many characters. Unlike Infinity War, the heroes are in front center this time. There were genuine arcs that made me love and feel for these characters yet again and all of the actors were fantastic. Robert Downey jr, Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Mark Ruffalo and Chris Hemsworth are at the centre of this movie and there characters were all the best, emotional and surprising for me. Especially Ruffalo lightened up the mood with a comedic performance. At this point the chemistry and comradeship between the Avengers is undeniably the best part of these films. Just seeing these characters on screen talking and interacting was truly amazing. The conversations and relationships they share with each other is vital to the films success and it absolutely delivers. The humour is on point, the dialogue snappy and real and the fight just as brutal and significant as before. All other actors too gave very effective performance but I will admit that there were two that disappointed me a little. Brie Larson (Captain Marvel) and surprisingly Josh Brolin (Thanos). I haven't seen Captain Marvel but the use of her character in Endgame didn't do much for me. She had no personality and Larson (a terrific actress) didn't have the inviting charisma that a Scarlett Johansson has. Whilst he stole the show in Infinity War, Brolin's Thanos is merely reduced to a big evil villain in this film. I get that most of the screen time and story was dedicated to the Avengers and that Infinity War was Thanos' movie. But if I'm supposed to judge Endgame as a film on its own, his character definitely felt underused. Some jumbled story parts that best shouldn't be overly analysed aside. Avengers Endgame is an absolutely experience from start to finish. Perhaps the best film in the MCU yet I don't know how they can possibly top this. Wrapped up with a nice bow and tie, Endgame is a satisfying blockbuster for all fans of the MCU and superhero films in general.",8
Just go for a pee before you sit for the three hours,30 April 2019,Easily the best marvel film to exist. You'll most likely cry in the cinema,10
I love you 3000,2 May 2019,"Since we started watching Iron man when we were teens up until now 11 years and 22 movies all those came to success for this movie Endgame. If it is not like this there can't be any other better ending.

Good job Marvel,29 December 2019,"Best movie of the decade. As far as what it achieved and it's impact. Just like Avatar 2009 was the movie of the decade, this movie is too. Now sure it's not a 10/10 it's close though. For a movie that has so much background behind it, obstacles to achieve and a movie before it that was arguably one of the greatest last year, this movie had HUGE expectations... and it sure enough delivered... the box office tells you it all. #1 most money made from a film finally beating avatar... this is a beautiful way to close out this decade off to 2020. And DC has a win up their sleeve as well. Having Joker become the first R rated film to surpass 1 billion. They're both swinging strong this year. Good job marvel I see you, im more of a DC fan myself but I want to see them both succeed and this film deserves its 10/10 I was crying twice and laughing more and engaged.",10
Masterpiece,30 April 2019,"Thank you marvel for this wonderful movie. This movie made me laugh, cry and excited. This Movie is the ending of The infinity saga . It is truly the endgame",10
Perhaps the greatest saga ever told on film.,25 January 2020,How do you sum up the culmination of ten years of cinematic brilliance in two sentences? By simply saying it is pretty damn good.,10
Mostly for Comic Character Fans,9 December 2019,"Watching this movie I imagine screenwriters struggling to write decent scenes while the producers demand a grand, comic-book-style finale to satisfy every fan of every Avenger character. The result apparently succeeds in thrilling long-term Marvel Universe fans. For the rest of us this is a bewildering and mostly tedious mix of melodrama and overwrought FX action

I have watched, and often enjoyed, the previous films from the Marvel Cinematic franchise. So I'm familiar with the backstory of the characters. And I know to come to these movies prepared not only to suspend critical thinking but also to let my eyes glaze over during the prolonged action scenes. To the extent I was able to do this for 3 hours I was rewarded with enough situation comedy to keep me in my seat.

But the melodramatic angst of the characters in the context of the plot is just irritating. Are you pining over the fact that your buddy might not survive the effort to resurrect the half of the living universe wiped out in Infinity War? Do you and every Avenger suffer from Borderline Personality Disorder?

The only protagonists that hold my sympathy and respect for ""keeping it real"" are Tony Stark and Thor. (I'm not sure who merits more credit for that: their actors or their writers.) Otherwise I actually found myself rooting for Thanos: Though we may disagree with his objectives, at least he thinks big and doesn't indulge in ennui. He hews to his principles and does not hesitate to sacrifice himself for them. He is the only true hero in this movie, which makes it a tragedy.",6
what an amazing movie,21 May 2019,What an amazing movie marvel have really use the power of it's own movie if every mistake in the others movie was just to give us these amazing moving picture then I will give all marvel movie he same rate.,10

Too much of nothing,1 May 2019,"That is a typical example of a movie trying to squeeze juice out of a story that falls short. X-men finished their old-cast franchise so much better, and darker, and better (sorry did I say better before...), yeah much better. Endgame is simply not up to par with the rest of the Marvell movies.",3

The biggest snap back of all time,30 April 2019,By the time Avengers: Endgame (2019) still fresh in my mind I can say that this movie is one of the best well spend 3 hours in my life and the best conclusion to the first chapter in the MCU history. I can't wait to see how they outdo all of this in the next 10 years,10
Don't believe the one starred reviews.,9 August 2019,,10
Simply perfect,21 May 2019,,10
It can't be any better.,24 April 2019,"What a perfect ending for avengers series, very emotional and enjoyable to watch, for the events some could be a pit better but it's very good overall.",8
entertaining and at times exhausting,17 August 2019,"This story-arc wrap-up starts with half the Avengers and world in general dead and no way to fix it. Only of course they figure out a way, because that was telegraphed in the last movie, and some of that goes right and some horribly wrong leading to, yet again, a massive battle.

The movie is generally speaking as entertaining as the last one, although it's attempt to use it's time-travel conceit to include every single character from every cinematic marvel universe movie ever made can be wearying, with characters I don't quite remember, characters appearing too briefly to make an impact, and a tremendous number of non-speaking cameos that serve no purpose except to let the audience say, ""oh yeah, them.""

The first half is pretty zippy, with lots of banter and some flat-out slapstick. But the movie also wants to delve into the self-sacrifice theme, so the movie drifts into increasing levels of sorrow.

The movie ends, obviously, with a vast battle, and while it's quite good, with some serious ""wow"" moments, it is the smaller, character-driven moments that truly stand out, like two superheroes battling each other to be the one to self-sacrifice. And while the post-battle weep-fest seems a bit long, the film does end with a particularly satisfying resolution to one superhero's arc.

Endgame gives you the solid, expected Avengers experience. Comedic, dramatic, special-effects driven, and overlong. It's well worth seeing even though ultimately it's nothing you haven't seen before.",8
"A good film, not quite great",29 April 2019,"This movie was so overhyped so it hurt the review but it's a better then average movie. The beginning is slow which is fine cause it usually creates tenseness; however, the movies pacing jumps along to going fast and then back to slow. It's pacing is bad and vary irritating. There were many unexplained plot holes too. Usually this is fine but the audience needs details especially in a lore as deep as marvels. There was too much emotion and it didn't have to end the way it did. Still is a must see and a good film, just not the conclusion we needed.",7
"Heavy on the humor, but heavier on the triumph!",21 August 2021,"Some scenes could have been cut out and the humor was a bit over the top for me in what should've been a more serious and dark film given the stakes. But everything else was knocked out of the park. Pretty much the entire 3rd act/last hour saves it right when Black Widow and Hawkeye get to Vormir. From that point on it's near perfect Marvel material. Emotionally and action-wise with our favorite heroes, THIS is what the fans have been waiting for going on 11 years. I left the theater twice satisfied.",9

when over the top is just right,24 April 2019,"Greetings again from the darkness. In what was originally titled ""Avengers: Infinity War Part 2"", we get the much-anticipated conclusion to the most recent 22 Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) films ... specifically Phase 3. Regardless if you are a deep-rooted fanboy or a casual viewer, you likely know the questions heading into this finale:

Can the Avengers defeat Thanos? What role will Captain Marvel (and her pixie haircut) play? Will those who died in AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR be brought back to life? Will Tony Stark/Iron Man make it back from drifting in space? Who will survive this final battle?

We knew this one had to be big, and in fact, it's colossal/humongous/monumental ... whatever your preferred adjective might be. And you can rest easy knowing that all of the above questions are answered quite clearly in this 3 hour epic from co-director brothers Anthony Russo and Joe Russo and co-writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely (the same directors and writers behind AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR and a few other MCU entries).

Marvel has excelled over the past decade plus by combining interesting characters, understandable story lines, visually stunning effects, and clever humor. This finale offers all of that and more. In fact, it's difficult to imagine a more perfect ending to this galactic odyssey ... and I don't offer that praise lightly. From the use of Traffic's classic ""Dear Mr. Fantasy"" and a gut-wrenching opening scene that yanks us right back into that feeling of dread provided by 'Infinity War', we know we are in for a ride that is quite a bit more somber and even more emotional than what we've come to expect.

The fallout from the Thanos snap is clear as we catch up with Black Widow, Captain America, Thor and Hulk. Each is dealing on their own terms, and while the Banner-Hulk merger is quite something to behold, trust me when I say, you've never imagined seeing Thor in his current state. This marks Chris Evans' 10th film as Captain America, and he is front and center through much of the film - as is, in a bit of a surprise, Karen Gillan as Nebula. It makes sense given her tie to Thanos, and Ms. Gillan holds up quite well in the spotlight.

Since the previous and speculation has been on time travel and the Quantum Realm, brace yourself for a bit of convoluted talk about how that works, but that's the closest thing to a negative I have to offer - and even that is offset by numerous punchlines at the expense of BACK TO THE FUTURE and most every other time travel movie ever made.

The theatre was packed with Dallas area critics and industry folks, and there was a significant amount of cheering, applauding and more than a few sniffles. Yes, this one will take you on an emotional journey as well as a visual one. It has a tough/emotional beginning and a tough/emotional ending. These are characters we've gotten to know over multiple films ... and you should know just about every major or mid-major character from every Marvel film makes an appearance, as do numerous minor ones. It's quite a remarkable reunion. And yes, the brilliance of Tilda Swinton as The Ancient One more than offsets the Pepper Potts scenes.

Creator Stan Lee does get his final posthumous cameo (good for more applause), and there is a 'women's movement' moment that seems to be Marvel's ""we hear you"" statement. Much of what we see is ""inevitable"", but as the Avengers assemble this last time, we are there to laugh, cry and gasp. This is what happens when 'over-the-top' is 'just right'.",8

"If youre not a specific avengers fan, this movie is boring",2 May 2019,"I haven't nt seen all the Marvel movies, but I've seen some - the Iron mans, the Ant mans, Cpt Marvel. I enjoyed them. I thought I'd go and see what the fuss was about. However this, is so formulaic, ridicilous and boring I couldn't take it for the whole film. I walked out after 2 hours, and it felt every bit as long as that. If you're not a huge Marvel fan already, you may well not like this film, because I feel it's somewhat self-indulgent. It's like an effort to squeeze a bit more money out of fans.",2
A worthy finale of the Avengers franchise,29 April 2019,"To make things simple, this movie is exactly what everyone wanted it to be, including myself of course. It's a great follow-up of the ""Infinity War"" which was simply astonishing and left room for sequel as it manages to maintain the pace, quality and excitement of its predecessor throughout its entire length of over three hours. It manages to be so dramatic, filled with action like every other installment but also very thrilling. You're always kept glued to the screen, waiting for the next thing to arrive with no room for boredom. The way it presents its ideas, its story but especially its action scenes is simply unique. As you can expect, all previous Marvel characters return to the scene with their great actors, which their job flawlessly regardless of the situation.

It's one of those rare movie which keep me excited from the first trailer, which generates interest even when it isn't released, which makes me search for the best place in a cinema the moment it appears just to see it as soon as possible. The great part about it though is that it didn't disappoint in any way. Although pretty lengthy, it provided a satisfying watch with a good conclusion to the franchise. I couldn't find almost anything against it, thus the only thing I can do is to award it the maximum rating that it deserves.",10

Dissapointing Reviews,7 September 2019,"""I created this account only to give this movie a 1"", or ""I give this a 5 rating but am voting it a 1 just to lower the undeserved high rating"", and of course all the comedians and trolls and the holier than thou of moviedom that give various reasons for trying to adjust this movie's merits, or lack thereof. These are the kind of disappointing reviews I am writing about. Stop adjusting and come to the realization that you didn't get what you wanted from it. Others did.

Here's what I think. There was a good mix of action and dialogue. You know, dialogue, the part that tells the story? The CG and non-CG special effects worked for me. The story was a little weak. Time travel is a subject that is still fiction, so I feel no need to try and pick apart the theoretical inconsistencies. Some make the comment that there was too much going on in trying to bring the whole MCU into this movie and that the idea may have been a bad one. Now this is the kind of comment that is useful in a review. I won't say more, since just about anything else could be a spoiler. It was a good 6 out of 10, so I am giving it a 6.",6
A once in a lifetime experiance,12 August 2019,"I am a big marvel fan. When I saw infinity war's ending I was immediately excited for this movie. This was easily my most anticIpated movie of the year and probable of all time. When tickets went on sale I got some for the midnight premiere immdiately. And somehow dispite my high expections this movie destroyed them and created a even better movie then I could have imagined.

I loved every second of this movie. Even the first act were most people have complaints I loved. The second act is better then the first but man that final act is just masterpiece. Every cast member from beginning to end is amazing with Robert Downey Jr and Chris Even's being standouts. And thats not easy since I think everyone gave their best performance here and are all able to draw emotions from you. Now some directions charectors take will be not suite everyone. In fact how the avengers deal with the events of infinity war isn't gonna go well for everyone. But I for one loved it. Lead to a few cheer moments. But if you wanna talk about cheer moments man that final act. No spoilers but I wanted cheer at many moments. Two moments I nearly jumped out of my set. But while it's mostly laughs and smiles when this movies wants you to feel man it'll make you feel. If you've been a long time fan (you've probable already seen it but anyway) you will choke up I know I did and I feel no shame admitting it.

If you want max enjoyment out of this film. Watch the rest of the movies. I know it sounds demanding but it's worth it. Cause you'll understand meaning behind stuff. I saw it with my dad and the two moments I nearly jumped out of my seat over he was thinking ""Ah ok"" so yes do watch the other movies if you haven't before you see this one.

In the end Avengers: Endgame is in my opinion is one of my favourite movies of all time and the best marvel movie to date and I dought that will change. I know I didn't say much about the movie but I'm trying to be spoiler-free and the trailers show like nothing of the movie and thats what I based my can I talk about this ot not kinda mind set. But I can't describe how satisfied I was. This truely was an end of an era and I all I can say is I am so glad to be apart of it. To follow these charectors and become connected to them and then to finally see the conculsion thia masterpiece of a story was more then worth the wait.",10

Love 3000,24 April 2019,"It's hard to rate this movie in any fair way. As a movie in itself it's maybe not the most fantastic thing you've seen, it's no Pulp Fiction, Her or Forest Gump. But as a movie in a series of films this is amazing. The different stories that has been told through Marvels characters all come together here in a perfectly balanced way. As all things should be.

Seeing grown up men and women laughing, crying and cheering for their favourite hero is something I find fascinating and it's hard to find this kind of interaction in the cinemas. I simply love it.",10
If only there was another way,24 April 2019,"I came into this movie expecting so much and boy did it deliver. I was 22 when iron man first came out and and ever since then all the avengers characters have felt like a part everyones family who love the mcu avengers. I dont know how i feel now happy sad empty all in one. I need to watch it again to digest it first time watch you are sitting there going wow wow wow!!!

This film is definitely the one of the best i dont think we will see a film this emotional big for a very long time. The way film is presented is awesome one scene u might be crying from sadness or happiness and it will cut to the next and you will crying from laughter. It gets a big thumbs up for its comedy. Its drama was on point every one knows something big is going to happen to our avengers but it doesn't matter you still can't prepare yourself. It like losing a pet whos been apart of your life for 10 plus years.

As the saying goes all good things must come to an end if only there was another way.

Enjoy this movie",10

A lot of expectations expected for this movie,2 May 2019,"Let's face it: It was the most anticipated movie of the XXI century, thus a lot of expectations for the makers to reach, which is not an easy task.

I would say they did it, they even surprised us, But was it the ending the way we want it? Mostly yes, and in my opinion it's a very good ending.

BUT, the lack of action (imagine my kids 2.5 hours without actions...) and the way they show Earth with supposedly ""ONLY"" half the population should have disappeared but looks like 95% disappeared (half is not 95%) made me remove 2 stars on the 10/10

Is the lack of action exacerbated the movie? No, not for adult as the scenario was well written, but for the younger staying 2.5 hours sitting and expecting action from their favorite super heroes was hard to manage in the cinema... and even for me, though ;) minus 1 star...

No need to say that no one from my family wanted to stay to see the end credits... But in the end of the day, every ones found that the movie and the way it ends was good but not that good!",7

The Russo's have wonderfully done it again, with this film out-shining many of their previous films, and many of the other marvel films. This film has the ability to manage a complicated storyline having eleven years and twenty-two films lying on its shoulders, and yet still is able to incorporates stunning visuals, brilliant acting, great dialogue, beautiful cinematography, score, and more. The film is hands-down, the best film marvel has created. It beautifully captures the true heart, love, and pain that these films have always produced for the fans. It is amazing. I myself, will be remembering this one for years.

Enjoy it, you earned it. The long await has finally come.

P.S. I feel like this film is honestly Oscar worthy. Robert Downey Jr's performance is amazing, where he beautifully captures this extensive journey of material in film, which all started with him. His time and effort, which has created this cultural phenomenon deserves praise. Also, the Russo brothers. These comedically genius brothers have positively made their mark in cinema, through this film. If they do not receive a nomination for either best director, or the film isn't nominated for best picture, I don't know what the academy is doing. I know they don't normally go for comic book movies, but this, this is something different.

Have fun people.",10
The way marvel outdoes itself with every next movies,27 April 2019,,10
"Fantastic acting, great story and humour.",24 April 2019,Loved this movie as I have loved all other Avengers movies...bar one..Captain Marvel. So glad she (Brie Larson) was only in it for a short time or I would have scored it less. Loved the humour and the old familiar Avenger Heroes. Chris Helmsworth was hilarious. Robert Downey Jnr was brilliant as were the others.,10
This movie is really masterpiece!,24 April 2019,I can introduce this movie to one of the best marvelstudios films. This is movie really masterpiece!!! I rated this 10/10!,10
"You did it Marvel, you freaking did it! ""Marvelous""",24 April 2019,Such a perfect ending to an epic ride for many many years. It got better and better and found its perfection in this very movie. Everything just fitted and at the same time it was so surprising and genuine good writing and editing. All to the point. Only downside has probably been that you overdid it a lil bit with Thor. Infinity war almost the main character with such a cool curve and in this movie more of a goober. But for the sake of the epicness of the rest of the wild ride I'll forget about that.,10
Captain Marvel unnecessary?,29 April 2019,,7

For every comic book kid and kids at heart.,24 April 2019,"I can say is this was one of the best cinema experiences of my life. I don't think you can top the ending of this movie. My jaw was on the floor, e writhing I've ever wanted in a comic book film.",10
The best movie that could ever happened in this world,24 April 2019,"DC can't even chase the tail of the Marvel, anyone who left a bad comment of this movie must be someone meant to do so, it reminds me 11years ago when I was a kid and watched the first movie of iron man I was attracted by MCU with those wonderful imagination and heroism. This is the best endgame for all these 11years of love I can not explain how I am feeling with my poor English, but this for sure is the best marvel movie ever.",10
"Visual epic, but something wasn't right",26 April 2019,"To keep this short and sweet, Avengers Endgames is one of the most visually pleasing movies of the year next to Alita Battle Angel. But what stops short is the political messages driven into this movie. Socialist activist, people who cry over star wars trailers and folks who say the world will end in 12 years will love this movie and won't miss a beat. But for those who are more attune and aware of forced idealism in entertainment to push across a progressive narrative may find it overpowering and in your face a certain moments. Other aspects left me a little disappointed as well, but not enough to get up and leave the theatre. Also to eveeyone giving this ten stars. Check out their activity and user names. Someone is really trying to boost this movie.",6
An Amazing Endgame,24 April 2019,"This movie is EVERYTHING. There is action, and comedy, and romance. It's a story about family - both gained and blood - and it opens so many different possibilities to the future! I was laughing and crying at the same time. The cast is obviously amazing - but shout out to Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans and Karen Gillian.",10

"Absolutely OVERHYPED garbage, nothing more!!!",30 April 2019,,1
It didn't live up to its hype,26 April 2019,Avengers infinity War was one of those heart stopping movies. It had everything going on and it just worked out perfect. Going into End Game I had high expectations and was sadly disappointed. The movie was very underwhelming. May I even say boring at times.,8
Oh Snap!,27 April 2019,"This movie made me feel every emotion humanly possible and then some. As a huge Marvel fan, not just of the movies, this film took me places! What a rollercoaster ride of emotions and the cinematography was beautiful. A very complex story made enigmatically seamlessly. Thank you to the Russo's! Can't wait to put this on the end of the canon once it's realized to purchase! A must watch in theaters!!! Best version of Hulk ever!",10
Absolute Masterpiece,27 April 2019,"This is the finale the marvel cinematic universe deserves and it is a masterpiece. It surpasses your expectations no matter how high they are. The way they put together everything in place, the comedy, the drama ,the action, everything on point. Thanos - The most badass villain in the history of cinema. The Final act - Perfection. The directors could not have done it better even if they wanted too. Watching it once is not enough.",10
My favouraite hollywood movie,30 August 2020,Best movie i just love it. It the best movie of the decade i guess everyone reading this must watch this movie.,9
BEST SUPERHERO FILM PERIOD,24 April 2019,I am just speechless at this point. There aren't words available in the dictionary to provide justice to the magnum opus that Avengees Endgame is. Kevin Feige and the Russo brothers have just outdone themselves. You could say that infinity war had some flaws in its narrative context. BUT ENDGAME IS THE PERFECT SUPERHERO MOVIE. One of my most favourite films of all time PERIOD. It manages to live up to the expectations of hardcore fans to the maximum and so much more. General movie going audiences will also enjoy this as it is in many ways its own movie and doesn't depend too much on previous installments. Do yourselves a favour guys and watch it ASAP. TRULY A MASTERPIECE,10
This Is Not Just A Movie It's More Than That,14 May 2019,"Movie Is Filled With Humor , Action , Thriller , Deaths And Many More. There Would Be Scenes That Would Make Your Tear Ozzing Out Of Your Eyes.",10
Review Endgame,28 April 2019,"Good but this has the most problems out of any phase 3 marvel film. Time travel is cheesy, none of the acting was EXCEPTIONAL except for RBJ. They didn't know what to do with Thor or hulk but they didn't really focus on them too much so its fine. Captain Marvels character is terrible. None of the time travel stuff makes sense and they keep breaking rules. Why is CA on the bench I thought it created an alternate timeline. When nebula was caught why didn't she GET OUT OF THERE. Your particles still work LEAVE. Why can't Captain Marvel snap the gauntlet, she's the strongest avenger. Anyway it was still good, it's kinda just pros vs cons but it was fun (except for the first two acts).",6
What a journey,24 April 2019,"What a remarkable journey it is for Marvel Cinematic Universe. I don't think anything can accomplish this kind of achievement in another franchise universe. This is indeed one of a kind.

To everyone contributing in the making of this universe, producers, story writers, directors, actors, CGI makers, and everyone involved, from the bottom of my heart, I say thank you very much for the experience, the sensation, the excitement, the wonders you guys brought to the movies..",9
Captain Marvel does not ruin Endgame,25 April 2019,"She is a minor character just like many others we have met throughout the years, helping out in the fight against Thanos.

The movie is at times a little bit slow and dark (also in the literal sense), but is ultimately a worthy final chapter in Marvel's 22-film saga.

There is exactly one 10-second ""girl power"" moment in the movie, so for those who worried that Endgame would become a ""SJW mess"", it isn't.",7
"Terrible, sloppy, and disgraceful",2 March 2021,,1
3D,31 July 2019,First Time i saw the movie in 3D. It was a great experience for me. It's awesome movie. I'm a big fan of MCU.,10

I'm eager to write about this yet I'm also afraid. There's so much to this movie!,24 April 2019,,10
All good things must come to an end...,28 April 2019,"I am immensely honoured to be existing in this monumental era of time to be able to experience the vast complexity and extravagance of the MCU, as it flourished with each subsequent film. It has been one hell of a ride, but unfortunately - all good things must come to an end... and this film met this end with great success.",10
Endgame,3 August 2019,It is a beautiful film and worth watching and has a special artistic touch I swear..... Reda El Alaoui,10
Amazing!!!,20 August 2019,"Best superhero movie created ever it has besrt screenplay, story, action and full entertainment like a perfect package",9
Are Avengers the real power?,19 January 2022,"""Avengers: endgame"" was supposed to become The great final of the biggest series of Marvel films containing all the main characters.

What it really is what we see? I wouldn't name it The great film. Yes, the cast is good and well-known and the picture is fine and beautiful, but it didn't become that great as it supposed to be. The storyline wasn't that different from other films and the end was not such a surprise. So, go and watch it, probably for you it would be The great final.",7
"A ""Marvel""ous conclusion...see what I did there?",15 August 2019,"I am stunned by the 10+ years of the MCU and how they were able to bring it all together. Magnificent! However, I hate Captain Marvel. I shudder to wonder what will come of the MCU under her guidance and direction. Black Widow could have/ should have carried the torch. Please don't make any more Captain Marvel movies. I'm begging you.",10
Only a 7 for the last hour,25 April 2019,Dont get me wrong I did enjoy the film the first hour and a half I felt was a bit pointless but then wow it was amazing so I feel 7 is all it deserves due to the start,7
Just rubbish,8 September 2019,"Three hours wasted, was about as good as declawing my dog and at least I like the dog. The storyline was terrible, and for many blatantly obvious reasons made no senses, to make matters worse it seemed to have more holes in it, than my old gym socks. Yes I know all the good guys weren't going to make it, everyone knew that, I actually hoped a few wouldn't make it, and that's not what I care about, this movie was rubbish it labored three hours to get to the point of dead good guys/bad guys then victory and bang happy ever after for two minutes then over. This is going straight in the never watch again list, unless trapped on a plane in which case fingers crossed for a parachute, but will jump without one.",3
Avengers: Endgame,27 June 2021,,10
An awe inspiring cinematic masterpiece,27 April 2019,"The connections that we have made with these characters all these years comes full circle in this movie and it is pulled off in an incredible, emotional, epic finale",10
An Action-Packed & Emotional Rollercoaster to Be Remembered,18 February 2020,"This was a phenomenol and perfectly executed picture to wrap up a final conclusion to a deserving saga. I could honestly not be anymore happier with the outcomes of this film. It was thoroughly well-scripted throughout the movie with acheiveing to seperate the humour, action and emotions equally. The Russo Brothers nailed the directing and the actors and actresses executed their roles outstandingly. Visuals were cunning all the way. Character developments and sadly send-offs were perfectly done. But most importantly it had its unforgettable moments which stood out and ended this masterpiece.",10
Best movie! Ever,15 May 2019,,10
END,1 May 2019,,10
BEST Marvel movie ever made!,27 April 2019,Great movie got everything movie needs and it very entertaining.,10
Kind of Messy,17 June 2022,"The movie is fun, but the writing leaves a lot to be desired. I was blown away by Infinity War, but this movie was a lot less impressive. The story was over stuffed, some of the plot points didn't make sense, and over all the movie seemed more concerned with shoving in humor and callbacks than with telling a well crafted story. It's enjoyable, but definitely not on par with some of the other entries in the MCU.",7
Good but not as good as IW,1 May 2019,,9
The stage was set for something spectacular and im still waiting for it...,26 April 2019,"Infinity war perfectly meshed the missing components in terms of adding the missing members of the avengers such as the guardians of the galaxy as well as the new MCU addition Spiderman as well as introducing us to Thanos wth a lot of backstory masterfully executed. It saddened and frustrated how it ended but in hindsight set the stage perfectly for endgame which got the creative juices really going with very high expectation set by its predecessor. Unfortunately it got wasted with the Russo brother pulling continuously at the string of the worlds smallest violin turning what should have been a magnificent superhero movie into a nonstop tear jerker. Though I can appreciate the underlying theme of this movie is about dealing with loss and being triumphant at the end.. It seems the former is continuously stuffed down peoples throat for at least two hours.As a poster ealier pointed out its 2 hours of crying, some action and crying again. The climax of the movie was enjoyable though it didn't cover screen time as much as it should have when it was the main reason people came to watch the movie. Theres a lot of things that happen to the movie which either don't make much sense, either happen to quick or just illustrate lazy writing assuming the viewer will fill in the gaps with a lot of cheesy content which gets you thinking 'really'. It almost seems as though they had put thought into how they wanted the story to end but didn't put much creative thought to the journey leading to the climax as simply cobbled whatever they may have left out of the MCU in the previous movies into this for fan service. As an MCU fan I would still advise people to view it as its end of this saga but don't believe a lot of the hype that's on this review board or you will be immensely disappointed.",6
Overhyped,7 September 2019,"More than 3h of ""yes sure..."" BS. The franchise is at its end and CGI won't rescue it.",3

This is one unique movie experience and ever will be.",10
Really Emotional.,25 April 2019,"People might say that the film disappointing and the action scenes were limited, etc from the reviews i've read. the thing is, this movie is really one of the most emotional marvel movies i've ever seen. it's about family, friendship, love, sacrifice, and etc. you definitely have to watch it, because everything you've seen in the past 10 years will lead and be here and you sure don't want to miss it as a marvel fan. also prepare your tissue because there were a lot of minor scenes that even touching.",10
Great super hero movie ahead of it's time,4 February 2020,People who are telling the story was dumb and giving 1 star on imdb.I am telling there the story is best ever done by directo. There was some plot holes for another marvel year movie coming 2020 and next.So time travel story really matters what's happen in end game.Nether the story off othere super heros goes in shadow.That's why everything is connected,10
Expected more,9 June 2019,I was a bit excited for this title given that I really like the previous one but I ended up a bit disappointed... It's often very versatile from one Marvel to another. I found the characters' decision not really making sense in many occasions and the plot ended up not making that much sense anymore I found.,6
Beautiful cinema,3 February 2020,"With the conclusion and a massive success of Infinity War, Endgame is now more hyped than ever. But with that comes reasonable concerns. How can Endgame possibly top its prequel? What could possibly happen that will make Endgame a rollercoaster ride as Infinity War was? Well, I am happy to say, the Russos did it again. They took all our heroes on journeys we never thought we would ever see. The Russos managed to add depth and humanity to every single character ranging from heroes to villains. Adding new and interesting arcs as well as wrapping up certain arcs in such a satisfying way. Masterful movie making.",9

An excellent ending to the best cinematic universe there has ever been.,12 May 2019,"I love this movie not just because there are fan service moments, but the writing is woven together from previous Marvel films and this phase of the MCU culminates in grand style. The fan moments are justified then, because of the writing and the story offers balance. There is no shortage of humor, as you would expect; It has become a stapel to have in a Marvel movie. I can connect with the characters (protaganists) who after losing to Thanos in Infinty War must accept that defeat and move on with that sour taste still in their mouths. This is something most of us have more than likely had to deal with at one point or another in their lives: Defeat and how to pick ourselves up after losing. People can say what they want about the different issues and ""plotholes"" but honestly, ""Avengers Endgame"" closes out this phase in the MCU in such an epic way.. It'll be interesting to see how they should attempt to top this!",9
"Thank You, Marvel",25 April 2019,"This is best superhero movie that I ever watch. The storyline was great and powerful with its emotion weight and great treatment to all the characters. If you think Infinity War is more to Thanos storyline,then don't be disappointed because this is the Avengers movie. The movie also bring us to the journey where you can remember the movie what it's supposed to be. 30 years from now, I guarantee that you will introduce and share the love of this movie to your child or grandchild.",10

The best MCU movie. The theatre I was in went totally nuts. It had spectacular action, it was surprisingly funny, and emotionally captivating. It manages a large roster of well developed characters which are very well executed, everyone gets a moment to shine. Delightful throwbacks to previous outings as well as smartly placed pop culture references. A truly satisfying finale for the 22movie and 11 year story arc which we have come to love.",8

Wut?,1 May 2019,"People have no idea how to review things anymore,they all just put 10/10 because of hype and this is the last of the series..No this movie is the best thing of all time,its NOT a perfect work of art nor masterpiece,in fact its very poorly done and had a pathetic ending. I real waste of my money and time. Things all started going downhill after Infinity War..Thor is a one big giant joke,hes not godly,epic,interesting or manly anymore hes just a big man child. Hulk was always a bit more comical which is fine but now its on this whole new level of stupidity. Ironman is the only one with any character left and yet even Robert Downey Jr has to suffer when pitted against such terrible writing. Things just happen that dont make sense, characters suddenly become moronic and the entire build up of epic moments is taken down into this ultra cringe scene that ruins the whole plot.

The constant misplaced child humor and the attempts to make ever little scene into a Disney baby movie is sickening. Things can't be taken seriously anymore or its too offensive,everything needs to be dumbed down into this childish mush so the general public can clap their hands and drool. I'm really glad this series is over with before they burn it into the ground more..Yet i cant help but think about all the other comics that will be ruined with this writing style..

Are IQs really so low now that this is what counts as a ""good"" movie?!",4

Perfect swansong for this initial group of stars as a group,28 April 2019,This film served as an ode to 11 years of hard work as shown by the excellent callbacks via time travel.

After 10 years, 21 films, nearly a dozen television shows, countless tie-in comics and games and merchandising options and viral videos, and billions upon billions of dollars in earnings, the Marvel Cinematic Universe has become the Holy Grail that every major studio is questing after, usually with little success.",10

The Ultimate Conclusion,14 May 2019,"This was a well thought out, superb conclusion for the culmination of 22 movies in 10 years. It is without a doubt the spectacle of of the decade. The movie obviously deals out tons of fans service, but is still one of the best super hero movies to ever be created.",10
"Script sucks, more like a drama than a good old fashion MARVEL movie",25 April 2019,"The film has no pace besides the big battle that in fact is to short and feels like nothing according to what I expected for a new fight with e thanos

Some character directions of important heroes like Thor and hulk where ridiculous . And these characters contributed nothing to the stories besides transmitting weakness

Also the movie was overwhelmed by overpowering woman and non white characters . I understand the need to give equal importance to every king of heroe but not to the cost of the most importa ones .

Also the script was full of things without logic",6
Predictable & monotonous,20 May 2019,The movie is unlike its precursors unamusing and dull.,3
Avengers: Endgame,16 May 2020,"The last time he met, he knew she was staying in the past, she knew he came from the future. ""Everyone can't be the ideal self,"" she told him. ""It's up to a person or a hero to see if they succeed in being themselves."" They did it, enough. The building of the gods has collapsed and the body has become empty. Since we are different, let's say goodbye. Just because we know life and death, we no longer fear life and death; just because we look down on life and death, we can calmly die; because we love life here, we are still afraid of death; because I know you know I will die, so I dare to love you 3000 times.",9
Marvel's best one,27 April 2019,Worth watching.. an emotional journey with lots of memories.. marvel's best movie ever..,10
Great ending for MCU,28 April 2019,"Pride of MARVEL ... thanks you Russo brothers for such great MCU ending, brilliant events and twist",10
Avengers: Endgame can come across as a satisfying end to the eleven-year series for Marvel fans.,27 April 2019,"Avengers: Endgame is the fourth Avengers film and the newest film from the Marvel film series. The film is directed by the Russo brothers, who also directed the previous Avengers film Avengers: Infinity War.

After the actions of Thanos (Josh Brolin) from the previous Avengers movie, the remaining Avengers have to deal with the consequences of their loss. Still, the Avengers must eventually look for a way to defeat Thanos and see if there is a way to undo his dark actions.

With this fourth Avengers film, the Russo brothers and scriptwriters were able to put a nice end to the eleven-year series of 22 films. The Russo brothers have also done their best to fill the film further with things that Marvel fans would like to see or they provide answers to some unanswered questions from previous Marvel films. For most Marvel fans this film can come across as a satisfactory ending. Although this film comes across as the end of the series, they have left enough free space for the next phase of the Marvel film series. They have already planned some new films and TV series for the future. Although they have these new plans, these new films will probably no longer be able to reach the same level as they did with Avengers Endgame and the eleven-year build-up to this film. Despite these future plans, they do not give anything away for the next phase of Marvel. This Marvel film, for example, has no extra scenes that still appear in the film during or after the credits. In this way, when the film is over and the lights in the room turn on again, you can actually leave the room. The only reason to remain seated during the credits is if you may want to know the names of people who have worked on certain things in the film.

The atmosphere and tempo of Endgame are also different compared to Infinity War, because In Infinity War there were more action scenes and intense events that they managed to play at a relatively fast pace, but still had enough room for humorous moments. In Endgame they have a more dramatic atmosphere after losing to Thanos. The pace can also seem a bit slower, because they are mainly busy processing their loss at the beginning of the film, but also planning what they can do best now.

The effects in the film also look good and credible. This way they know how to convey or bring certain things in this film in fun and creative ways. They must have used a lot of CGI and a green screen for these effects, but this is hardly reflected in the film.

The acting work is also done well. Many actors and actresses can be seen in this film in their famous roles. Most of the remaining Avenger characters are also in different locations or in a different life status than we are used to. In this way, the actors who play these roles have also had the opportunity to present their known roles in a different way. In this film every hero gets his own personal moment to shine. They know for example Captain Marvel, who in her own film was not received equally positively by everyone, in a somewhat better way.",8
Perfect ending to an epic era!,29 May 2019,"Well. Where do you even begin with this one. Obviously I love the movie. Infinity war was amazing, and the expectations were very high for endgame. To me they delivered big time. The way the movie made the characters arcs come full circle, with the previous movies. And the funny Easter eggs only a marvel fan who has seen the previous MCU films. The tone of the film is very dark, much darker than infinity war, which was a very colorful action packed movie. Endgame has very dark lighting. The depressed feeling the movie has the first half, is very effective. THE HEROES LOST. It's interesting, to see that side of a superhero story. The acting is amazing in the film. It's filled with surprises. And the set ups from the previous films pay off very well. I had a very cathartic experience watching the movie. Obviously it was very sad a times. And the whole experience felt like a big ending. Even though more MCU films will come in the future. This was definitely an end of a 10 year era. I highly recommend this movie to every marvel fan! Even though everyone in the world has seen the movie pretty much. I can't wait for it to come out on Blu-ray so I can watch it many more times! One of the coolest most unique experiences I have ever had in a movie theater. I have witnessed history.",9

Nice popcorn movie,24 April 2019,"Avenged Endgame serves as a super nice popcorn movie. But the building-up for the final battle happens way too slow, way too dull. The battle itself is epic but ends too soon in my opinion. Some of the punchlines in the film seem too contrived and almost bored me into tears. The movie tries to dig in all the main characters but fails to convey the depth. With that said, the visual and sound effects do deserve being appreciated in an IMAX movie theater.",6
Booooooring,29 April 2019,What a boring long movie. OK special effects are great. But the story line is boring. Nothing happens in first 90 minutes. The rest of the movie is a lot of fuss about some stones. Boooooooooring! I was happy the long sit was over. I read the reviews here and I honestly do not understand why people are so enthusiastic about this movie.,3
Primary Hero,16 May 2020,"Tony said that he wanted to return to the family and accompany his family, but in the end he chose to come back, because of his responsibility and mission, because ""I am Iron Man."" The US team once missed the date with Carter, missed 70 years with Carter, and later attended Carter's funeral, personally sent his love to the road, thank the director for giving him a perfect ending. Black Widow is noble, heroic, heroic, fearless, and Iron Man are the greatest avengers. Thor and good mother say goodbye, Tony and father shake hands and make people cry. The American team made up for the biggest regrets in their lifetime; Banner and Hulk reconciled; Hawkeye reunited with his family; Black Widow has no family because the Avengers are her family ... The ending is too perfect and too tearful. The scene of the collective return of the ashes heroes of ""Reunification 3"" is magnificent and heartbreaking, and its scale has been increased by at least five times compared with ""Reunification 3"". In particular, the appearance of the ""Women's Federation"" is so amazing that it perfectly interprets the power of women. The eleven-year layout, 22 films, a successful ending in ""Reunification 4"". To borrow the words of Morgan Stark: Marvel I love you three thousand times!",9
MARVELous,26 April 2019,"Avengers: Endgame, being the conclusion to an epic adventure, had to be perfect. Every Marvel movie from the last decade has contributed in making my expectations for this one incredibly high. Heading to watch it, I was as excited as anxious, considering it might not be as good as I thought it could be. However, the Russo brothers have been able to create a masterpiece by putting together every significant element from the MCU. This movie will be remembered, not only by fans, for years to come, whether it makes you smile, laugh, or cry!

Thank you Marvel",10
Amazing,5 May 2019,"Incredible, one of the best films I have ever seen.",10
Just Right,7 July 2019,It can't get any better than this. A perfect end to the story.,10
"Beautiful, Flawed, and Satisfying",1 May 2019,"Watching this movie I was amazed that something like this was even possible! We have come such a long way!

The Endgame was totally worth the wait and lived up to every sky high expectation set for it by Infinity War. This movie has laughs, cries, gasps, and sighs of relief. The last hour of the movie had my jaw dropping. The time and care put into each frame of the movie shows.

Endgame is truly the end....the end of a 21 movie story arc, we say goodbye to some of our most beloved characters as well as further embrace others. This movie truly is the swan song of the MCU. It isn't perfect but as the saying goes, ""there is grace in their failings.""",10
A masterful epic,23 September 2019,"A masterful epic - a true culmination of 22 films that not only concludes the story, but expands upon it. You'll learn more about the other movies while this one unfolds. If Infinity War is the brawn, Endgame is the brains. And wow, what an ending!",9

A ride that will stay with you till the end.,28 April 2019,"Endgame is the best superhero movie ever made. It reaches you in ways that you can't even imagine. It will make you laugh, it'll make you cry. It will make you experience a wide range of emotions without deflecting from the original storyline. With stunner starcast and their amazing performances, you'll definitely be spellbound.",10
The perfect ending,28 July 2019,This film is a very satisfying finale to 11 years of build up. The acting as always is amazing. The film as some great action sequences (especially the final fight). The film is able to combine the comedy that most of the other marvel universe films have and has very emotional drama. Overall Avengers:Endgame is a spectacular conclusion to the infinity saga that also has a lot of great fan service packed in to it and it does not drag even with a 3 hour runtime.,10

Academy Awards Take Notice,26 April 2019,"The film was moving, stunning, emotionally driven, and filled with deep meaningful stories, and authenticity throughout. RBDJ deserves an Oscar nom for this performance, as does the film and its leaders as a whole.

There were sniffles from beginning to end, laughs, claps, gasps, and a tangible optimism and heartfelt camaraderie in the theater.

This film was brilliant across the board.",10
Dumb but fun,2 May 2019,"I am not a big fan of Marvel movies. They are on average pretty dumb, makes no sense, and no internal logic or coherence, and usually ends with a horrible CGI massive and boring battle. This movie is exactly like that. But like most Marvel movies it is also very fun. The first two third of even better than average, the first act being 'The Leftovers' - Marvel edition, and the second act a fun heist movie, but the ending is so by the book and uninspiring that I was quite underwhelmed overall. If you want to see good action - MI6 last year put the bar very high, and this movie was not even close.",6

Emotion is the key !,30 April 2019,"Wow .. ok the story is straight forward ,yes sometimes too much to process and if u think about it you might find flows but the main thing that made that movie great is just how easily it makes you fell every emotion the scene wants you to feel , you want to cry you will cry or at least feel terribly sad u want to laugh , be exited you will 100% . Also the amount of references is a a lot . Honestly I don't think they (MCU) can top that at least on the emotional scale .",10
Epic Finale to the Avengers Saga,27 April 2019,"To incredible fanfare and hype, ""Avengers: Endgame"" has arrived. I am happy to say that the film most definitely lives up to expectations, and offers audiences a thrilling, emotionally stirring, and incredibly satisfying finale to the Avengers saga. While it's not completely perfect, it's undoubtedly a great film and far superior to last year's ""Avengers: Infinity War."" While I know that many people loved ""Infinity War,"" I dissented from them due to the excess of ""filler"" in the narrative that made the film seem simultaneously overstuffed and not completely satisfying--with the exception of the film's ending, which was one of the biggest cliffhangers in modern film history.

The film picks up as the stakes from the shocking ending of ""Infinity War"" are a clear reality. and the Avengers must figure out how to defeat Thanos. I'm not going to say much else regarding the plot, but what I will say is that the film's emotional core relative to other comic book films is what truly elevates it. The action scenes are no longer just entertaining action scenes, but battles with real characters that audiences truly care about and have gone on a journey with for many films and many years now. This emotional core is enhanced by the film's score and cinematography, which are both generally understated yet also beautifully impactful at the same time. The film is consistently entertaining and paced incredibly well, and never drags despite its 181-minute runtime. There are plenty of twists and turns that even many serious fans probably won't be expecting, as the Russos do a great job with trying to subvert audience expectations. The performances are all great, and much of the cast has grown and changed quite a bit from their earlier days in MCU movies. This film is less action-focused than ""Infinity War,"" and that works to its benefit since so many important plot points are generally emphasized over action. Make no mistake, the action (and especially the climax) is excellent in this film when it happens. But ""Avengers: Endgame"" shows us that there is even more to Marvel films than those moments, no matter how thrilling and entertaining they may be. Despite its relatively minor flaws (some inconsistencies and fallacies in its narrative structure,) it's a truly fascinating exercise in watching all of the puzzle pieces of the MCU be put together, and it will be interesting to see where Marvel movies go from this point. 8.5/10

Note: I saw this film in Dolby Cinema. The picture and sound quality were generally strong, but this was not one of the best Dolby presentations I have come across.",8

Perfect ending for the infinity saga,3 November 2021,"Starting off, I would say that it is rewatchable as well as memorable.

True if you watch the movie there are a few plot hole - cause there's time travel in it - but the projects of marvel coming on will surely clear that out.

Plenty of fairy floss but not much substance,24 April 2019,"Can you use the prism of film criticism on a unicorn like the conclusion of a 22 film arc, two parter superhero extravaganza?

Probably not.

But even comparing it with other Marvel films or even Infinity War, this is an indulgent party which overstays its welcome. Like a constant rush of sugar, and some of those sugar highs are gloriously fun, at the end you are ready to say ""Goodbye"" and eager for something of substance.

The major issue is that once time manipulation is introduced, then any existential threat is reversible.

The first hour is ploddingly slow, the cast are good but boy they look tired and Capt. Marvel goes close to stealing the film.

Despite that any film lover will have to see this...an event rather then cinema.",7

Whew,24 April 2019,"Never have I ever left a movie theatre feeling like this, and I can't seem to shake it off me. You can't prepare yourself, even if you think you know what is going to happen next. Never heard a theatre full of Finns crying.",10
It was actually pretty good and enjoyable. But that's it.,2 May 2019,,7
"Good movie, Great wrap up.",29 April 2019,"This movie is a hectic and at sometimes confusing wrap up to 11 years of the Avengers. It's hard to see some of the characters that you love and have enjoyed for a decade leave the MCU. And perhaps watch the MCU end, with the PC comments coming out of marvel studios. It is heavily foreshadowed in the movie and honestly I have no interest in what's coming. However, me and my family thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Although it is not as good as Infinity War. Infinity war set the bar with story, pacing, action, and a cliffhanger that made you want to see endgame so bad that some people even went out to see that very average Captain Marvel movie. The best part about it was that they didn't let Captain Marvel ruin the movie. They let some things into this movie that 10 years ago they would never have. However, since it's the end I won't gripe about that. Good movie, it doesn't need any recommendations because everybody's going to see it. I enjoyed it.",8
Too long,2 May 2019,"Not saying what happened but 3 hours are way too long. There could be easily 30 minutes cut due to long scenes and plot discovery.

Lots of people had to""hit the head"" because of the long scenes.

Just saying",6
Absolute waste of time,19 May 2019,"What a waste of time. I am so sorry for all the Thor & Hulk fans. I really am. Movie makers played everyone for fools with all the hype. Lord of the Rings and Avatar remains my all time favorite. My advice to all those who havent watched the movie yet, please do yourself a favor and wait for the DVD. It is highly likely that you will feel wasted like me, so at least you will have saved the money.",1
Wow,13 September 2019,This was amazing don't think they'll make a film like this ever again I cried laughed all the way Avengers........ Assemble 🤙,10
Cinematic excellence,3 May 2019,Spectacular film. Spectacular performances. Not just a great superhero movie but a great movie all round. The Russo's smashed it.,10
I cried every 10 minutes not joking,26 April 2019,"This will go down as one of the greatest comic book films in history. It's a true blockbuster achievement. The reason I love the MCU is not because of action, it's not because of the visuals, it's because of the characters. I love these characters and truly relate to some of them on a deep personal level. I saw Iron Man when I was 11 years old and Downey Jr's portrayal of Tony Stark has literally been a part of my childhood since that movie. And Marvel has done a really wonderful job building these characters and crafting their stories because this movie was a phenomenal ending. Sure it hasn't always been perfect but I really don't see how you could have ended it any better with the way they crafted their story. It all felt right and made sense. The 3 hours never stalled for me because I was just really invested in what everyone was feeling and thinking. Call me a baby but I teared up every 10 minutes because of a piece of dialogue or emotion a character delivered because it was so in line with what they've been through. By the end, I was bawling even when the credits were still rolling. On a more critical side of things this movie won't be something you can pick up any day and watch on video. Infinity War definitely benefits more from the action and pacing side of things and it's a lot easier to watch because of how fast everything moves. But this is required so much emotional investment that when you throw it on then you know you gotta clear your schedule. There's so much movie in this movie it's hard to really just sit down and not get up during it. There's no room for bathroom breaks unless you really don't care that much lol. So will everyone love this? No. But if you put alot of time and investment into these characters and these movies, and you care about their struggles and the things they've been through, you'll find some emotional pay off in this movie I promise. Cap is my favorite Avenger and I was completely satisfied with his arc in these movies. Much like Infinity War this movie is an experience and one you'll remember hopefully. I'm seeing this again as soon as possible and I would just like to thank Marvel for being a home for my childhood at the movies. I love Star Wars but I never got to experience the original trilogy in theaters. That movie magic and impact was displayed for me in the MCU. This was my Star Wars. Thank you Marvel thank you. 10/10.",10
Disappointed (kind of),24 April 2019,The bar was set really high with Infinity war. This movie is good but there is sth missing. I went to the cinema expecting a spectacular movie and I got a good watch nothing that would be up to my expectations. And I believe many of us who have seen the movie are disappointed.,9
One of the biggest Cinema!,28 April 2019,"If you've been following Marcel cinematic universe for more than 5 years, this movie will probably become your favorite movie, it potentially can be one of the greatest movies of all times , so give your reviews !",10
Truly Epic!,28 May 2019,"Perfect culmination of 11 years of 22 movies in a truly epic movie universe - MCU. After success of Infinity War expetactions for Endgame were very high and there wasn't surprise factor and Marvel srudios managed to pull it out. After IW there were million of questions in the air and this movie answered it all. We all can't get what we want from the ending (for example GoT finale) but for Endgame this wasn't the ending we need but the one we deserve. Every character got enough screen time, expect for Captain Marvel who was hyped for much more, but for sure she had important role and Brie Larson performance before she even knew how her character should do is truly what deserves round of applause. Hulk and Thor characters recieved some backflash from fans but I am very happy to see comic adaptationa of Professor Hulk and King Thor personas. Robert Downey Jr. delivered best performance of his career. There were deep scenes, scenes that left me crying out loud in the cinema, laughing out loud etc. Comedy and tragedy were very well combined and in balance - as all thing should be. Also there were some minor moments that set up the Phase 4 for MCU. Fan service was enjoyable. CGI was amazing and final battle was deserving to be compared to th LotR battle scenes. Plot was amazingly well adjusted, some fans didn't like time travel definition i believe because they didn't understand it, but it is not very hard to understand just pay attention. Also time travel is just a fiction so they can make as many rules as they want. It is a pure 10!",10
The emasculation of Thor,27 April 2019,,7
Wow! Amazing and Captivating,23 September 2019,"Like I said when I reviewed the last film, Infinity War, the Avengers seem to get better with each film (and longer it seems). The Russo brothers have become great storytellers over the last few years, and have been great at keeping the story secret. This film is the culmination of more than twenty films over the past eleven years, and it is extremely epic!

There are some twists and turns in this film that you might not see coming, but are essential to the Avengers story-line. You'll laugh, you'll cry and you'll love this chapter of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. I definitely see this film up for multiple Academy Awards in 2020, maybe even Best Picture; its that good.",9

I audibly groaned at the A-Force shot because it made no sense in the context of the film, and it's pandering to a tiny minority of the community that mocks these types of movies anyway. It's not just male characters that were trivialized by Miss Marvel. All the organic female heroines were also pacified by Captain Marvel, most of all, Elizabeth Olsen's Scarlet Witch. Brie Larson is the toxic element that has contaminated the MCU. She literally ruined exery scene she was in. She is a repulsive human and a horrible ACTRESS!

The whole movie could have been better. If there were no important actors in the film, I would give it a score of 2, but I gave the film a score of 4 because of the presence of lovely characters in the film.",4
Relax People,27 May 2021,"I'm honestly shocked by the amount of negative reviews of this movie, not because some people didn't like it but the by the over the top exaggeration of their expectations of how this series should end. You'd think it was the worst movie ever made and it's no where near that, everyone is entitled to their opinion but I'm not buying the absolute disgust that many are expressing, it had to end there's no way around it but don't bash it because you were expecting something different, the good guys won, you couldn't be surprised by that could you.",10
The best MCU movie,25 July 2019,,9
One of my favourite films,6 December 2021,"My favourite movie of all time. I love every minute of it and I'll be rewatching it many times in my life. The movie brings the franchise back down to some of it's core members to really delve into their unique perspectives on the events of the past film. It gives many of the characters very satisfying endings to their arks, and sets up other characters really well to carry on their legacy.

If you've not seen a marvel movie before, I highly recommend catching up with the other ones first, but this is a must see for everyone.",8

Nothing special,30 April 2019,"Just ordinary, nothing special from this movie with almost 3 hours duration",7
For The Fans,26 April 2019,"I'll be honest and if people hate me, whatever. If you don't love this movie you are not a true fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

This is what we've been waiting for. This is it. It's the perfect MCU movie. It is literally everything we ever wanted and everything we could ever ask for. It's everything. It's the most important comic book movie there is.

It's Marvel's truest identity. You laugh so hard the you jerk out in your seat. You're jaw drops from how shockingly awesome it is. You cry because of the joy fullness you're witnessing. And you cry for a happy sadness that is the ending of an era.

There is not one thing I can think of that would be considered a negative. I can finally rest and watch the sun rise on a grateful universe.",10
Overly long,29 April 2019,"Practically nothing happens in the first 90 minutes, then it eventually speeds up. Usual overly long battle scenes, sone sad moments and enough laughs to keep you interested. Can see more spin offs coming at some stage to keep the money rolling in.",6
Back To The Avengers Endgame? Stupid ridiculous time wasting rubbish,6 May 2019,"No Spoilers This movie epitomises why I no longer pay to go to the cinema. It must be a free ticket and I must be bored. Those are my two criteria. It is therefore quite ironic that this film is boring. Was I not clear in my criteria. I said ""I must be bored"". NOT I want to see a BORING film! I quite enjoyed Infinity Wars to some extent but this film was just plain stupid. It must have been written by the children of the directors. It's that bad. I tried to tolerate this film as much as possible, started falling asleep then pinched myself and thought, ""what tf am I doing here?"" and walked out!",1
Wow.,28 April 2019,Wow.wow.wow.wow.wow. The culmination of 22 MCU movies leaves you just saying wow. They did it. They pulled it off. Thank you.,10
The perfect conclusion to the Infinity Saga!,2 July 2023,"For a conclusion to the 21 film Infinity Saga, Avengers: Endgame does the impossible and perfectly finishes the saga and wraps up the story in such a perfect way that it's hard to find fault with it. From seeing how all the characters are coping or should I say struggling from the fallout of Thanos's snap, to them all banding together ""One Last Time"" to triumph over evil, it's a film that I can happily say is perfect. Although Marvel movies constantly get criticised for being ""not real cinema"", this is a film all ages can sit back and enjoy with someone for the kids as well as the adults. Knockout performances from all the cast for Robert Downey Jr, to Josh Brolin. In summation, a beautiful Comic Book film that I can sit back and say ""this is why I love superheroes""",10

Endgame is the exact opposite. Back to the cliche terrible jokes, no character development. Focus on the worst actors, almost no screen time for all the most talented members of the new marvel cast.

"A SOLID, EPIC AND A MASTERPIECE FOR THE HISTORY OF MOVIES",28 April 2019,"Every marvel movie in the history gives us the best feeling as a fan since the beginning. There are times that it will give you sadness and happiness. But, being a marvel fan changes every aspect and perspective of one's life. It gives inspiration and motivation to the people who needs it and to those people who's strugging in life.

AVENGERS: ENDGAME - A final masterpiece to all marvel fans. It will give you mixed emotions, sadness, happiness then go back to sadness then happiness again and sadness. It's like a rollercoaster ride watching this epic conclusion. I don't really know what to say, i just felt SPEECHLESS after watching it. I cried for like 5 times in the cinemas and at home. I really can't get over it, just wanted to cry the whole time. I love everything about this film and it surpass all of my expectations and it is SOLID, EPIC AND A MASTERPIECE. No doubt, this is a movie of the year and the best movie of our history. Also, i am planning on watching it again because it's worth everytime and every moment of your life so i'm highly recommending it to everyone not just to all marvel fans, but to those people who wants to experience the best cinematic moment. Lastly, ENDGAME is EVERYTHING no dull moments, it is epic and solid, i have no doubt just love everything. Plus the cast and characters are the BEST, I REALLY LOVE THEM SO MUCH. THANK YOU AVENGERS!

This film does everything right, from the action to the comedy, the emotion and above all, to the fan service.

"Uh? Kinda underwhelmed actually. Overall, confusing. Audio problems?",26 April 2019,"For the entire first hour, I was really straining to hear the dialog. I stepped out and asked the theater manager to turn it up and ... maybe they didn't. But my sister (on the other side of the planet) said it was the same thing. Did the producers intentionally make the first hour super-quiet to get us to ""lean in"" and pay closer attention maybe?

Audio problems or not, by the end, I was really confused with so many questions ... and didn't feel super-motivated to watch the whole thing again to figure out all the little plot holes that were left untidied. I guess I'll have to wait for the Honest Trailer version to come along and explain everything... :)",7

Amazing end to an incredible journey,27 April 2019,,10
"Perfect as a farewell, but slightly flawed as an action film",2 May 2019,"End Game is pretty hyped as one of the best movies. And it is a great movie. The directors succeeded in connecting bits and pieces from the past and the present. While making all actors shine and draw the viewer in a hurricane of emotions. But as a result, the movies pacing feels messy, slow, repetitive and fragmented.

That doesn't hurt the movie, because it's greatest strength is in the actors, mainly Tony Stark who has the superpower to carry this movie by himself. Further there is the fanservice to include almost every relevant star from the past many movies. Unfortunately, I was hoping for a high octane action movie with compelling fights. Those fights where there, but they were quick, messy, chaotic.

This movie's biggest sin is absolutely not that it is a bad movie. It's good, but not as good as Infinity War, and that's a shame. All flaws aside, End Game is an emotional roller coaster, that works as a worthy goodbye to not only some actors, but a complete sage.",8

Just wow,24 April 2019,Before I saw the movie I was little worried that all the hype gave too much expectations for endgame. My worries were pointless. It is hard to describe how good the movie was. It had all the things what makes a movie great and it was fastest 3 hours ever. Best film I have ever seen. I have always been a huge marvel fan and now I am so proud to say that the movie was everything I wanted and more.,10
way too long,21 September 2019,"Maybe it's better to see Infinity War (2018) because it do picks up what is left of that particular flick. Clocking in over 3 hours it was for me way too long to watch.

Maybe no-one will understand me but 3 hours it has to be good. And it do has it moments building up to the fight towards the last part of this flick but it also has a lot of boring moments and moments were they are talking too much.

I's towards the last half hour that it really becomes what you're waiting for, the endgame. As said, it's not all that bad but the irritating conversations of Tony Stark made me yawn a lot and even reach for the remote control.

Nice to see that Spiderman is involved sadly we do know by now that it could be a once in your lifetime experience. DC and Marvel coming together, not for Disney anymore. Money makes the world goes around.

Get ready to cry like a baby,24 April 2019,"This movie was everything. Many people don't understand when you're invested into fictitious characters so much but the writers clearly do. They wrote the characters in such a human way it's amazing. Even the godly characters suddenly felt vulnerable. In all honesty, I cried like a b*tch I mean waileddd. Numerous trolls popped up in the internet and declared their hate of the movie but they're obviously trying to seek other people's attention and have that one minute fame thing. But after every negative comment I want you to think of this: this movie took character development to a whole new level, it took shock factor to a whole new level. It's been hours since I watched this movie yet I am still in shock and tears. The fact that a film can have this much effect on someone is crazy ,yet, it does. This is because the way they portrayed the characters is so phenomenal that one can't help but completely fall in love with them. If you are like me and you love these characters then I suggest you take a box of tissues with you. I have never been this saddened by a movie scene.",10
"Brilliant scifi, brilliant filmmaking",16 March 2023,"The conculsion of the arc set up in the first three phases of Marvel is, to say the least, without a doubt the best MCU film to date. That is no small feat.

Rather than just undoing the brilliant dark ending of its predecessor, it delves into the failures and shortcomings of the outcome in a brilliant and very important way, that is not often seen in these kind of lighthearted adventures.

There are lots of brilliant twists and turns that are very much appreciated, and without spoiling anything, this film handles all that is set up in Infinity War gracefully.

Overall, it is a beautifully made film, some of the best effects ever seen in film and incredible cinematograpy and cutting. It features some of the best battles ever put together.

Truly a grand finale that I am glad to have seen at its premiere. Fantastic finale, and there is more, far more, to come from this wonderful franchise!",10
Best ending,26 April 2019,Cant ask for an even more satisfying ending than what the film offfered!,10
Cinematic Event - Movie History,2 May 2019,"Now I am going to put it out there that although I gave this a 10/10 it was not perfect. I enjoyed Infinity War more also. It was a great movie though, a true event and a worthy and somewhat emotional end to an epic saga. Yes, I know there will be other Marvel movies and who knows some of the old guard may return but it did kind of feel like a befitting end to many of the original characters. Thor and the Guardians were super fun, Hulk was the best he has been, Cap was truly stoic, for once I actually liked Hawkeye and Ant-Man was a laugh a minute. The plot made sense and although far fetched, who cares, most comics and superhero movies are. The action sequences were awesome also. My only gripe was that there was probably not enough action. The first couple of hours was bringing everyone together and giving us and many of the characters a chance to reminisce and feel the nostalgia. It really was at times moving and emotional especially Cap and Stark and their back stories. Then there was the final battle which was epic and moving end. Some characters cane full circle, some found happiness and some didn't and there was a set up for a few more movies and collaborations in the future. A truly great movie. I was hoping for better but at the same time was in no way disappointed. Avengers you will be missed but I have a feeling there might be more to come. The comic Avengers team have a wide and varied history and different versions of the team could keep reinventing the wheel. Will it be able to reinvent the magic, the chemistry and the love we have for this team though, I don't know. Thanks for the fun many happy memories to all involved in this franchise.",10
Worst avengers series,25 April 2019,"Less action, too many drama, and not all heroes in super hero modes, no twisted ending .. little boring.",6
End of an era,5 May 2019,"I have stayed away from the internet so that I didn't get to find out any of the storyline and spoil watching the film. This film had a tough act to follow but overall I think it did. My only criticism is that it maybe tried to be too funny at times, Infinity war was a much darker film. You can't please everyone and some of the really low ratings and bad reviews on here are ridiculous, some people need to get a grip. Overall this is a great film, full of twists, action, surprises, emotion and humour. Judge for yourselves! If this truly is the end of the road for some of the main characters I'm curious as to the focus of future Marvel films.",10
Forget Captain Marvel... meet The Rat!,3 May 2019,"After 'the vanishing' in Infinity War, there were still a handful of superheroes left knocking about to try and restore order to the universe, but in Endgame the real hero is a rat. A lowly rodent scampers across the controls of Hank Pym's quantum machine, activating a few switches with his little ratty feet, bringing Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) back from his five-year stay in the quantum realm. And it is Lang's return that kick-starts a desperate attempt to reverse Thanos' nefarious handiwork.

If you can swallow such lazy writing, then you'll no doubt have no problem with the rest of the film, which resorts to that old chestnut - time travel - with all the paradoxical problems that arise as a result. Unfortunately, I struggle to let such things slide, annoyed by rather casual approach taken by writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, whose script scampers lightly over the temporal issues like a rat over a console (I'm sorry, I just can't let that go). While the film is undeniably enjoyable as a slam bang piece of mega-budget entertainment, it isn't as flawless or as clever a denouement that one might hope for.

Visually, Endgame is hard to beat and it's great to see all of the A-list stars of the past MCU movies coming together for one last effects-filled battle (it's amazing what $400,000,000 can buy), but for the culmination of a twenty-two film series, I had dearly hoped for something a bit more considered and fulfilling than a great-looking movie that is ultimately dependent on the actions of a rat (yes, it irritated me THAT much...).",7
What a shame,1 May 2019,"Really disappointed after watching it yesterday. Unnecessarily long, very boring finish to a series of movies with a lot of peaks (Ragnarock, GotG, CaptA) and quite a few troughs (AoU, Iron Man generally, Black Panther) but I thought this was a new low. Really poor writing, idiotic plot holes and stupid action scenes. Really sad end.. felt like flogging a dead horse, shame to go out like this.",1

IT'S THE END(GAME) OF AN ERA!,26 April 2019,"This is it! This is ""THE FIGHT OF OUR LIVES!"" Of course, this was a film on my anticipation list. I didn't put it on the actual list because it was a given. I've been with this extensive universe for 10, going on 11, years. Going into the cinema, I was excited and worried, because I knew that this would be the end of an era and characters. Coming out I was exhausted in the best possible way. I, and the entire audience, were full of emotions both happy and sad. Now let's get into why. POSITIVES! After Infinity War, we were all coming back no matter what! The plot is obviously about reversing what had happened, but all of us are invested in this world, so obviously we were onboard with that. Without spoilers, the course the film takes is fantastic. Although it has a slow start, it was fantastic to slow down and deal with the impact of the Infinity War events and to see these incredible characters cope and to see how the actors performed. Everyone is great, as always. Robert Downey Jr. is fantastic. Audiences get to see an impeccable performance from the man that started it all and he is in good company. The core Avenger characters/actors are all great. Where Renner and the writers take Hawkeye is epic. Chris Evans is awesome as Cap and Johansson shines bigtime in the film. Although Josh Brolin's Thanos' appearance is limited, audiences have Infinity War to understand the character! Anthony and Joe Russo return with a punch. Taking risks in the story and action. AND THE ACTION! The final action sequence is easily my favourite action sequence among the MCU movies! The Russo Bros have an incredible ability, that they utilized in The Winter Soldier, where they showcase a character in a small role but make them large. This is what they used in Infinity War and Endgame and that made them perfect to helm to two-parter finale. The Russo Bros also had two shots that made me super emotional. The first is the final shot and it's a tear jerker from an emotional standpoint. And the other occurs as the film wraps up and it showcases how far the MCU has come. They also cameoed more of the Community cast which was hilarious! The entire film flows incredibly well and doesn't at all feel like a 3 Hour epic. This is a praise to the editors of the film, never once making the audience bored in the way they formed the narrative. The visual effects are stunning. In Infinity War I had a problem with the digital image mixed with the live action, but not here. Everything is seamless. From the digital characters to the action. It has got a lot of beautiful and familiar artwork and sets that all blend well together. The costumes are fantastic. Iron Man's and Cap's costumes were fantastic adaptations of the source material. But then again, there were other updated costumes and makeup that were welcomed upgrades. Alan Silvestri's score is used to perfection in the most epic moments! There is so much that I enjoyed and loved, but I love the fact that there are two things that occur in the third act that I have been awaiting for such a long time and the fact that they used both in the epic action sequence was the best thing to occur onscreen for such a long time! NEGATIVES! The problems I have with the film are minor and don't impact my opinion significantly. Most of these are to do with the writing. Like I said before, the film has a slow first act. Once we get past that the film picks up, but it's still there. Again, without spoiling the movie, the film deals with a certain plot device and being a huge fan of that certain device, after the movie finished, I started to deconstruct it and not a lot of it works. But that's nit-picking. The humour between characters works very well, but the humour for the audience not so much. The film takes itself seriously, and that is awesome! It's just that the humour and comedic elements are weak. Thor is awesome in the final act but before then he is used as comedic relief with how the character is displayed and portrayed, and it feels forced and unwarranted. It's unfortunate because Hemsworth was so hilarious in Thor: Ragnarok and those comedic elements flowed well into Infinity War, but not here. And lastly, this is an issue not to do with the movie but the audience. There is a lot of references and cameos to past MCU films, like a lot. And whilst this is fantastic and helps wrap up storylines and character arcs, there will be audience members that don't appreciate the references because they hadn't seen the MCU movies/franchises being referenced. Example; someone that watches The Avengers franchise but doesn't watch the Guardians of the Galaxy movies may not understand certain scenes. Not the Guardians in particular, just an example. CONCLUSION! So, Avengers: Endgame satisfies the biggest MCU fans and Marvel Comics fans with its interpretation of story and character. There are so many epic moments, along with the powerful and sad scenes that will cause a few tears due to a great script and fantastic acting. This isn't my absolute favourite MCU movie, but it's high on the list. It's the Endgame and the stories that the film wraps up are done in an appropriate and epic fashion.",

Can't think of a better way to end the story,1 May 2019,"Before walking into the theater I thought of a dozen different ways this movie could possibly play out, but it was none of those. It progresses in a make-sense but surprising fashion that I've never seen in any other movies. Not to say it doesn't have plot holes, but I happily embrace it because I honest believe no one could've done a better job in writing the story.

Epic finale!,26 April 2019,"Avengers: Endgame takes place after the grave events of Avengers: Infinity War(2018). The world is in shambles, after Thanos(Josh Brolin) succeeds with his nefarious plan. All the remaining Avengers reunite to stop Thanos, no matter what the consequences.

Avengers: Endgame is a mind-blowing film. Directors Anthony Russo & Joe Russo have given us an absolutely satisfying conclusion to the Infinity Saga, which consists of all 22 Marvel Cinematic Universe movies which have released, so far. The emotional moments make you shed a tear or two. Don't worry though. The comedic moments are aplenty, as well. The effortless chemistry & the banter among all the Avengers, remains intact. The action set pieces are glorious. The climactic set piece is the highlight of the film. You will cheer till you no longer can, as so many moments will bring you pure & unadulterated joy! The visual effects are brilliant. The 3D is eye-popping. Robert Downey Jr. is spectacular as Tony Stark/Iron Man. Chris Evans is outstanding as Steve Rogers/Captain America. Mark Ruffalo is fantastic as Bruce Banner/Hulk. Chris Hemsworth is incredible as Thor. Scarlett Johansson is unforgettable as Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow. Jeremy Renner is superb as Clint Barton/Hawkeye. Don Cheadle is effective as James Rhodes/War Machine. Paul Rudd is amazing as Scott Lang/Ant-Man. Brie Larson is awesome as Carol Danvers/Captain Marvel. Karen Gillan is awe-inspiring as Nebula. Danai Gurira is impressive as Okoye. Bradley Cooper is hysterical as Rocket. Josh Brolin is flawless as Thanos. The supporting cast is scene-stealing in their respective roles. Avengers: Endgame is a must watch. Go & experience this action-packed, hilarious, emotional & wholesomely entertaining rollercoaster ride of a film. My all-time favorite Marvel Cinematic Universe movie & the best superhero film, of all time. Absolutely jaw-dropping stuff!",10

EPIC,18 February 2021,"Avengers Endgame is the culmination of a decade of blockbuster filmmaking, existing to reward the fans love, patience, and undying adoration. Endgame has a difficolt job and did it very well. It's epic and allows space for one of the best performances from Robert Downey Jr and Chris Evan. However this movie has something less than Infinity War. The entire time I was watching Infinity War I was on the edge of my seat, afraid for every character's life, but not during all the running time of Endgame. Nevertheless Endgame has more epic moments and it is such a perfect end of the Avengers that it's hard to see serious MCU fans walking away from this disappointed.

Rating: 9,3.",9
Very disappointing.One film too many,25 April 2019,"I am going to be very unpopular her, and seem to be in the minority but this is barely an okay action film.

The advertising stated Dr Strange has seen endgame 14 million time.... believe me once is enough.

I loved infinity war, and it is by far the best MCU film. This is just a means to bring back characters. Yes it ends the saga but is lacking.

The humour is clumsy and although a few laugh out loud moments, overall these seemed forced.

It had so much potential and although filmed simultaneously with infinity war, feels like a totally separate film. It's akin to one person writing one and then someone else picking up the second, disagreeing with that story line and just making there own version by undermining what the first and the other 21 movies had achieved.",6
Film made by fans and made for fans,4 August 2019,Truly epic and incredible experience worth every penny,9
Just decent enough,25 April 2019,"Infinity War is just too big of a movie to overcome & Endgame suffers from trying to do it. The pacing was bad. Some characters are misrepresented & their arcs are ruined by doing so. Somehow this movie can't handle the amount of characters in it, but it's predecessor do it really great. Disappointing.",7
This is all we get as the capstone of Marvel's phase whatever?,13 May 2019,"Terribly disappointed in the effort. There should have been something ""more"". The movie plods from scene to scene with no real tension, almost as if marvel is giving the viewer the cliff notes on the last 10 years of films. Even the end battle was snooze-worthy, including the mostly useless Captain Marvel showing up as the deus ex machina.",2
Marvel Studios' Magnum Opus,26 April 2019,"A marvellously epic & enormously satisfying extravaganza that concludes a decade's worth of narrative on a thumping & triumphant note, Avengers: Endgame is a crescendo, a celebration, a closure & a culmination of a 22-film saga that returns our 11 years of investment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe with a massive pay-off. A memorable finale of an unprecedented cinematic universe that won't soon, if ever, find an equal, Endgame is Marvel Studios' magnum opus.",
Worth The 21-Movie Pre-Film Marathon,17 August 2019,"I think film is entering a post-cliche phase, where tired tropes are no longer tired, but are now just accepted tools in a storyteller's toolbox. Certainly we don't need to enforce originality on all forms of art. I adore this film. The entire MCU is a breathtaking opera, and this is the ten-year grand finale. You *do* need to see all twenty-one previous films (in chronological order, hopefully, rather than release order) because taken on its own, ""Endgame"" would be a mishmash, with so many of its call-backs missed.

I think film is also leaving the era of the auteur, and entering that of the committee. George Lucas may have been the final straw, as when Disney (the originators of the committee method, from what I can tell) picked up the mantle of that particular franchise, their natural choice to revert to committee decisions dovetailed with everyone's need to get franchises out of one person's control. The MCU was planned out ten years in advance, so that almost at once -- and certainly by Ultron -- ""Endgame"" was being envisioned. Seeing how all the disparate threads meet and find either their resolution or their own inspiring arc, that *in itself* is amazing. Knowing that, in the most crucial moment of the film, we get a familiar call-back to a much earlier part of the MCU, elevates the experience from one of possible bewilderment to outright joy. It's no wonder that other directors would defer this type of blockbuster to the Russos. I only wonder how anyone involved in the creative process could have kept these secrets to themselves for ten years. Knowing that this film makes its predecessor seem like a prelude, and all the other significant milestones in the franchise series seem like blips on a radar, it must have been nerve-wracking to know how all of this turns out and still feed us those ""massive"" revelations in the earlier films.

When in the right context, a superlative experience. As good a film experience as you will find. Yes, if you don't gel with the film, it could strike you any number of odd ways, but most people are on board with it being a new classic.",10

Excellent Ending & Conclusion.,27 April 2019,"For a series in the Marvel universe that started fairly bland, MCU's Avengers: Endgame brings out everything that makes it stand out. Characters were solid, all respected their role in the plot and not one of the dialogues between them was redundant. Plot kept its pacing, coherence and more importantly its continuation from Infinity War which is essentially Part 1 of this movie. This is one the weird movies that doesnt soely rely on its own 1hr 30 mins narrative to drive a plot, but takes privileges from the movies that came before and neatly tie everything down, its clever and well executed, i honestly wish there were more moments like this in the MCU. No spoilers so its short, this is a movie that deserve praise, 10/10 for perfect sequel.",10
Not that good,28 April 2019,"Its a Bit underwhelming for this last thing.But you can watch it without out dying, although ist pretty sad.",6
Perfect Infinity Saga Ending,11 October 2021,"Avengers: Endgame is an incredible, riveting, highly entertaining and very emotional film, and a brilliant end to the Marvel's Infinity Saga. My first time viewing left me speechless and pleasantly surprised, and I had high expectations. Just like Infinity War before it, it is a masterful film that managed to meet the massive expectations of fans, delivering perfectly on story and character development in a ways I couldn't even expect.

While some may think it has a slow beginning, you've come to care so much about the characters and story that it's still investing. The story is intriguing and filled with countless twists and turns that keep you hooked. Seeing each of the characters continue and close their story arcs is very satisfying and poignant, especially how they concluded the stories of Tony Stark and Steve Rogers; you could not ask for a better ending for these characters then what this movie delivers. While some seemed to have a problem with Smart Hulk, I really quite liked him and it was a satisfying conclusion to the conflict between Banner and Hulk. And what they did with Thor is a testament to how much the Russos cared more about characters then eye candy or fanservice; it is completely understandable, realistic, and human to see him devastated after everything terrible that has happened to him, crushed by his own failure, and its great when he begins to believe in himself again. The film balances its emotional scenes perfectly with its comic relief as to make a film that feels appropriately heartfelt and somber while also not forgetting to let its audience have a little fun. The huge final battle is an absolute feast for the eyes and never fails to get me giddy. It has to be one of the most astounding battles ever on film. There exist no lapses in the visual effects, the music is perfect, and acting is excellent, the entire cast gives top-tier performances.

An excellent film and a perfect follow-up to Infinity War and ending to the Infinity Saga.",10

If you are a Marvel fan - I promise I will keep the #Don'tSpoilTheEndGame. This is an emotional rollercoster - you will laugh (we cried of laughter at a few scenes), you will cry (so take tissues), you will hold your breathe, you will be on the edge of your seat and you will pump your fists. 3 hours fly and you will sit through the end credits trying to work out how you feel - emotionally drained but satisfied too I hope. Having watched all other movies in chronological order this month I am amazed at how this pulls all of the unknown as well as known loose strings together. If you are new to Marvel world then you must watch Avengers:Infinity Wars first or this will not make sense.",10
The pinnacle of Marvel's years of story building,24 April 2019,"This is definitely the pinnacle of Marvel's years of story building, so epic, so mesmerizing, so perfect. I couldn't imagine any superhero movie could be any greater than this, at least not in the foreseeable future. I don't think anybody should miss this movie. Watch it while it's still playing on theatres. This could be the greatest movie of this decade, or even any decade for that matter.",10
Cinematic masterpiece!!!,29 April 2019,I'm no reviewer of films but just my two cents! That was amazing! It was the perfect way to end a 22 film cycle that will never be done again and that is why it gets a 10 from me.,10
A Satisfying Conclusion to the Infinity Saga (Spoiler-Free),24 April 2019,"Avengers: Endgame was made by the cast and crew of Infinity War and is the last film of Phase 3 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

Endgame, as the last film, offers an utterly unpredictable, ambitious and unique story that pleasurably ends the saga. The feeling of catharsis is present throughout the film. Each character has a character arc with some that isn't present in the preceding films.

The visuals of the film improved from Infinity War. Some scenes offered CGI heavy scenes that almost felt like a comic book. More ""comic-bookey"" from the previous films.

The tone of the film is probably the darkest of the whole MCU but still has a lot of humor sprinkled throughout, which all of them worked. The performances of the cast were the best they've ever been, giving their characters more layers than it's ever been.

Endgame is a very cathartic film for old and new fans alike. With some devastating moments, it is a very emotionally satisfying film that every Marvel and movie fans need to see. The eleven years of build up and characterization has paid off in this very historic comic book movie. It is by far, the best MCU and the best comic movie we have.

-Yman Dayawon",10
"Take a Bow, Avengers & Russo Brothers!",24 April 2019,They couldn't give every hero equal billing (they tried with Antman & Captain Marvel which is the minus one star) so they made the movie all about the original Avengers from 2012 and...the movie does not disappoint. Couple of 'wow' moments with a generous sprinkling of sweet tender moments throughout. The best finale anyone can ask for and a fitting curtain call for the original Avengers. Kudos and a big THANK YOU to the Russo brothers!,9
"WAY OVERHYPED, insult to intelligent fans IMO.",27 April 2019,"Epic opening scene follow by 90 mins of nothing special followed by 80 mins of waves of poor quality to solid quality with a epic final battle scene. So many parts that made zero sense. The more time that goes on the less sense some of the story line makes. I could go on for hours about stuff that was negative and about 15 mins of quality to be spoken of. Look, everyone will watch for themselves. Ultimately disappointing unless your a stubborn baised superfan who believes marvel can do no wrong.",6

Emotional Cinematic Experience,24 April 2019,"For me, Avengers: Endgame is honestly the greatest, most thrilling and epic film of the MCU, the battle scenes and performances shown were never done before in Marvel cinematic history and they will leave you with so much surprises!

11 years in the making and it DID NOT DISAPPOINT. It exceeded everyone's expectations and even the comic book nerd ones!

Go see it while you can because you will NEVER ever experience something like this in a movie theatre this breath-taking and shocking.

It also had such an amazing and satisfying wrap-ups to the major characters of the MCU. Couldn't ask for a better movie and a better way to end this hell-of-a journey.",10

If you nit-pick any film you'll find holes on top of holes. Continuity errors. Things that happen without reason. This movie has so many super heroes in it, the amount of logic errors are mountainous and also, who cares? We don't watch these movies to pick them apart. We watch them to escape our universe and temporarily enter theirs. This movie could have been better in many ways but it was damn near perfect with all its flaws. Reminds me of humans...",9

The genre of this movie is Comedy,29 April 2019,"Of course, Comedy with Fantasy and Action. The heroes are like your uncles and aunts, fun to watch but not what pumps your senses for the thrill. You'll feel all the time like it's meh, because they want to make all audiences enjoy the movie. Doing that the movie becomes average. So the characters are all good hearted and full of feelings, nothing like a hero who has True Will. I'm glad that at least this last movie didn't come with ideological references, it was just this polictical correctness that numbs us as society. Everyone is a good boy there. Anyway, the public that Marvel seeks now is not me. No problem, since I noticed it, I'll just ignore future movies from them. Leave a thumbs up if now you also agree it's a comedy movie not an action thriller movie, so other people can see this too.",7
The best movie produced by the studio,24 April 2019,"The previous Avenger movies do not have a perfect plot because of it's limited time for a long story. The endgame is long enough to enjoy the rising action and twists and everything else just for the final hit, way better than all previous movies. The reason I gave 9 stars instead of 10 is because the storyline consists of fragments which were presented not perfectly but it's good. I mean it is hard to make it perfect but your mind have to be flexible and clear enough to switch between those fragments. Overall it's worth watching it.",9
I don´t get it ?,19 December 2019,"Maybe because I´m an ""over 50 year old European"" (when I look at the votes) but I don´t get it. A cast filled with big names of which have very good resumes. But this movie gives me the idea: Let´s push 1 more out ""for the team"". A team that seems to be growing with extra superheroes with every sequel.

Not a movie I would watch alone, nor with my children who are 27 and 29 years of age. Maybe in 10 years time with my grandchildren but than it´s prolly outdated, like I might be atm. But these cash cow movies don´t do it for me anymore.",6

It is a hard 11,31 July 2019,"Let's start with this, the plot has little flaws or plot holes here and there. And if you didn't watch a whole lot of other previous MCU films. Maybe this is not for you.

For me, who watched every MCU movies ever produced. This one has it all. A new take on hero movie, part of it like mission impossible. Very well thought out story. A hidden layer of means. Take its time to resolve many things, not rushing it.

action-packed and effects galore,19 June 2019,"Watching the coming attractions was depressing. No wonder kids are half brain-dead today. My only interest in anything Avengers is Benedict Cumberbatch. I thought this was a fun film, loved all the cameos and the actors are all very likable. Special effects were amazing, but for about a half hour there I felt like I was watching a video game.

Thought the script managed to have some poignancy and humor as well. And you have to see it in a theater.",8
Hot Damn!,2 August 2019,"Where to begin? All the callbacks and tie-ins to past MCU films are truly a celebration of the MCU. As always, the action is exciting(Although sparse) and humour cracks you up. This movie reaches a new level going into the third act, with epic moments that put a grin on your face and an ending that might just put a tear in your eye. A must watch!",10
Must see for mcu and comic books fans/superhero cinema enthusiasts,30 July 2019,"It's funny it's a great movie with great reviews and is highly successful, overall. But, the trolls are coming out to play on imdb today, boy. It tied up previous loose ends from past films, it had a good story that was inventive, fun and clever. It had many easter eggs tied to past films and movies and is a great superhero film and a good film, period.

9.4/10",10
Awesome movie ever but little slow than other Avenger,25 April 2019,Ending of the Avenger with awesomeness but I feel little slow than other Avenger because of too emotional scenes.,10
Overrated and boring. But nice ending though.,17 May 2019,"I guess the headline wraps it up - what I feel about the movie, that is. With three hours and a rather good prequel it was expected to see some epic action and showdown between the good and evil characters, but yet we only get some minor action scenes and a heck of a lot of boring dialogues and stuff like that. Where is Superman when you need him? At least that would have made the movie more exciting for me. No, the movie has some moments, but it takes too long to get there, and when we do we only get a tiny bit of the action I was hoping for. Thus, with a rating of 8.8 and a throng og positive reviews I must say the movie was disappointingly bad, though not as bad as I first thought it would be after the first two hours though. If you like long dialogues and conversations between superheroes and fancy waiting for action through an entire movie then surely this is for you. If you're like me and liked Thor 3 best since it had a lot of action, then this will be better to watch on Netflix or something when you're out of options.",6
End of an era masterpiece,28 April 2019,"In arguably the most anticipated movie of the year and one of the most anticipated movies of all time, Avengers: Endgame was well on its way with all the hype leading up to the film. Having enjoyed Infinity War but thought it could have been better all around, the overall hype for Endgame had its match made. Now having watching this film in theaters as it was a must watch to (due to the 3D experience and also knowing the longer one waited, the more likely spoilers would have been exposed, ruining the experience and essence of the film).

As a film, won't say much but this film delivers on expectations. Had no knowledge of the overall plot but within the first few minutes, one was excited and was there for the thrill of the ride throughout. With a runtime of over three hours (including end credits), the film has a great pace and doesn't feel nearly as long (which is great since something is always happening). Due to its great cast and plethora of characters, there really is never a dull moments and the film is ensured and filled with moments of surprise, suspense, action emotion and overall greatness.

Now the overall plot of time travel was well done and brought back many memories to the other Avenger films. The wait for the film was most definitely worth it, and this film will most doubly become one of the biggest movies of alltime. Will need to see this film probably once more in theaters before its run is over and most definitely will see it again multiple times afterwards to soak in its greatness. Avengers: Endgame is more than a movie, it's a moment - a moment in time. Cherish every moment.",10
Not a good ending,17 August 2019,"Terrible ending, I can say terrible, it was scaled down to a funny story rather than a great one, worst avengers movie ever",6
Just another overhyped MCU tribute to Fans.,30 April 2019,This is a good movie in terms of all its technical background but there is a lack of feel and energy throughout the film except for the scenes towards the end. You just needs to sit and wait patiently for the final battle. If you are a Marvel fan then you will enjoy it like any other Marvel films otherwise it can get sort of boring surely an overrated film.,1
Absolutely perfect,3 June 2019,We can't say anything to this awesome work these russo brothers did the work very perfect,10
Crushes it,13 May 2019,"AE is the Final battle of Infinity Saga which concluded the story of every movie since 2008. The time travel explanation was good.It felt like Inception. The ending was the most fulfilling for Iron Man and Captain America. This movie couldn't have been better. The only problem with this movie was with the dubbed version in Hindi, they made the crap out of it, it was the worst dubbing ever. Please Marvel India take this into consideration.

Incredible in scope but not flawless,25 April 2019,"The hype surrounding this film after Infinity War was unavoidable. This is the finale to a very long lead up of films and that final action scene is money well spent. Endgame doesn't have that flawless conclusion but at least it's ambitious. It is exactly how a massive ensemble cast should be filmed and it never feels one sided, it's an Avengers film. My issue with the film is more about the repeating villain and large plot holes left from the time travel. It lacks answers and leaves the clean-up to Spiderman Far From Home. I miss the times when films had to be complete and explained. Infinity War was a better film and offered more.",7

"35% awesome, 65% tedious",27 April 2019,"Avengers: Endgame. Overall it was... ok. The intro got off to a quicker start than I imagined, and the expected final battle was certainly fun followed by a touching denouement. Those elements (barely) justify the film, in my opinion.

However, the intervening 2 hours is a tedious collection of scenes, lame jokes and awful characterizations wrapped around an extremely tired and poorly thought out plot device. Should you see it? Sure. How can you not after investing so many years in the arc? But most people I saw it with were ultimately (at least somewhat) disappointed.

Worst performance in the movie is easily Mark Ruffalo who has now solidified his legacy as the absolute worst Hulk and Banner ever committed to film. Thor was also terrible, but that's been a rapid devolution since Ragnarok.

Surprisingly, the movie was pretty much stolen by the stellar performance of Jeremy Renner, which should build interest in the upcoming Hawkeye series (even if it is just a vehicle to hand off the mantle). Scarlett Johansson also stepped up her game and was very impressive.",6
Excellent movie,21 May 2020,"The end is beautiful, is excellent movie marvel. The movie avengers end game is hype 💯",10
"Wisely written, beautifully captured and originally told conclusion of a long story",29 April 2019,"Just after watching the movie I wanted to write a bad review comparing this with another creatures of cinematography from different genres which I personaly prefer more, but then I thought - why should I be so biased to a certain category of movies, revised everything and understood that this picture is oustandingly well. First, it logically continues where we left in the previous part, from which that movie is significantly different - overall mood seems to shift from seriousness and in some degree of sadness to more bright and hilarious composition. Plot is not completely straightforward and persuades a viewer to continue watching. The really bad thing is that there were some moments which in case of applying a deep inspecting seems to be silly, but, one the other hand, it could be understood as providing a simplificated view on the story, something balancing between nice-captured one without a plot and one having a plot but without any beautiful scenes. Surely, there are lots of computer graphics, but, though, there are too many realistic battle scenes as for me, and even as I can't say that image lacks beautiful scenes, I would increase quantity of colorful episodes. As a result - the movie worth watching definetely, but make sure that you watched at least the previous movie - then you'll get much bigger outcome since these two strongly connected in the logical sense and tell a single story.",7
Totally overrated!! Terrible film with several plot holes,13 May 2019,"Terrible movie. I have never been a big fan, of Marvel and even less of MCU, but there were several good movies within that universe.... but this one as the Infinity Gauntlet, destroyed all.... No sense to talk about, the respect of the comic source.... but Stan Lee, Jack Kirby, Steve Ditko, and many others involved on their comic origin of the characters has to be suffering in hell seeing how their creations were terribly undermined....... but just analizing from a cinematographic point of view, this film has a terrible argument, script, direction and very poor characters.... 2 hours of the film were not needed, and all the structure that were builded for this collapsed with this ending. Plot holes and nonsense everywhere.

This film represents what social media can do.... in a bad way. Stay away, if you can.",1
It's the end,4 May 2019,"Avengers: Endgame is the epicenter of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. This movie encapsulates everything that we have been waiting for since Iron Man. Because it is in fact a Marvel movie, the base level of quality is of course high. This includes acting, score, visual effects, cinematography, etc. Endgame is comparable to Infinity War except it does more. This movie shows our favorite Avengers at not only their lowest, but also at their highest both emotionally and physically. Hawkeye grows as a character, Rocket grows, Banner grows, Thor GROWS. Captain America gets an incredible amount of growth as a character as well but nowhere near as much as Tony Stark. The movie takes the characters we love so much and gives us a glimpse into what it feels to lose like they did. The plot is witty and engaging all the way through and the shifts in tone make sense and transition smoothly. My two gripes with this film which is very close to a 5/5 are the main antagonist that is fought at the very end of the film and the inclusion of Captain Marvel. In my opinion she is the only piece of this movie that seems out of place. If I were to describe this movie in only one word, that word would be epic.",9

"Part soap opera, part superhero. Not bad but it could have been shorter.",26 April 2019,"A lot of people clearly liked the Avengers: Endgame. I heard Chris Evans cried in some places when he watched the finished movie. I could see what he meant but I didn't cry. In fact there was so much going on that I felt I needed a scorecard. Who was on screen, what was their motivation and what happened 2, 3 or 4 movies ago. I have seen all the movies but clearly not as up on it as some I met, who apparently had seen some of the movies several times.

Overall not bad but here are a few moans -

The infinity stones always seemed a MacGuffin to me. They appeared from nowhere and had strange powers, often not explained much or used much either.

I heard but don't really get Thanos's motivation. He seems to have some hand wavy reason for wanting to reduce the universe's population. Paradoxically, even though, he's the villain it plays into the rather PC idea that there are too many people. People are a blessing, not a curse.

Captain Marvel was played up a bit. She's the only one who can save the universe? Apparently she's been busy elsewhere until now.

Now in conclusion, not bad but not good. OK movie but could have been shorter for my liking.

For comparison, I had a brief look at what I'd watched in a cinema from the last 12 months and the ones that stood out include First Man, Shazam, Glass, Jurassic Wrold: Fallen Kingdom, Deadpool 2, The Happy Prince, Christopher Robin, Green Book, White Crow, Dumbo, Wild Rose. I find most of them better than Endgame.",7
Unique and Well Thought Out,27 April 2019,"Avengers Endgame, as insanely hyped as it was, had 3 hours to show an incredible wrap to 10 years of the MCU. It was unique and all the people saying many aspects of the movie were ""predictable"" are not necessarily correct. Endgame brought surprises other Marvel movies couldn't have done at it's supreme extent. Personally, I caught myself finding the movie less predictable than predictable towards its core plot. This movie is a must see, and you will find yourself captivated all the way through.

It movies gives you exactly what you want as a fan of the franchise and more. I do believe the movie would be difficult to follow if you aren't an avid watcher of the franchise, however it is abundantly clear that those are the kind of people this movie was made for. It gives you some great character moments (the best of the entire MCU), amazing action sequences, some fan service moments, and even the feels. This is one of those films that I feel everyone should go and see for sure. Watch a few of the previous Marvel films to get an understanding of the franchise and then go see Avengers: Endgame and be apart of history.",10

Also was not such a fan of how they changed certain main characters appearance - for the worse in my opinion.,6

It's funny, it's sad, it's awesome with scenes that will make you want to throw your fists in the air. The entire cast gives their greatest performance yet. I was very angry when Star-Lord fudged everything in the last movie but if it wasn't for him, we wouldn't have this masterpiece.

Thank you Marvel.",10

Okayish-,27 July 2021,After infinity war I really had very high hopes from this. Bit disappointed-,7
an elephant gave birth to a mouse..,5 May 2019,"I am sort of sorry that the rares time I write a review, it is not a kind one. But I am sorrier still that the rares times I watch theater movies, it is because of high ratings of previous reviewers.

Yep, that is how i chose this one.

""Astonishing"", ""perfect"", ""masterpiece"", ""9 out of 10"" were some of the comments and ratings around, so I thought, this must be it, if I have to see one movie this year, it's this one.

But honestly :

Special effects, are good.

Plot is so plain you understand what is going to happen and how it is going to end in the first ten minutes. And there are no twists whatsoever. Everything is pretty much recycled from other movies - not talking about ""avengers"" or marvel series; rather, just any SF movies out there were used as ideas sources to fill this one. Nothing new, nothing different.

Yeah, there are a few nice jokes, and some fat, both so badly plugged you can see the stitching (you'll understand when you see it). In the past, when heroes were making jokes during a battle, it was to show they mastered the situation, and it was fitting the atmosphere and pace; in this one, you can see at some point the director absolutely wanted to put a joke in the middle of the main battle - broke the rythm and half spoiled the mood just because of that.

Movie is three hours long.

I just watched two episodes of an old anime series from the 80's, and in those 46 minutes, there was pretty much as much action and stuff going on than in these almost-three-hours of medium paced show. So although people say it was needed to fit all the references to previous marvel movies, i'd rather have less references and more things happening in this one.

As it often happens in these follow-ups, previous movies created such an intricate situation that this one solved in such a straight-forward way, it felt as if somebody wanted it rushed to the finish.

And in order to do that, it took the party of a lousy quantum physics theory (which is actually wrong, btw), and left some important side question unanswered

And not to talk about the mania from the producers to destroy stuff that went on for décades, or millennia, all in the timespan of a few years! We had ragnarok, the death of Odin.. And now.. this? Well without spoiling the movie for those that want to see it, I'd say it looked like they wanted to make sure that this put an end to the story. Even if that meant to break the logic of these movies : ""Thus far and no further we shall make avengers movies"" God complex, perhaps?

All in all, it wasn't any better than an old Flash Gordon movie, except for the SFX that are of course more modern. I'm giving it a 3 out of 10, as 1 and 2 are reserved for movies that don't deserve watching till the end. But I believe that once the paid comments and the avengers mania will be past, many other will downrate this, that definitely did not deserve all that advertising and praise it received so far.

Definitely a cash movie, nothing more.",3
AMAZING,26 April 2019,Just AMAZING AMAZING AMAZINGLY TALENTED GUYS WHO ARE THE ONLY REASON FOR THIS ONE I THINK I WILL BE GOING BACK,10
Entertainment for real.,6 May 2019,"Oh my, these guys have done beautifully. I've never been so happy after a superhero movie, like ever. If you thought Infinitty War was awesome, wait until Endgame takes you to infinitty and beyond. Direction is flalwless, there is no part where you feel like ""waiting"". The screenplay has done a very nice job solving many question, although is not perfect. In any way you want to see it, The Avengers Endgame does not dissapoint, and it will be recalled as the best finale ever made for a saga, for many years to come",10
Excellent,6 July 2023,,10
How far would you go in order to surprise your audience,29 April 2019,"Once again I debated with myself, whether I should write a review here. I know most of you won't like what I want to say. I also know with over 4500 reviews already here, most of those who may agree with me, won't even get to see it. It will simply get lost in the sea of fake reviews (paid or otherwise) flooding most of internet sites dedicated to such things. But eventually I decided that keeping what I want to say, in my belly will hurt more. So - here goes:

It's a great film based on a few false premises, some of which I already discussed here more than once. See on my review page what I've written about Infinity War, or Captain Marvel. In my personal book, every time a comics superhero dies, somebody made a mistake he (or she), didn't know how to fix. The control directors and script writers have over this sort of material is un limited. So if people don't like the character, and I mean real people not review writers that have a personal grudge against superheroines, because the actress is Israeli or because she was made too strong. If real people don't like the character, you wrote it wrong. Let's agree, it didn't happen here. People love the MCU characters, they were all beautifully written, and each actor performing them did wonders. They became as real as fictional characters can. So I knew what happened in this movie had to happen. I even wrote so in my review for infinity war. I must admit, I didn't guess the way they'll go about it, but I knew the many franchises, stemming from the MCU couldn't end. It wasn't a secrete, they kept on working on some sequells while working on this movie. And still, they did surprise me (and everybody else too). But, this sort of a surprise, dosn't cut it for me. Let's carry on with the toy box imagery, that the Russo brothers spoke about in their own IMDb interview. Think about going to play with your friend, he/she shows you a boxful of amazing toys, ""I love them to pieces"" they say, and the very next thing they take out a hummer and break some of them to smithereens. Surprise you? didn't I"" yes, you sure did, but you're an idiot. And the fact, the entire movie prooves you're not, is making it even worse.

There's no reason in the world to drive the franchise this way, apart from the ego of the people having all the toys, their stupid wish to surprise us and to proove they really can do whatever they want.

I may have high esteem for their abilities. I have to agree, it was a great movie - I really didn't like it. And all the reasons for the ending we got, that I can think of, are making it even worse.",8

3000 stars!,27 April 2019,11 years!! 22 Movies!! And Such a beautiful ending This is the finest work from Marvel Cinematic Universe.Every character played their part perfectly! Great Story! Great Direction! MCU LOVE YOU 3000,10
Endgame finalises eleven years of meticulous planning in an epic superhero extravaganza.,25 April 2019,"The Marvel Cinematic Universe is a behemoth. A cultural phenomenon that has enveloped the minds of audiences everywhere. Since 2008 when 'Iron Man' graced our screens in a small yet metal-bashing blockbuster, we knew something big was happening. Deep down. And now, eleven years later, this fantastical journey of spectacular conflicts and personable characters has come to an almighty conclusion. Generations have been anticipating, for a whole arduous year, how the remaining Avengers were going to stop Thanos post-snap.

The burning question raised from this extravagant superhero soap opera: Does Endgame sufficiently conclude the franchise? It's an inescapable thought. Endgame was no longer just a film in an elongated series of interconnected stories. It was answers. We needed them, and we needed them executed satisfactorily.

So, does it? Yes. A resounding yes. My inner fanboy was pleased with the sheer amount of fan service shoved into this epic three hour beast. The third act especially, which we all know is the climactic battle (I believe I'm safe to say that...), is teeming with mesmerising energy as the Russo brothers shove as much glorified content as they possibly can. However, do not mistake my inner child-like demeanour as a critical analysis of the film, for am I not blindsided. It's very easy to succumb to the colossal amount of fan service and forget about the criticisms. I would not do that to you.

Treating this film as I would any other, I found myself embroiled with many reservations. This is not a perfect film. It is flawed with contrived plot conveniences and a narrative structure that segregates its tones far too excessively, consequently producing inconsistent pacing. Problem is, I am unable to discuss these issues with you. In fact, it's one of those rare films to which I can't really say anything at all, for it may be deemed a spoiler (and I'm not falling down that Asgardian pitfall again...)! Let's try though.

The first act explored the humanistic drama beneath these heroes. Conflicting emotions as they adjust to the immediate vacuous lives after the events of 'Infinity War'. An interesting direction from the Russo brothers took which injected a dark melancholic aura, cementing the finality of this franchise. Then, the second act kicks in once a particular character is re-introduced. Let's just say I wasn't overly enamoured with the film during the second hour. Intrinsically implementing a barrage of references from previous entries, to the point that it becomes overstuffed and a detriment to the overall arc of the plot. The beautiful development of Thanos from its predecessor seemingly shattered in this instalment, resulting in a simplistic antagonist. And the exaggerated comedy came across as desperate, especially from Thor. Whilst appealing to general audiences and acting as a crowd pleaser, it unfortunately didn't gel with me. I blame 'Ragnarok'.

Thankfully the third act saves the day, with what I can only describe as a sublime celebration of the cinematic universe. That is what Endgame is all about. Celebration. From the heart wrenching moments (yes, please bring a tissue or twenty) to the chaotic action, the Russo brothers celebrate eleven years of work into three hours. The last hour was entertainment done perfectly, and left me with moist eyes and a smile across my face. Performances were top notch from all cast members, especially Downey Jr., and I had minimal qualms with the visual effects. A few action scenes were edited haphazardly, but just a small nitpick in the technical department.

So, let me change the initial question. Is Endgame the perfect superhero blockbuster? No. I would go as far as saying I believe 'Infinity War' was better executed and remains the best 'Avengers' film (not to be mistaken with best MCU film). Yet, regardless of my insignificant disappointment for the film itself, Endgame had enormous pressure. It could've simply buckled under the weight. But it didn't. For that, I applaud Marvel Studios and everyone involved. You don't need me to tell you to go and see it, just do it.",6
Epic,24 April 2019,"Epic conclusion, really enjoy all the mcu movie... Definitely must see Amazing ,emotional movie

Love it",10
This movie was definitely shot by Russo?,3 May 2019,"This is a very weak film that has both good sides and bad sides, a good side is only in the picture and in the humor, everything else is bad, the plot is weak and we repeat ourselves, there are many plot holes, the laws of the universe are violated, sometimes the graphics look very cheap, if the war of infinity is a masterpiece then the endgame is a fan service !!! So bad final(((",6
Boring,2 May 2019,I expected an action movie with a real battle. Unfortunately it was just a loong and boring exchange of lines..,4
Realistic,24 January 2020,For people who are saying something is not realistic we are talking about a marvel movie with superheroes who fly have superhuman powers and survive things that are insane. I do not understand why anyone would compare this movie to anything. The CGI is masterpiece. This was meant to be fun and imaginative. Marvel series never tried to be realistic.,10
A good fricking movie for a good ending.,25 April 2019,,10
And the Oscar goes to........,29 April 2019,I've never seen a movie like that in my life it was perfect in every way and when we talk about Oscar winning movies this better be on the ballot next year as well as the Russo brothers and Robert Downey jr. Heck the whole cast absolutely classic forget Gone With the Wind this is the greatest movie ever made.,10
The greatest film of all time,8 August 2022,"There is truly no experience or film like Avengers Endgame. It was 10+ years in the making with payoffs that finally came to fruition. Never have I sat in a movie theater so electrifying.

I cried, I cheered, I laughed and I gasped in awe moment after moment. Endgame will forever be the height of any theatrical release. The plot keeps you engaged from the second it starts to the bittersweet ending. I've seen it about 12 times now and it'll never get old. Marvel is at the top of the game and is not slowing down.",10

The Best of Marvel Studios,30 September 2019,"The best superhero movie of all time. Excellent film, the best movie of 2019, in my opinion.",8
"Not bad, but okay.",26 April 2019,"I'm honestly surprised at the amount of highly rated reviews, this feels like the standard superhero movie with a few little twists. The characters are standard and fine, with the exception of Captain Marvel, who is so perfect that she only fails when the plot tells her to and she has no stake or motivation in the story. The plot is slow, obvious, and kind-of bad honestly, but the action is good, especially the final action scene. It's a fine movie, I like it more than Avengers 2, Thor 1-2, etc. But it's not life changing in any way. Bonus points to Hawkeye for actually being a somewhat good character. 6.5/10",6
Simply astonishing,24 April 2019,"When Infinity War ended last year I said to myself that there was no way the next Avengers film could ever surpass its greatness. Well, simply put I was wrong. Endgame brought the goosebumps caused by the rollercoaster of overwhelming emotions that enveloped the entire audience. Or maybe just me for I was clapping and cheering while the whole cinema remained reserved in its reactions. But anyways the film through its 3 hour runtime brought anticipation, excitement, and a rush of adrenaline through my veins. Every scene has this certain feel that makes you think that you're in the same mess as the main characters are. That aspect gave each scene a certain tension, that of which other films lack. A constant feel of danger so to speak but that also gives you the opportunity to laugh and... well like I said its a plethora of emotions really. I don't want to get in detail about everything in the film but wow, this is history and we get to tell our grandkids how it was to see it firsthand. Simply astonishing 10/10 I am at lost for words really.",10
Really disappointing,27 April 2019,,7
Infinity War >> Endgame,8 May 2019,"I don't want to spoil it for anyone, but from my point of view Infinity War is way better than Endgame. I do feel like Endgame tried to copy some great scenes from Infinity War, yet those ones were miserably executed. The only thing amazing about Endgame is Captain Marvel and her new short haircut, but that's about all that shines on Endgame :(. I am really disappointed, I really hoped for something better and not that predictable. Unfortunately Endgame lies in a category of movies for which even the trailer is better than the movie..",4

Exactly what you're hoping for.,27 April 2019,"Normally there are a lot of plot holes in these kind of movies (the ones HISHE delve into and make you mad later) but other than one, I honestly can't think of any.

Epic ending to an outstanding series,24 April 2019,"For 11 years marvel has been building up for their epic finale and it is almost safe to say they nailed it With an emotional roller-coaster, breathtaking soundtracks and epic scenes and fight sequences that will be the standard against which all the upcoming movies of this genre is held, Marvel delivered the superhero movie of the decade However, the plot felt a little forced as they were constantly trying to provide the perfect finale - which they almost did -, they filled the movie with plot drivers to reach the epic peak of Marvel cinematic universe But all in all I can safely say that it's one of the best movies I've ever seen and it can probably withstand the test of time as people at different times can sit at the edges of their seats as they see the ""AVENGERS ASSEMBLE"".",7

This movie is everything a marvel/MCU fan could want, emotional, yet satisfying, and the humour is just so good, sometimes one may even forget the sad parts. $1.2 billion made in the world wide box office in just 3 days of the movie's global release! biggest box office first day collection yet! Avengers: Endgame is truly one big and memorable ending to the first 11 years of the MCU and the 22 movies before it. It is certainly something that MCU fans have always wanted, but never expected. I laughed, I cheered, but in the end, I couldn't stop crying. People in the cinema were cheering and laughing louder than I have ever heard anyone cheer for any movie yet, although there were moments when the whole audience went silent. Not even 1 week since it's release and Avengers: Endgame has already broken so many world records! From the visuals and CGI/VFX to the way that the story is handled and shown, A TRULY PERFECT MOVIE IN EVERY WAY.",10

Finally watched it.,5 March 2023,"I recently bought both this, and part one The Avengers: Infinity War, used on ebay (as I have boycotted Disney). I must say, I was disappointed (in both), although each has made billions. Most of the Avengers were whiny, pathetic renditions of their former selves. Ant Man was the exception. Regarding the Disney inserts of playful Marvel banter? Many felt VERY forced, to the point where it was borderline uncomfortable to watch. I needed to see it to finish out the MCU. I 'might' watch Guardians 3. Might. Used. I'm not interested in further feeding The Rat that IS modern Disney. So sad, as I grew up in the 60s/70s when Disney was great.",7

This was a disasater of a movie,1 May 2019,"Avengers Endgame - what a disappointment. Too long, too boring and too sappy. What was I watching - soap opera? Low on action, full on drama, corny dialogues about friendship and family. The hall was supposed to be houseful according to bookmyshow and PVR, bullshit, it had less than 1/4 seats full. Something very fishy is going on. Totally anti climactic after Infinity Wars and Thor Ragnarok. The direction Marvel has chosen after Captain Marvel and Now this. Seems like films are statistically driven now, with an eye on how to make the film click - by hook or crook. Captain Marvel - Woman driven, here too there is one scene clearly pushing that agenda. In the last battle there is a shot where all the woman get together for the final fight - just by chance. The entire focus for this move was, high on emotions, must have done some calculations for that is what the box office collection tell.

If I had got an honest review I would have given this movie a skip, you should too.",4

If you're a casual watcher you might not get why everyone loves this movie so much, which is unfortunate because you should really watch every movie in order before this to appreciate the entire story.

Probably the funniest marvel movie too (sorry guardians/ragnarok) but this movie made me laugh, cry, and had me on the edge of my seat. Thank you Russo brothers, thank you Kevin Feige, thank you to all the cast and crew I LOVE YOU 3000",10

Infinity War was better...,29 April 2019,"But I don't want to nitpick around here so it's the best ending possible. The 1 in 14 million versions.

But I'll start with what didn't work. Firstly, captain Marvel. Why is she even in this movie? She's totally unnecessary and she really felt like a hero from the next generation where the villains are way worse than Thanos (hopefully).

Second, Hulk transformation is delivered in dialogue only. The complete reverse of show, don't tell.

Second, quantum realm. Everything make sense, there's no obvious plot holes if you believe the character's explanation on how things work but it's a little bit disappointing and it's not as straightforward as in the previous Avengers. Personally, I liked the focus on Thanos in Infinity War, he didn't come as shallow as other villains but in this one the focus is on the Avengers and Thanos is reduced to the villain that conveniently overthrows the heros' plans.

It's the classic superhero movie, only bigger, better, more awesome than ever. I was glued to the screen the whole 3 hours but still, I will remember Infinity War forever. And this would have been amazing (and completely different) movie if they just show how superheroes continued their lives after the decimation of the Universe without being able to do anything about it. Instead we get a fitting closure for the heroes that started the Avengers and we are ready to move into a new Era.

This Movie has Fan Service For Days,28 April 2019,"I really want to try a make a decent review about this movie but I can't seem to come to a conclusion whether or not I can definitively like it overall. As far as the plot goes it seemed like a real cop out way to solve all the problems while also leaving as many doors open as possible for future ideas. The story does a terrible job at being able to stand by itself in the cinematic universe as there are so many call backs to past films. Fans who have seen all the movies will have a blast but those who are not familiar with the 21 movie lineup will be left out of the loop. I have to recommend refreshing yourself with some of the significant entries in the universe to fully appreciate the spectacle you are about to see.

Like I said in the title this movie has so much fan service that you can't help but leap and yell they actually did that! Of course I will not mention any of it but it had to be said that they get a freaking A+ for adding as much as they did in one jam packed movie. I am honestly trying to express my feelings about the beautiful ending but no matter what I type, it feels as though I am going to give something away. I will keep it short and say they made it so sweet, sincere, and heartbreaking that this may be where some fans will stop watching and say ""this is the conclusion I wanted""... well of course in actuality they won't cause the MCU is awesome but the thought will cross their mind. :)

Overall I have decided that I enjoyed watching this entry but still prefer part 1. Mainly because it is concise and straight forward; you really have to be open minded and go with the flow in part 2 which I didn't enjoy.",7

Epic,4 May 2019,"""Avengers: Endgame"" is a satisfying, expertly made sequel in the franchise and combines with ""Infinity War"" to create the MCU's best, most compelling storytelling. I think that this movie raises the bar so high that there may well never be a superhero movie to match it as it stands out as one of the most detailed, satisfying conclusions to a chapter in a long-running franchise. All the necessary heroes get the right amount of screen time and there is a great blend of grief and humor. ""Avengers: Endgame"" is a beautifully-constructed piece of popcorn cinema and anyone who has given their time to this world will find it to be a rewarding and effective payoff. The word epic is the right one for this movie. The end. nikisreviews.gr",9
Good but not as good as infinity war,26 April 2019,"So let me start of by saying that the movie was good. But it was not as good as Infinity war. The movie starts off very instant and with no real lead to the previous one. It also has a very slow build up i mean literally nothing happens for 75% of the movie. I wish they would have made more happen during that 3/4 were as in infinity war they had stuff happen all the time from start to finnish.

I can also add that cm was absolutely not needed for this movie.

Pretty bad review i know but that's my honest opinion and a rightful one. People praising this movie to the stars are blinded for sure.

It's a good movie in the sense that it's watchable and has some fun and good times mostly with Thor and then a goodbye that leaves you with tears.

But nothing compared to Infinity war.

Very lengthy,12 July 2019,"For some reasons I didnt find it as good as its predecessor. Story was average ,at some point it felt it is not moving at all. Linking movie with the pre sequels is very bad specially for those who are watching Marvel movie for the first time. Acting is by far the best from all the characters and bringing back all the characters together in one movie was a great task by Marvel Universe. All in all this movie is not for non-marvel fan. If you have been an ardent fan of Marvel Universe ,this sure will be a joy ride.",7
Tremendous let down - soooo many plot holes and character assassinations.,7 January 2021,"After the great lead in from ""Avengers - Infinity War"" I expected an equally well written and logical conclusion in this movie. That did not happen. When I saw the ratio of 10's to 1's in the ratings for this movie I had to ask myself ""Did I watch the same movie as the people who gave it a ""10""? Who are these people that think this movie is the best thing they have ever seen? I could spend many paragraphs laying out the problems with this movie, but you should just read about 10 -15 of the other reviewers who have given this movie a ""1"" rating to see what I am talking about. Same level of disappointment as Game of Thrones final episode.",1
The real definition of catharsis!,5 May 2019,"It's been a week since Avengers : EndGame hit movie theatres. Since then, I've been trying to wrap my mind around the idea that it is really over.. This week saw EndGame breaking long-held records and creating new ones. It has made 1 billion and over $900 million worldwide! Almost everything that could be possibly said about it has been already said. Like so many others; nevertheless, I was and am profoundly emotional. I've always studied catharsis yet for the first time, I lived it. EndGame showed me the true meaning of catharsis; it purged me. It was beyond what I expected and I expected phenomenal! It was an experience like no other, a masterpiece. I laughed, cried, cheered and cried some more.. I was a complete emotional wreck towards the end. I was a ten-year old boy again. It took me to a journey which I've been part of. I was nostalgic. I saw myself in every piece of it. The movie was a capsule of memories.. This is history, the world came together to witness an end of an Era. All shapes, ages, sizes, colors, religions and genders. It was a national event! Marvel showed us how movies should be made. I've loved Lord of the Rings, I've loved Harry Potter, I've loved Star Wars. But I have LIVED the MCU. We can never be thankful enough for what you've given us. From a small kid who watched Iron-Man in 2008 with zero expectations to the man who watched EndGame three times after a week of its premiere! It was not easy for Marvel to start the MCU. Marvel had to sell some of their rights to other studios in hope to start the MCU. Things didn't go quite as planned. Therefore, Marvel gambled its rights to all of their characters to get a loan of $500 million to start the #MCU. It was a risk worth taking. A well-earned success; not only for Marvel but also for the fans, myself included. From the bottom of my heart, thank you Marvel, thank you StanLee, Russo brothers, Kevin Fiege, writers, producers and actors. Thank you, Robert Downey Jr. the one who started the game and the one who finished it. He created one hell of a legacy. I never want it to end, but ""Part of the journey is the end."" I am really grateful for being part of that journey. I love you 3000",10
Spoil Alert!,28 October 2021,,10
Extremely Satisfying Conclusion of this era of the MCU,27 April 2019,"***There will be NO SPOILERS in this review***

AVENGERS: ENDGAME is an emotionally and artistically satisfying conclusion to 11 years and 22 films of the MARVEL CINEMATIC UNIVERSE.

Closing out ""Phase III"" in the MCU, the concluding chapter for most of the ""original"" MCU characters/actors, ENDGAME picks up the Avengers story right after the conclusion of AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR - a film which saw our heroes lose the battle to Thanos, who snapped his fingers and half the living beings in the Universe vanished.

Instead of downplaying the grief that a survivor would feel, Directors Joe and Anthony Russo (veterans of many MCU films) wisely decide to ""lean into"" this grief which gives this film something that is surprising for a SuperHero film - emotional resonance. You grieve with these characters that you have come to know - and love - and share their pain and sorrow.

It's a wise choice for it adds a layer to this film that many Superhero films fail to achieve. Along with action, fun characters that you want to root for, interesting visuals and (are you listening DC?) - HUMOR, this film has ""all the feels"" (to steal a phrase) and will leave the MCU fan (both hardcore and casual) satisfied with the experience.

Also...interestingly enough...this film stands on it's own quite well. The guy next to me in the theater was a ""newbie"" to the MCU, dragged to the theater with his friends to be ""part of the crowd"" in this experience. Over the first 5 minutes he was asking his buddy a million questions about who is who and what is what...but after that he just settled into his chair and enjoyed the ride for what it is - even jumping up and cheering at a spot late in the film where EVERYONE in the sold out IMAX showing I was in was tempted to jump out of their chair and cheer (yes - there is THAT kind of moment in this film).

There is also sorrow...loss...joy...relief...tension...excitement...as I said...""all the feels"". I don't usually tear up at movies, but I felt some glistening in the corners of my eyes and a lump in my throat on more than 1 occasion - sometimes with sadness, but, sometimes, with joy and exuberance. Yes! I had tears of JOY jumping out of my eyes at a few moments in this film.

But, if it is Special Effects spectacle you are looking for - no worries. There are PLENTY including a finale that is worthy of being the Final Battle in the Final Film for this Phase of the series.

And...the humor...this film has a surprisingly large amount of light, happy moments as well. I give the Russo Brothers - and the MCU - credit for realizing that humor is a good counterbalance to sorrow, action and suspense. I also give them credit for what character they decided to use as the ""comic relief"" in this film. It's a good choice - and the performer tapped to play the humor is equal to the task.

But, of course, none of this matters if the characters aren't interesting enough to root for - and this film has it in spades. We've watched these characters grow, develop, bond and tear apart over the course of these past 11 years, so there is quite a bit of emotional investment in the characters - and this investment pays of handsomely (again...if you are a ""casual"" fan or a ""newbie"", you'll be fine). But...if you are like me and are ""into"" the MCU then there is payoff after payoff in this film that is extremely satisfying.

The actors in ENDGAME are, of course, at the top of their game. They know they are capping a special moment in their careers and they ""bring it"". Starting, of course, with Robert Downey, Jr. as Tony Stark/Iron Man. His character goes through a wide variety of emotions through the course of this film and - if this is his last MCU film - he's going out in style. As is Chris Evans as Steve Rogers/Captain America. These two are at the heart of this film - and at the heart of the MCU - and they take center stage with aplomb, tweaking their characters while respecting all that came before. To be honest, I never really bought into the Iron Man vs. Captain America ""Civil War"" storyline, but they tie that up nicely.

Of course the other 4 ""Original 6 Avengers"" - Chris Hemsworth's THOR, Scarlett Johansson's BLACK WIDOW, Mark Ruffalo's BRUCE BANNER and Jeremy Renner's CLINT/HAWKEYE/RONIN - are on hand and they all have their moments and take their bows as appropriate throughout. I also have to give some ""props"" to Don Cheadle's James ""Rhodey"" Rhodes/WAR MACHINE - kind of an unsung performer in these films and is a welcome sight who would have been missed had he not been there.

The other ""survivors of the snap"" - Bradley Cooper's ROCKET RACOON, Karen Gillan's NEBULA and Paul Rudd's SCOTT LANG/ANT MAN - fit in with the ""original"" Avengers quite well. This group of 10 is fun to watch. Add to them Brie Larson's CAPTAIN MARVEL to mix the drink and the concoction was intoxicating to me. A small ""quibble"" and I do mean a ""quibble"" - Danai Gurira and her character OKOYE is underutlized/underused for my tastes, but...that is just a ""quibble"".

Oh...and James Brolin is back as ""big bad"" Thanos - a worthy adversary, both emotionally, intellectually and physically for this group of SuperHero's to outwit/outlast/outplay.

Finally...without giving away any plot points...this story figured out a way to reflect on/pay homage to previous films in this Universe. It was a clever way to bring back stories/characters/moments from the past and to give some of these performers and moments a nice ""cameo"" curtain call.

I better stop now before I give away plot points - needless to say I LOVED THIS FILM - it was a very satisfying way to say ""thank you and goodbye"" to 11 years (and 22 films) of marvelous film making.

I'm looking forward to what the next 11 years in the Marvel Cinematic Universe has to offer - the bar has been set at the highest level.

Amazing,24 April 2019,Too be honest I didn't think marvel could top what they did in infinity war but they have just exceeded expectations and brought out the biggest and greatest movie I have ever watched,10
No more sequel,5 May 2019,,10
Josh brolin is a remarkable thanos,25 April 2020,"Josh brolin is a remarkable thanos. He captured the character very well . The emotions , expressions and most of all being the villain in the MCU",10
The story went on and on....,2 August 2019,"Well must say,i didnt watch the movie when it hit the theaters and althought i am a big fan of the franchise. I didnt expect a lot, thought i must be a slower pace to tell the story of the world that was created, yet.... it was damn to slow and borin. Without the death of Nat and Iron Man it would be like a Hallmark production. And even the final battle scene was like a copy paste from the last Averngers. Than Captain Marvel was like 5 sec to see, the funny part was only Thor and Hulk?! What the hell was that? I never liked Mark Ruffalo as Hulk but i let it pass, but here in the last Avengers... am actually glad i didnt get to see it in the cinema, would habe been waste of my money",6
I Loved it 3000...,27 April 2019,"What an experience that was..all those 11 years and 21 movies were leading to this one epic, satisfying and emotional conclusion..Overall the Movie is a Masterpiece...I feel very lucky that I was a part of this Universe that Marvel created..",10

Certainly some plot holes in this movie,14 May 2019,"Convenient how they had managed to come up with a time portal disregarding the fact that one of the infinity stones had done just that. This movie is overrated, and pretty much not worth the trip to the theatre.",3
Ignore the haters,3 January 2020,"I'm writing this month's after it was released, months after I saw it in the theaters. I saw it opening weekend. And honestly I've never felt that way coming out of a movie before. So many emotions, all swirling in my heart and head at once. It was utterly overwhelming. My personal experience was intense but based off the reactions of the rest of that theater crowd, so was everyone else's. I like to watch a movie multiple times to see how it stands up. Watch for plot holes, inconsistencies, watch the acting again. See if things seemed forced or ingenuine. See if it brings up emotions again and again. Today I'm watching it again. Still I feel the anger, sadness, grief, excitement, and thrill! The performances are amazing (although I'm not a fan of a blended Bruce Hulk being) and the pain they go through is gut wrenching. No it's not perfect. Yes it's heavy, and the first 1/3 to 1/2 of the movie doesn't really have ""superheroes"". But that's why it's so powerful. They are broken, just like all of the universe is. They are human, struggling in an existence that doesn't make sense and they couldn't stop from happening. They miss their family and friends. The last 1/3 of the movie is the perfect way to end this story. Very well done. Compared to so many others out there lately, this one got it right.",10

Hugely overrated and quite frankly a huge disappointment...,2 May 2019,"I am usually a really big fan of anything marvel but seriously what a crappy way to end this saga... Why did the writers need to add in all of the SJW rubbish in the movie? And what's the go with captain marvel? Terrible casting, made me dislike the movie even more... And ruining Thor? He's usually one of the most enjoyable characters to watch. And they turned him into a useless drunk. I really don't understand the high ratings.. Please don't believe the hype.",3
Perfection.,4 September 2019,,10
An epic conclusion to the memorable Avengers series!,29 April 2019,"Avengers: Endgame is probably the most hyped and the most anticipated release of 2019. Marvel's Avengers that has continued to entertain and wow us for so many years has finally come to a conclusion that has all the World held in its thrall.

In the previous movie, Avengers: Infinity War, we saw Thanos erasing half the population including many of our favorite Avengers from the planet and in this film, the world is still trying to grapple with the loss. I will not reveal the plot but suffice to say that the story while a bit slow in the first half had me glued to my seat throughout. The twists and turns are so well planned that nowhere did they seem predictable and lest you breathe or break concentration, you will find yourself missing the many memorable moments in Avengers: Endgame.

Everyone right from the Avengers to the supporting characters from previous movies of the Avengers franchise make an appearance here and what an appearance it is! You will feel like reuniting with family after many years of separation and left with a heart full of a myriad of emotions- happiness at meeting them again, sadness at knowing that this will be the last time we meet them and satisfaction that many of our beloved characters get their happily-ever-after.

Avengers: Endgame is a movie well planned and expertly executed. The joy of having all my beloved heroes and heroines at one place is beyond words and the feeling of loss knowing I will never see them again together is heart-wrenchingly real. Stan Lee's last cameo of his life and the last in an Avenger's movie was so beautiful that it brought a smile to my face as well as sadness to my heart.

I stayed off social media lest I accidentally read a spoiler until I watched the movie! A movie that not only wraps up the Avengers chapter beautifully but also justifies each second of the three hour-long story, Njkinny recommends Avengers: Endgame to everyone. Go watch with friends, family or alone. Don't miss out on the unforgettable feeling of seeing an exceptional saga of heroism, friendship, love, and sacrifice come to a memorable conclusion in this film.

Super shiny 5 stars to it from me and this is a movie that I can watch again.",10

I get that it's all doom and gloom with what happened in the last movie, but u don't drag that out for 2 hours. Main acts becomes sideshows, story is a mess. Put in a bit of woke and u release it. I will not rewatch this.",4
AMAZING !!!!,12 May 2019,Growing up with the Marvel universe may sway my opinion a bit but this is one of my favorite movies. It balances all of the characters extremely well and never gives too much screen time to one character. The plot is just the right amount of complicated and just the right amount of funny. Avengers Endgame is perfectly balanced.,9

Over hyped but good movie,27 April 2019,Move was good but not great. Lots of plot holes and movie felt way too dragged out. No real surprises since you saw everything coming. My son and I would rate this as the 3rd best Avengers movie. Infinity war being better and the original.,7
MCU nails it again with connecting the storylines!,29 April 2019,"I watched Endgame in IMAX with Laser and it was nice. This resulted in bright images, especially the oceans, projected by dual projectors on the giant 42 feet high, 65 feet wide screen of IMAX, completely using the whole screen with a little of chopping the picture. The images are larger than life, but they don't confuse the eye or strain the vision of the audience. Along with 12000 Watts IMAX proprietary sound system that was used very well for the sound editing!

It may have taken 11 years, 21 films but Endgame finally has shown redemption Connecting and linking this movie with the past films is not easy and smart direction from Joe Russo and Anthony Russo. It is not only about superpowers but about love commitment, compassion and sacrifice. Tony Stark removes his ego and Steve Rogers finally got what he wanted.

The only con of this movie was the running time. The three hours could have been scrapped or at least an interval to go to the loo.!

My score= 8.5/10",8
"Overwhelming, slow at times.",6 May 2019,"Didn't meet expectations which were pretty high to begin with after infinity war.

Avengers: Endgame,21 May 2020,"Going through the past scenes is a great review of Marvel's 11 years of film history. Both feelings and laughter can fully enjoy every detail or forgotten. When the lost comrades gathered up the All-Star team again, all the foreshadowing broke out with emotion at this moment. In those days, the six member team now has thousands of troops, and it is a miracle to go to this stage. Two pillars and two curtain calls mark the end of an era",8
Good but not THAT good!,27 April 2019,"Hmmmm I tried to go into the movie without high expectations, well as much as I could so I wouldn't say I was disappointed but it just wasn't was good as it could have been.

Don't want to give anything away so this will be brief but the pluses are great action pieces, plenty of time with our favourite avengers and it ties up all the loose ends perfectly!

The issues: Its about an hour too long, takes way to long to get the motive and planning out the way before our hero's actually get about fixing the problem.

Similar to Return of the King after the climax of the movie we spend far to long summing everything up and being all reflective.

There are some odd character developments which feel a bit like Last Jedi type changes - hmm is it a Disney thing.

It does struggle a bit to involve everyone at times - lacking the concise sharpness of many of the stand alone character movies. Overall it is a good movie for sure it's just not as awesome as the likes of Black Panther, Ragnorok or Captain Marvel.",7

Some folks who aren't with us anymore, so it's bittersweet to see them. I would definitely watch this movie again. Watch closely because it foretells of some things to come. I like when movies drop little nuggets like this. It gives you something to look forward to.

Crammed fun that can't be avoided,24 April 2019,"Honestly, I think there are too many Heroes for one movie so Thanos definitely helped us out. That said, the writers do exceptionally well to weave all the back stories, relationships, characters and emotional hee-haw together in one crazy 3 hour rollercoaster ride of CG action, emotion and gags.

Great fun but I yearn for the simpler single hero movies of yore, even though I still think the first Avengers movie was the Greatest!!!

That said, this will break every box office record as it is a MUST SEE!!!",8
Overwhelmed,2 May 2019,"Before Endgame, The Dark Knight Rises was my best superhero of all time. But now without any doubt I can clearly say that this is the best movie ever made. Every single second of my life that I've spent watching this movie worth it. The ending made me a little sad but I think every journey has an end.",10
Humangous End for A Thundering Start,27 July 2019,It's was one of my best Experiences ever. It's a memory that I will share with my childrens & Grandchildrens,10
Avenges infinity War,28 August 2020,"I gave infinity war a 4 out of 10 for a variety of reasons. But the main reasons were that the ending wasn't conclusive even for an MCU film, and the villain's goal seemed extremely contrived. His goal even seems ridiculous to me within the realm of typical superhero villain motives.

I felt annoyed that no hero character ever tried to intellectual argue with Thanos about his plans. No one ever asked why Thanos he couldn't try to use the infinity stones to make more resources rather than fewer inhabitants. Or why he felt that every planet was identical to his home planet in needing half their inhabitants to die, given the evidence of each planet have distinct differences problems.

Nevertheless, I like the story idea of half of the main characters dying and needing to be saved by the other half. I just felt that a more unhinged villain or an accident could have been a better excuse for such a mishap occurring and needing to be resolved in Endgame. I was especially annoyed at the point when they nearly had the glove off Thanos before losing focus.

But luckily Endgame is about solving the problems of Infinity War, and that story is a lot more fun and acceptable. Even if it involves time travel, at least none of the characters act buzzards like the physics of this alternate world.

Endgame is the longest MCU film at just over 3 hours. But for me it only feels slow in a couple places.

The story also provides some great reminiscing by reuniting all of the original Avengers and eliminating quite a bit of the clutter of so many characters within the last film. Only Ant-Man, Rocket, and Nebula really join the original 6 Avengers characters for the bulk of this film. The film's smaller cast allows for some more focus and growth for Tony Stark, Thor, Hulk, Hawk-eye and others as they each deal with their new normal differently.

Even though the film turns out to be a time-travel movie, it also doesn't try to be like the typical time travel movie where changing the past impacts the present and future.

The writers use time-travel more as an opportunity to scavenge things from the past and bring them to the present. It's sort of like the past is an alterable mirror reality they they discovered how to interact-with. This does lead to one annoyance for. The writers seem to disregard this narrative near the end when they decide that they must return the stones to where they took them. But overall I excuse this inconsistency because the sequence where they go back in time is very fun and provides for an interesting unexpected conclusion in the end.

Like other Avengers movies the dialogue is often funny and the cinematography, music and acting are great.

Overall I also given the film bonus points for really being a different kind of action movie then I ever thought I'd ever see. And I appreciate them deciding to not feel obliged to keep all of the characters alive forever. I like even good epic stories to eventually have some endings and conclusions. And the writers seemed to understand that in endgame.

Overall it's a great ride. And I imagine if it's watched immediately after Infinity War it might make both films collected average about a 7 out of 10. I just with the infinity war would have been as good as Endgame. That would have really been something special.",9
Amazing,25 April 2019,Just amazing. The humour combined with the emotional turmoil makes this one of the greatest films ever. I didn't think there could be a fight scene as intense as infinity war...I was wrong. Just amazing!,10
Everything we could have wished for.,24 April 2019,"The perfect conclusion, that pretty much sums it up. Over ten years and more then 20 movies led to this moment. Similarly to Infinity War, End Game had a lot of hype to live up to, and it did so seemingly effortlessly. The story, which on paper sounds quite simple, get the stones back and fix everything, takes some unexpected turns here and there and I have to applaud the filmmakers for making it so damn entertaining. The movie shines in being extremely funny, heartbreakingly sad and also filled to the brim with pulse-pounding action. The cast, which we know so well, all work with each other seamlessly. Special shoutout to Robert Downey Jr for giving by far his most vulnerable and amazing performance as Iron Man thus far. The climax of the film is one for the ages, similar to the final battle in Return of the King. The special effects, the score and the editing were naturally amazing, nothing less than expected from what these filmmakers have given us before. There is also plenty of fan service, sometimes a little too on the nose, but the plot and the characters are treated with the respect the Russo's have earlier shown to have for the franchise. Whatever turn the franchise takes after this, it will probably be exhilarating.",10
It's Good but Definitely NOT Epic as propagated - It's an elaborated Novel over the grave of a Comic by STAN LEE,30 April 2019,"As a Fan I feel Like cheated by Marvel Studios. Avengers: Endgame is a cut paste collage of previous movies & sloppy VFX ( one can watch it under magnifying glass when its Blu Ray is released). Within 3 hours of this movie 1.5 hours was of repetitions. After all the hype, theories & speculations, All that Anthony & Joe Russo cooked was a plot that even a Kindergarten MCU fan could've scripted better and Many succeeded with their far Superior imagination & theories than MCU team. Time Travel is a pathetic excuse to deal with Thanos after all the wonderful Avengers Series MCU has executed on Cinematic world Arena. It felt like they knew Endgame would be the Big Hit so they served the old potpourri with not more than 10 minutes of WOW action moments. Stan Lee's demise affected the outcome of this Movie that could have been the Milestone for Cinema Entertainment for Years to come. Wonder if this is highest Peak of MCU's Success Story. 6 Stars for many disappointments",6
I don't understand all the 1 star reviews,17 April 2021,"Even though infinity war was better this movie was still amazing. I like everything about this movie! Even the time travel part which is considered quite lame. And for some reason I can only see 1 star ratings, just WHY!",10
I like Infinity Wars a lot better,18 August 2019,"It's hard to criticize Endgame, given its enormous success. It certainly had its moments, the scene with Hawkeye and Nat was incredible, and the closing scene was really cool, it really made the viewer feel like he was part of the Marvel pantheon. But I wouldn't be in any hurry to see it again, and I watched Endgame 4 or 5 times. I've heard the latest Spider-Man gets the Marvel universe revved up again, so that will be fun.",7
I AM DONE WITH THE MCU,21 June 2019,,4
Never before and never again,29 January 2023,"Never before has a film had such a build up of character development spanning so many characters over such a long period of time and so many films. It's truly an amazing feat and with so much build up it would have been easy to fumble, but the Russo Brothers really pulled this one off. Amazing plot with the perfect amount of fan service and pay off built in. I will never forget the reaction and experience seeing this at the cinema.

This film has me in tears every time I watch it and ties up the infinity saga perfectly. Love the ending Captain America gets which is well and truly deserved. All round perfect film.",10
My Favorite superheroic film,23 January 2020,"Just best the end of Infinity saga for me. There is everything - comedy, drama, and an intricate plot. I can't imagine how to do better.",10
Perfect conclusion,9 May 2019,,9
Definitely worth getting into MCU movies,5 July 2021,,9
Perfect culmination of a generational saga,30 April 2019,"After all this time, after all the movies, after all the laughs and battles we finally get to witness the end to the biggest movie saga of our lifetime. Never before has an endeavor so grand been accomplished and achieved. Avengers Endgame lived up to the expectations and all hype. Per usual Marvel form Wndgame provided a wonderful story filled with action, plenty of laughs and more stars than we could keep track of. This movie gave me chills and had me wondering what would happen next. I know phase four of the MCU is in our future but this culmination of over 10 years of movies was the pinnacle for me. I doubt Marvel will be able to top this story. I won't be spoiling anything here but just know there will be plenty of laughs, tears and tense moments. It's a fantastic ending to the Avengers story. Or is it?? Can't wait to see what comes next.",9
PERFECT,27 April 2019,Absolutely incredible and creative movie. It takes risks beyond our minds and gives the fans a movie to enjoy.,10
Too long and too much brie cheese,9 May 2019,"Endgame fell short of being the fantastic end that everyone wanted it to be. It had a really slow first third and just when it got going the writers cram some sour brie cheese down the audience's throat, jarring the audience off the edge of their seats. In a repetitive pattern the main characters are constantly thrust situations of peril to be ""saved"" by the timely annoyed arrival of brie cheese. As for the rest of the cast this movie was great well preformed and exactly what you want in a marvel movie up until the next serving of brie cheese.",7
Avengers Endgame Spoiler-Free Review,18 July 2020,"Probably the best 3 hours in movie history. A cinematic experience everybody should experience. Exceeds expectation, 'nuff said.",10
Ok but mostly a disappointment,25 December 2021,,6
Overrated,20 May 2019,Not sure what all the fuss is about. It's no way an all-time top ten film,1
Trust me....,27 April 2019,You don't need any review to watch this one buddy. 😂😂😂,9
Satisfying send-off.,25 April 2019,"The rumors are true: you'll laugh, cheer, and will probably cry several times because I did. A middling first 2 hours that's equal parts cool moments and problematic ones that ends with a final hour that's a downright divine geek wet dream. More character-based than action-based (Infinity War). It is a satisfying send-off and a beautiful love letter for the fans. Salute to the founding members- the OG 6. I love you 3000, Avengers. Thank you, Marvel and Russo Brothers!",8
Amazing,23 January 2020,The movie was awesome. The battle and sacrifices with the twists that I definitely didn't expect. By far it was amazing to watch.,10
Absolutely awesome film.,9 May 2021,"This film is awesome, simples.

The ones saying it's rubbish etc are just trying to be 'Edgy'.

Don't read the reviews. If you like comic\super hero films, then this is a must.",10
Unsatisfactory ending to the MCU,11 June 2019,,
Best ending for the infinity saga,1 August 2019,This movie was the best avengers movie and I think it wrapped up the Captain America and iron man storyline very well. This movie was very emotional. The movie did not feel like 3 hours long it felt like a one hour movie . Overall great movie and great Characters really enjoyed it.,10
PREFECTION,13 September 2021,"Prefection x 100.

I mean we have reached the ending of phase4 perfectly so intruged to see what else is in holds.",10
Movie is well made but lot of loopholes,27 April 2019,"I think they could have made it better. Overall still a good watch. It is fun and a good spectacle, but storyline could have been better.",7
It's a perfect send-off for the 3 Avengers,23 February 2021,,10
An end of an era for us.,24 April 2019,,7
stupid movie,14 June 2019,"Worst movie i saw this year boring mess,plot holes,too cheesy,bad writing",1
A lot longer than it needed to be,24 April 2019,"I'm not a huge Marvel fan, so I don't know if I'm missing anything, but it was decent.

But, it was far too long and I struggled to sit through the last 45 minutes or so. If they cut out all the filler, it would've only been 2 hours long, not 3. I also didn't like how the scriptwriters and filmmakers couldn't really work out if they wanted the movie to be serious, emotional and epic, or filled with a hundred funny but silly jokes to pad the run-time.

Regardless, I still enjoyed it. The plot was good, the jokes were funny, the CGI was good, and the soundtrack was decent. It was definitely better than Captain Marvel.",
Infinite Saga,8 August 2019,I don't know what should I say.. Time travel in this movie has problem. But this is the best quality of this film,10
I was so glad that I got to see this...,11 August 2019,,10
Perfect,21 May 2019,"The movie kept me excited and entertained for the whole 3 hours. There was not a moment of me taking my focus of the movie, and that's what good movies do.",10
Amazing But heartbreaking For Iron man fans,25 April 2019,,9
Very good!,24 April 2019,,8
Emotional roller coaster,26 April 2019,,10
Not as epic as you would expect,29 April 2019,It's an ok movie but do not go in believing all the hype and expecting a perfect movie... if so you will probably be disappointed...they should have cut it down about an hour and it would have been much better,6
Good things must come to a end,25 April 2019,,10
Over hyped,25 April 2019,"Slow and ponderous with little or no character development or display of the talents they are supposed to have until the end of the film. The plot or storyline is simple and dull. I fell asleep in the film and my only regret is that I woke up and then had to watch the rest of the film, boring and predictable and will not engage you if you have a mental age of over about 16 or under",6
very boring movie . request dont waste your money,29 April 2019,I slept during movie first time in my entire life.I can bare any kind of movie in my life but this was litery garbage movie. My humble request is to stay at home give time to ur family dont waste money on this movie.,1
GOOD!,8 November 2019,"First time you Watch it it's awesome, second time you watch it its good.",8
Best Marvel movie,26 April 2019,Just watch it as many times you can laugh cry shout Surrender to the perfection called marvel,10
The perfect end to an era,3 May 2019,"A culmination of character arcs, narrative threads, a decade of cinema history, and like so many films in the MCU before, the guiding theme boils down to this: ""Everyone fails at who they are supposed to be; the measure of a person, a hero, is how they succeed at being who they are."" No doubt, I have my quibbles---""I amâ¦an Avenger"" would have kept something of the parallelism, but with a deeper sense of growth and better ethics---and some confusion, but at just over three hours long while carrying the weight of so many franchises, that is to be expected. At bottom, having already invested so many hours and years into these characters and these films, these stars and these stories, the mark of success is the emotional resonance and historic importance pushing the possibility of the medium (and its economic footing) forward, not the cinematic flourishes or compelling performances or memorable quips---that the film has a few of those, too, is merely a bonus.",9
Spoilers?,4 May 2019,,10
Just WOW,27 July 2019,I don't know what I'm feeling after I finished the movie should i cry or being happy or what!!,10
Ultimate Fan Service,24 April 2019,"If you've seen the Marvel movies, this is their Thank You to all the fans. They didn't care much for the logic or story. They just wanted everyone to feel happy.

And they did. I'm happy. Everyone in the cinema was clapping at the end credits.",10
need explanation,29 April 2019,,6
Very satisfying,5 May 2019,"This movie is revolutionary In what it has done. This movie was able to make a satisfying end to the biggest cinematic universe ever. There were many things in the movie which wouldn't normally be given a pass, however for such an ambitious project,most people-including me, were willing to turn a blind eye. This was a great movie for what it is meant to be, and I believe it achieved all it set out to do.",9
"Thanos would be disappointed, this movie is far from perfectly balanced.",26 April 2019,"The Marvel Cinematic Universe has given us a lot of great characters and pulling of a final movie that uses all their unique abilities equally was always going to be a near impossible task. Endgame is proof of that. It didn't feel like the Avengers became a real team or learned much during these 22 movies. Their plans and tactics felt amateurish. I was hoping for something deeper and cleverer, but that never materialized. It was entertaining, well produced and acted, but for me it never got near masterpiece territory.",7
Do not waste your time or your attention on this,1 August 2019,,1
Even more than the movie itself...,27 April 2019,"If you're a Marvel fan, this movie literally has everything. Nothing is left out. No stone unturned and all are cared for with incredible deftness. To weave together 21 movies into one HUGE and epic finale, while very properly tying up loose ends, is just beyond impressive. The cheers, the sacrifices, the resolutions, all are so very well done for this type of genre. This movie entertains on a scale that ""hitherto"" has never been seen. Lol. No other movie franchise has come close to matching the MCU magic, and none ever will. This was very special and a masterful piece of comic book action movie making.",10
Perfect,22 November 2019,Avengers endgame is the perfect conclusion for 10 years of history,8
Avengers Endgame,3 November 2019,,9
Incredible,25 April 2019,A masterpiece of incredible Heights. Some of the scenes were sensational with emotional tones that carried so much weight,10
A movie to be remembered,24 April 2019,"This movie keeps you at the edge of your seat, especially on the second half of it.It will make you cry,shout,scream from excitement or frustration and even clap as if the movie is going to bow it's head and it almost feels like they knew you would act that way, with the right pauses at the right time. Even at its worst moments, the movie feels just good, not even reaching mediocrity . Ofcourse every movie has flaws or mistakes or a plot hole, but this movie does so many things right that you just don't care. Can a movie be perfect?No. Can it be amazing and worth watching over and over until it's engraved in your mind though? Yes it can and this movie is one of those. Those that will be remembered for generations to come.",10
amazing....superb,26 April 2019,"Very little it happens that what you expect ,and what you get is more than your expectation

The end is perfect , doesn't want to spoil the this movie with some comeback

Perfect and spectacular,26 June 2019,"This movie is everything. It's funny, sad, heartbreaking, heartwarming, and so amazing. Stunning visuals and storyline, Endgame is basically a must watch and it was a wonderful experience for me watching it.",10
A Perfect Ending To The Infinity Saga,26 April 2019,"Its finally here. The moment we've all been waiting for. Avengers Endgame is now in cinemas and you should go watch it right now. I don't know how many times I plan on watching it but it is worth every penny no matter how many times you plan on watching it because it's that good. Forget good, it's great. Forget great, its spectacular.

Avengers Endgame takes place immediately after last year's heart-stopping Infinity War cliffhanger where our surviving heroes are in grief of what happened and the rest for you to watch. This is by far the best Marvel movie ever made. Endgame is the conclusion of a journey we've all been going throughout 22 movies. It is a worthy end to the original six Avengers arcs, leaving space for our new superheroes to take their place and lead a whole new generation of Marvel-lous storytelling. But let's not talk about the future, we are focusing on Endgame here.

Unlike Infinity War, the stakes are higher, the drama is wells up in you constantly and the sheer epicness of what makes this Avengers installment so perfect is that from beginning to end, you will laugh, cry or have goosebumps all over your body. The highlight of the movie was, of course, our beloved six original Avengers, Captain America, Iron Man, Thor, Hulk, Black Widow and Hawkeye. Making them the main focus once again after so long was a step at the right direction and it would totally make sense since we all know that Endgame will be their last movie together. The best among them all was Robert Downey Jr and Chris Evans. Finally seeing them together after havoc that was Civil War and working together, trusting each other again was an absolute treat for all us fans.

I can't tell you anything about the storyline for that I would be spoiling you but I can tell you the 3 hour runtime was worth it. Come to think of it, it didn't feel like I was watching it for 3 hours for that I wasn't bored or looking at the time. No scene felt pointless or draggy. The entire 3 hours keeps you attentive, at the edge of your seat and makes sure your eyes do not get to miss a single second. The pace seemed familiar to all famous fantasy epics such as Lord of The Rings and Game of Thrones. Like LOTR and GOT, they focused more on character development and getting the audience to experience what the characters going through as well. With that, there are the epic battle scenes and the epic score to go with it. Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely outdid themselves making their most complicated and best Marvel script ever. Alan Silvestri returned to write the score once again and outdid himself by including themes from all the previous movies including his previous scores from Captain America The First Avenger and the main Avengers theme by making it them sound more brassier and bigger, fitting the to the scope and tone of Endgame.

So, Endgame. Go watch it. Marvel fan or not, do not miss the epic finale to the Infinity Saga of the MCU. If you do end up missing it, you should live under rock or kill yourself with a rock. With that I'm rating Avengers Endgame 12/10 because it exceeded all my expectations of a great Marvel movie. I thought Infinity War was spectacular but Endgame, there is still no words I can find to explain what the movie or how it made me feel, not only as a Marvel but as a moviegoer which makes Endgame even more of a superhero spectacle than Infinity War.

P.S. unfortunately, there is no post credit scenes or end credit scenes",10
Magnificent,4 July 2020,"I don't care what any critic has to say, but the MCU is brave and brilliant. This interweaving, interconnecting series of 22 films (23 with Spiderman Far From Home) has gone from strength to strength and I absolutely love Endgame as it basically closes the curtain on the Infinity Saga.

The Marvel Cinematic Universe works because it is character driven!

When Cap wields Mjolnir, I basically nearly peed in my pants with excitement.

Bravo Marvel for breaking the mould.

I cannot wait for more",10
My first 10/10 action movie ever (No spoilers),25 April 2019,"This movie is what it was meant to be. It is not an easy choice, to make a 3 hours movie. The material has to be good for the intended audience, otherwise the movie becomes trash. This movie will go up there with Titanic and The godfather part II as movies that fulfill their objectives to the point of perfection and how long it takes to do so. To more hardcore MCU fans like myself, a warning: Be ready to cry.

After Captain Marvel many (Including myself) started to question the decision to make that movie and bring that character so late on. They made it work.

Time fly while watching this movie. Have a good time!",10
good movie,15 January 2022,"I'm prepared to instantly label Avengers: Endgame as the best of the 23 Marvel Universe movies especially the part when the all come back it gave me goosebumps like crazy.

GOOD JOB GUYS.",10
EPIC!,1 April 2022,,9
"It's was an event, not a movie",31 May 2020,"This ""movie"" acted more as an event to be remembered as the one of the most build up films of all times. It's full of fan service and predictable character interactions. I did like that it really got people ready to see the movie and talk about it and create theories, but nothing more.

Besides the event part, The actual ""movie is pretty mediocre. The acting and cgi is fine, but the plot and writing are almost as bad as Game of Thrones season 8. As a semi spoiler the movie also relies heavily on time travel, which is a horrible plot device in any movie, (unless that's what your entire premise is about). The rest of the movie: sets, costume design, lighting, and action (real movement/choreography) were all fine.

Overall I think the ""movie"" will be remembered as a HUGE and fun event of the 21st century, but looked upon also as a weak sequel to infinity war and a mediocre ""movie"".",6
Well hear me out first,9 September 2019,It was a good movie it just didn't need to take 3 hour,8
Overblown,14 September 2020,"Although this is the usual Avengers fare it comes nowhere near the quality of the previous MCU outings. There are just too many characters in it. Hardly anybody gets a chance to develop. As much as I enjoyed other MCU movies, this one just felt like a bit of a chore. And the final half hour was just grindingly hard work as the camera worked its way through so many Marvel characters, that I wouldn't have been surprised to see all the X-Men, Daredevil, Jessica Jones and the full cast of the Beano thrown in for good measure. But it's still watchable - just.",6

Great.... But disappointing,1 May 2019,"I know I gave it a 9/10 but there's a reason for that there are 2 epic scenes in this film that deserve the 9/10 rating, but the movie overall was 7/10 maybe a little lower 6.9/10, I just expected more, this morning or started great and surprising, but then the middle was lost and messy to say the least the ending was epic though,",9
"My youth, the beginning of my superhero, is over",22 March 2020,"Although the movie was 3 hours long, no one was willing to leave halfway through.

We know that the mission of heroes is to save the world, and even to give up their families, lovers, children, friends. Goodbye my Stark, goodbye my Natasha.",8
Like,19 January 2022,,10
Amazing!!,25 April 2019,What a way to end 10 years of marvel! Prepare yourself.,10
My mind is blown!,25 April 2019,"First off, hats off to the Russo brothers, they have crafted something spectacular. Something that will be remembered for years. It isn't easy to make something like this. To culminate 11 years of movies, 21 films, and do it by tying things together, honoring the fans and most importantly honoring the characters. Yet the Russo's have pulled off just that. I've seen it twice now.

Now before we get into the positives, let's get the nitpicks out of the way. (Don't worry I won't spoil anything). The movie isn't perfect, but is damn near close. Some aspects of the first act felt sort of rushed, but I suppose it was necessary in order for the film to touch on all the aspects it had to touch on. Even though the climax is absolutely mind blowing, there are some decisions they decided to make in regards to a character that I felt could have been written differently. At least that's what I was thinking while watching it, but the film's final moment made me forgive all of it. There are some other minor nitpicks here and there, but I'm not that kind of person, so let's get into the positives.

Believe me, it's hard to discuss this movie without getting into spoilers, but I'll do my best. The first act is a little slow, but at no point did I feel bored(some people might, BUT NOT US). This act was necessary to establish the dire state of our heroes and of mankind in general following the events of Infinity war. This part of the film definitely focuses more on character development as well as drama. The film then really gets going, and my oh my were they successfull with the middle act. They did a great job of honoring everything that lead up to the endgame, and the comedy was perfectly sprinkled throughout. I won't say much more, as this review is already getting long. But I have to state again that this is an epic (and I mean EPIC) conclusion to the infinity saga. They make some bold decisions. You will laugh, you will cry, and you will definitely be satisfied. The whole theater clapped as the credits started rolling.

What a film, check it out no matter what. Thank you Joe and Anthony Russo.",8
Endgame marvel climax,25 April 2019,Marvel Avengers Endgame is a combination of 10 years of Film making. It is viewed by many critics as been a top film of the year. Went to see it for Tom Vaughan Lawler as he is a great Irish actor. We see ups and downs. Like most comic book movies it falls flat in the final third of the film. If you are taking your kids to see it don't three hours is a lot for children and trust me they won't sit still. To conclude Endgame is the Endgame for cinematic crossovers possibly,6
Superb,29 June 2020,"I think that this film gets a good ending for the infinity stone's saga. The battles, the great amount of characters and the plot itself are the bests to end this saga and continue with a new saga of the MCU.",9

super movie,19 January 2022,"The film ""Avengers: Endgame"" not only continues the acclaimed and large-scale film comic Marvel's Avengers: Infinity War, but will also be the end of all the so-called first four ""phases"" of this movie universe. It is assumed that after this picture, the world of Marvel is waiting for a completely new development, and the ""Saga of the Infinity Stones"", which began back in the first Iron Man, will be completed. The new film will also feature Captain Marvel, whose backstory is worth exploring in a solo adventure. Put ""Final"" Avengers brothers Russo. And the music was again composed by Alan Silvestri (First Player Ready, The First Avenger, Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb). The flick of the Tanos glove wiped exactly half of the entire universe into dust. Now those members of the Vengeance team who survived must work together to repel the mighty titan.

Problems: too many characters and some appears only for few seconds with only a sentence. Thanos lost all his meaning and became a ''classic villain''.

I hated the smart Hulk and Starlord.

P. S. This is a superheroe movie his aim is to entertain more people possible and gain by it. Who says that ''It's not Cinema beacuse has not meaning behind and teach nothing'' is at fault.

A comic and a book as '' War and Peace'' are different but if you read one you should not laugh of the other.",8

For passers-by, this is a business masterpiece with self consistent logic, orderly rhythm and proper arrangement. For fans, this is a youth farewell ceremony with supreme feelings.",8
Totally disappointing!,4 October 2021,"After Infinity War you expect smth special and brain-blowing to end the story. But this is a typical Marvel ""fight-explode-green background"" film.

You are in the endgame!!! (Spoiler FREE),25 April 2019,"This movie has everything that fans wanted in MCU, a pure tribute to the previous stories and most satisfying completion of the saga. It is funny, emotional, thrilling, action packed roller-coaster ride. Three hours run-time never felt long, it went by very quickly. I could have happily watched even longer version (I demand a longer version ;) ). The Original six truly shines in this one and great characterization. Stark is just awesome as always, as does Rogers, Thor, Banner, Barton and Romanoff. They started this adventure beautifully and ended this with a bang. Since this is a spoiler free review I won't delve into the conclusion of their individual character arcs but Cap's is although satisfying but still bothering me. There maybe many things which will make more sense or less after more viewing but for now that's all.

A suitable conclusion to an epic tale of comic proportions,27 April 2019,"The story was well written, seeded with humorous as well as tearful scenes. It tied together the multiple stories of it's legendary characters with decent closure.

"A satisfying and emotionally gut-wrenching conclusion of 22-film culmination within the Marvel Cinematic Universe, with heartbreaking, superb, and thrilling stakes and twists",28 April 2019,"After 11 years and with 22 films being released in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Avengers: Endgame reaches a satisfying and emotionally gut-wrenching conclusion that delivers a larger spectrum of heartbreaking, superb, and thrilling stakes and twists, combined with every powerful performances within the entire ensemble cast, a wide-ranging display of emotions and depth, a masterstroke screenplay, storytelling and direction, a suspenseful and thrilling musical score, and a coherent and nuanced visual effects, sound design, pacing and editing. Avengers Endgame ultimately serves as the shining pinnacle and an outstanding finale tribute to the Infinity Saga within the Marvel Cinematic Universe that all started with 2008's Iron Man.

While Black Panther remains as the unique, phenomenal, and inspirational masterpiece of the MCU and a cultural significance; Avengers: Endgame is something more of just being a masterpiece but a phenomenal legacy and a magnum opus, not just within the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but throughout the entire cinema, of all which it ties with other classical cinematic masterpieces with great endings such as The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi, and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 2.

Without any doubt, Avengers: Endgame truly serves as the greatest superhero movie alongside Black Panther, Logan, and The Dark Knight, as well as the greatest movie that will forever defined pop culture and modern cinema in years and decades to come.",10
Disappointing!,24 April 2019,"Infinity war had set up huge expectation from the Endgame. I was looking forward to the movie but I was mighty disappointed. The first couple of hours of the movie are really slow and dragging. The fight scenes are OK but seems hurried up. The story line is emotional but that is not the weak point for the movie. Some how it felt disjointed and underwhelming. I wish it was as beautifully crafted as the Infinity War. Not sure if we will get any more of Avengers in future , but hey part of the Journey is the end!. Thanks Marvel for years of entertainment :).",6

A little disappointed,27 April 2019,"I won't include any spoilers. I will say that Endgame fail flat with me. It was a good movie, but nothing close to Infinty Wars. There was no cohesion, the characters were not given that balanced screen time, the cleverness and timely humor wasn't there. The final battle scene was chaotic and didn't showcase enough of the Avengers talents, and what was shown was so fast paced it failed to make an impact. Even though it was a long movie, the entire thing felt rushed.

I didn't at all like how they portrayed one of the heroes. And I didn't get a feel for the next generation of Avengers. In fact, of of the most constant icon fans of Marvel movies are used to isn't there.

Also, I hated the music. I don't even remembere the famous Avengers theme song being played.

There was also quite a bit of predictability with the movie. And there was some dumb things the characters did.

Still, this is a must see for fans of the movies. The female empowerment thing carries over from Capt Marvel, but only somewhat. 7/10, and that's a weak 7.",7
A brilliant satisfying end to a fantastic franchise.,27 April 2019,"Well, what can I say? I am extremely lost for words. I won't spoil the plot, but all I can say is go see this film!!! It's going to be hard to say goodbye to the actors that played the iconic original six Avengers characters. You would defiantly feel bittersweet while watching the film. I laughed, I cried, I gasped!

Not super good.,22 May 2019,"Even whilst watching it, I felt disappointed: slow, wordy, sloppy storyline.

An epic ending to an epic saga.,15 November 2023,"Avengers Endgame is the ending that the series deserved, a beautiful global battle between the forces of good and evil, a shame only for the fate of Iron Man (Tony Stark) but we know something needs to be left behind before continuing. The solution to the previous extinction was a bit complex but in the end our heroes managed to bring 50% of the missing back to life. From then on it is a showdown against Thanos and his followers. As I was saying, the final battle is exaggerated but fits well into this context and brings all the characters from the series onto the battlefield, without exception. Some hints of sadness arrive at the end but a high rating is confirmed for this film, certainly a memorable film for Marvel fans.",9
Spoilers free,26 April 2019,Been a marvel fan all through eleven years. Watched every single movie on the opening day. It has The perfect ending. You would leave the theaters with a heavy heart for sure but with content that you've witnessed something truly amazing. I ve gone with a high expectation of course but they crossed it.

Not upto the mark............,5 May 2019,"Being the final chapter of Avenger series expectation was very high. Especially because of the superb success of the earlier chapter, ""The Infinity War"" which was undoubtedly a joy to watch. Since the bar was set so high it was not that easy for the movie makers to surpass the hype. Thus in the final chapter makers lack the finesse . There are flaws as the movie was very slow in some parts and it was very lengthy too. Moreover, though it's all fictitious but still the ""Time Machine"" concept looked pretty ordinary. The Iron-Man tragedy was also pretty dramatic and illogical. Otherwise the movie does well. So overall.......... not upto the mark. Expected a lot!!!",6
Simply Incredible,25 April 2019,"11 years ago when iron man came out who would of thought we would of been here? 20 films later and were in the endgame. Simply incredible, from beginning to end, a feat of cinema. The humour, the emotion, the nostalgia and the satisfaction the movie brings is truly special. There is no other film like it, Stan lee would be proud-heres to another 10 years, excelsior :)",10
"Poorly made, actors look tired of acting, wasted opportunity",27 April 2019,"Obviously anyone who has spend years watching MCU movies would go to watch Endgame with high hopes. I went with a hope to have a logical but entertaining end to the saga. I was disappointed. These are my impressions: Movie is 3 hour long but 50% of time is wasted on whining actors who have all but given up after their losses (during the previous movie!) Guys, we already know what happened there, now move on. Film makes these heroes pitiful, sad and tired looking humans- Thor is epitome of what I mean. Well, we have enough of those in real lives and we don't show up at 11 pm to watch that! Storyline was silly and predictable. I wanted to see the re-match between Avengers and Thanos but that was poorly done and I don't even understand how it abruptly ended!

Positives were some funny moments.",6
I don't know about this one,29 April 2019,"If you've been loving the MCU films recently, then this will probably be your favorite one yet. It's absolutely jammed packed with material, and the more MCU films you've seen, the better it'll be.

However, the movie is dragged down by an extensive runtime, and jokes that miss the mark. Endgame takes too long to get going, and then seemingly never ends. And most of the humor is hit or miss; it just feels out of place.

Overall, Endgame wraps up the Avengers ark reasonably well, but it's too arrogant and lacks any real sense of quality.",4
Wow the best movie I've ever seen!!,25 April 2019,This movie was absolutely perfect. There is nothing more I wanted in this film and it gave me all kinds of emotions that I've never felt in a movie Before! it had the most satisfying ending and it really did conclude the Avengers.

An Emotionally Satisfying Conclusion And New Beginning,4 May 2019,"Avengers Endgame is simultaneously the final chapter and a new beginning for the MCU. It brings to a close many of the stories and character arcs that have been built-up since the beginning with Iron Man. As a grand ending, is the film worthy? Yes it is. It's a great closing chapter as well as the start of something new. As a whole the film is good, though not without problems. I think this film is inferior to Infinity War, as well as the other MCU films the Russo Brothers have directed.

I thought the first forty minutes and the last hour of the film were fantastic. The acting is superb from everyone. The action scenes are great. The final fight of the film is the most phenomenal and rewarding action scene of the MCU or any superhero film. There's one scene involving Captain America that truly made me smile. With Cap being my favorite MCU character, this was my favorite scene of the film. The music is good. The effects are gorgeous. The epilogue is great. I loved what this film did for both Iron Man and Captain America. This was their film above all, and I was ultimately satisfied where their characters ended up at the end.

However, the middle portion of the film is definitely the weakest link of the movie in my opinion. The film is long; the longest comic book movie ever maybe. The first and third acts felt very fast, but in the middle portion I started to feel the length. It does get a bit boring. That's not to say the second act doesn't have any exciting or touching moments. It does, but it fails to live up to the first and third acts.

That's mostly due to my expectations and personal preferences. The film does go in a direction you would not have expected from the trailers in the second act. Honestly, this was the last place I would've wanted the movie to go. Not that the film does it badly, but this is a plot point that's been done so much to death in fiction, from movies, TV shows, cartoons, anime, manga, and especially comics. Most of the time it's used as crutch for writers to get themselves out of a corner they put themselves in, and I'm just sick of it. It's also something that's so easy to screw-up and makes your entire story convoluted. In this film they try so hard to make everything make sense, and it mostly does, but there are still a couple things that you call into question.

I honestly think it would have been better if they just adapted the original Infinity Gauntlet comic more faithfully. They should've introduced Adam Warlock and the universal concepts. That would've been insane. They even teased Adam Warlock in one of the past MCU films. I guess they're saving them for future movies.

There are also a few blatant logical issues. Infinity War had this too, mainly revolving around Thor, but this film even more so. One plot point near the end completely negates the importance of the Infinity Gauntlet itself from Infinity War. It does lead to arguably one of the best moments of the movie, but it's still a pretty big leap in logic.

The last major issue I have is what the film does with two major characters; Thor and Hulk. These two characters go through dramatic changes in this film. Now, these changes do make sense from a story sense. It wouldn't bother me as much if they did more in the film. Thor doesn't do that much until the third act, which is disappointing given how awesome he was in Ragnarok and Infinity War. Hulk doesn't contribute anything fight wise, which is even more of a disappointment. Hulk was barely in Infinity War, so I was expecting a big comeback in this, but that's not what happened.

Overall, Endgame is a good film, and a good ending/beginning chapter of the MCU as a whole. It's not my favorite MCU movie, or even in my top 5. It's definitely the weakest of the Russo Marvel films. The film is a bit long, and I would've gone a different direction with it. There's some questionable logic in the film, and I'm not a huge fan of where they took Thor and Hulk's characters. However, despite all that, I was mostly satisfied by the end. If you're a big fan of Cap and Iron Man like I am (especially Cap) their resolutions are emotionally satisfying. I almost don't want to see anymore MCU films after this because this wrapped everything up pretty well. Everything from the first Iron Man to now has felt like a giant continuous story arc, and now it has finally come to a close. It's the end of an era for sure.",8
Speechless 😍,26 April 2019,"What an absolute gem of a movie. It's not just a movie but a wonder of our times. You just cannot stop appreciating it. The cast, the director,producers and all the team associated. Bravo. You have produced a gem. Thanks for 10 years of love.",10
Let me put this straight. (spoilers free),27 April 2019,"When you have an excellent team, from producers, writers, screenwriters and good actors among others, comes the result in which fans come to the heading. I'm not going to talk about the movie or what happens, but one thing I can say is that this movie has to be seen as a whole Infinity War (begin) Endgame (end) two parts of the same story, and all the bows that are closed. Endgame is the end of a chapter and the desire for more, and I have no doubt that the public will complain for more of this Universe (MCU) so well worked, so well imagined, so well achieved.


This story is much more than a war of titans, heroes, super villain, is about something much more obvious, tangible. It's a well-planned amalgam of drama, action and maturing of various characters, it's all I ever expected from a good story.

I think it's an excellent celebration and conclusion to a phase of the MCU with a huge pile of emotions and a visual of biblical proportions - beautiful artwork this movie deserves an Oscar.

ps: I would like to know how Thor does that with a beard (understanders will understand )

Excelsior ~ Stan Lee

I have some minor questions and ""complaints"" about the absence of some events, when you do that in the characters of the franchising those fans will take it bad. Although I understand why they made it like we saw. This movie has a lot of things happening, tons of emotion and probably might need a re watch for those who don't like to miss the details.",10
One of the superhero movies ever,16 October 2019,"This movie is just straight fan service in my opinion, it's a fantastic payoff to the 11 years of the MCU. I think it's probably one of the best endings we could have gotten. But, there are many flaws, like the CGI. It has very good effects but it has way to much. About half of the movie is on a green screen. And I'm not exaggerating, it's definitely the most effects heavy movie in the MCU. That's just my opinion though. The acting is actually a lot better than I thought it would be and that sounds quite bad, but I was really impressed with some of the performances. Particularly from Chris Evans and Jeremy Renner. A lot more depth compared to previous movies. RDJ is great as usual but I still think his best performance is in Iron Man (2008), doesn't mean it's disappointing, just in my opinion is outshines by other strong performances. I think the length of the movie is actually good as it's never really boring or slow. I think it's probably the second best superhero movie this year, because I think Joker is amazing. But it's still a very good movie but if I was to be honest, probably a little over-hyped, I think it's because it's a fan service movie and I don't consider myself an ""MCU fanboy"", but that view can very much change depending on the viewer. But yeh, really good.",8

Good but not sure what all the hype is about...,25 April 2019,"It may have just been the high expectations set by the reviews, but this movie is not as good as the internet is making it out to be. Infinity War, in my opinion, was a much much stronger film overall. This was very poorly paced, had some really bad attempts of humour, and a lot of unnecessary scenes. The actual plot was quite good and kept me engaged, but the execution was lacking. Don't go into the cinema with high expectations because you may be disappointed.",7
A bad way to end a spectacular franchise,18 August 2019,"I never did side with either DC or Marvel - even as a kid in the 1960's. There were superheroes I liked and ignored the rest. Now, while DC is showing us how poorly a film can be made (particularly ""Justice League""), Marvel has aced 60% of their 22 films to date in my opinion. I wish that was the case with this one. It not only underwhelmed me, it didn't serve it's predecessor well.

I certainly don't fault the cast because outside the handful of main characters, the rest were merely background and foreground. After Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, Hulk, Hawkeye and Black Widow, the rest of the cast were so many that they seemed like they were there for scenery. And like ""Justice League"", ""Avengers: Endgame"" suffered from the ""more is more"" syndrome that may please the under-10 crowd, but takes meaning away for us older viewers.

Let's not overlook the cop-out remedy in science fiction these days - the reliance upon time travel to get out of a script jam. I realize it was a necessity in this particular chain of fictional events, but after a while it seems like (pardon the musical reference) a long, drawn-out guitar solo that has you wishing the band would get back to the song.

This review isn't due to Thor (my favorite Marvel hero) growing fat and channeling his inner surfer dude, Tony Stark losing his life or Gamora 2.0 being the anti-Gamora. My regret is FOR the franchise instead of me as a viewer. They ended on a sad technical note due to unnecessary goings-on that I'm sure they worked very hard at trying to tie up in a movie.

Another point that detracted from this film, and a few others in the Marvel cinematic universe is their social messaging. They didn't need to preach woman power because superheroes already have that built into their character. Here, it's shoved into our faces to signal their fashionable virtuosity. In other words, if there is a female superhero in a film, I don't need to be reminded that there's a sexual revolution going on here in reality. Theirs are formidable personas without need to be underscored.

Using another musical analogy, this movie was like the members of Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin and The Who taking the stage at the same time and playing their sets. Apart, they're the best. Together, they're just noise. ""Avengers: Endgame"" would have been better if they pared down the scope, although I understand why they went the way they did. A franchise as successful as MCU set itself up for such a debacle. I'm grateful that it wasn't much, much worse.

I thank those at Marvel for bringing to life the characters I read about in comic books at the corner store. They did a very good job overall.",5

Last hour saved the day (spoiler free review),27 April 2019,"I'm not going to spoil anything. Overall, the movie was enjoyable, but those 2 first hours... So many plot holes. If you're someone with a minimum of logic and appreciate intelligent writing, chances are you'll get mad a couple times in the first 2 acts. However, that last hour was THE best segment I have ever scene in a superhero movie. It was really epic and everything you probably hoped for. It really saved the movie and boosted my rating. The rest of the movie would've been a 6-7 in my opinion. It's definitely not the best MCU movie like some hardcore fans are pretending it to be, but you still have to see the movie. The conclusion is very satisfying! You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll cheer. I even had goosebumbs at one point, and I'm not even a HUGE fan of the MCU. It's a must see. Enjoy!",8
What a ride!,4 May 2019,"One critic said this movie was a, ""glorious conclusion"". I say it was one nutpunch after another. So..... a glorious nutpunch? Take a hanky..a ton of napkins,....something ti blot the tears away. Trust me...you're gonna need it.",10
Excellent,17 May 2019,"Marvel have done such a great job at creating a broad storyline, that pieces together like a puzzle. This truly is a Marvel fans fandream movie. It does sag a bit in the middle. Some characters are a little underwhelming, Thors storyline was dull. I did feel like there was more invested interest in Captain America, because the Russo brothers have already built that character up so much.

But that last battle was amazing. It reminded me of the feeling I got when I first saw the final act of the Attack of the Clones, truly awesome!",8
Like a roller coaster of action and emotions!,26 April 2019,"I'd say the perfect end for this series even if the ending is a little hard to take. There is a ton of action - well made CGI - not too many mistakes in logic and heartbreaking moments.

Great movie,13 May 2023,,9
It's exactly what it looks like. amazing,1 May 2019,Though I have some issues with the way the last few years went with the Marvel universe (like the moronic identity political game they try to sell to us) this one was different while it is still there its easily looked over by the pure emotional build up that has been going for 11 years. I stand here saying that when I first saw iron man in theaters I could have never dreamt of such a thrill ride like this and with a near perfect ending.,8
Entertaining but predictable.,26 April 2019,Entertaining action and certainly comical interaction between characters but a disappointingly predictable culmination of many years and many movies.,6

"The MCU's riveting, moving, uneven crescendo",30 April 2019,"Let me preface this by saying that I definitely belong in the ""casual Marvel fan"" category; so feel free to take this with a grain of salt.

I liked watching ""Endgame"". It was clearly the more emotional of the Infinity saga, the villain was better handled, and there were times when I was firmly butt-in-seat for whatever came next. Did it need to crash the 3-minute threshold? Good lord, no! I never glanced at my watch (which I guess says something) but it's not without its draggy segments. And as much as I wanted the team to get back at the bad guy and make things right, I was more interested in the time-travel, fan service and movie-hopping than I was in the big battle scene.

Don't get me wrong; I know this is a milestone. Ten years' worth of franchise-building capped in one movie; filling the imposing shoes of vanquishing Thanos; raking in a billion dollars. It was less escapism for me than it was witnessing history in the making. That much was palpable. And this a good movie, but it's hard to say if it lives up the unbelievable hype.

For me, it's questionable.",7

However, she is barely in the film and I'm glad it focuses the OG avengers high-lighting their personal sacrifice and struggle in the fight against tyranny. This film effectively ties some loose ends with an impressive attention to detail but still leaves space for the Marvel universe to continue to grow and continue to brighten our lives.

Plot-holes galore!,7 October 2019,"It also has several plot-holes... They need to hire better script writers, since plot-holes like this are very easily avoided, yet they can ruin an entire franchise's continuity (which is exactly what has happened here).

Thanos snapped away half of all people right? To solve overpopulation right? Because his planet & people suffered from overpopulation right? SO WHY THE HELL would he then do what he did with the stones, in just a few generations the population of the galaxy will be back where it was and more overpopulated than ever? It's the most stupid plot hole ever.

Another HUGE plot-hole: There's NO WAY that a human could wield a single Infinity Stone, never mind all of them at once so that blows a huge hole in the whole last 30minutes of the movie and all future movies, since what happened is impossible. A human would die instantly if they wielded that much power.

Hire better damn writers!",6

Every Fanboy's Dream,18 May 2019,"I REALLY loved watching this epic conclusion to one of the most respected franchises of all time. With 'Endgame', this movie has exceeded all expectations for all Marvel fans out there. The Russos, Christopher Markus, Stephen McFeely, and Kevin Feige had a lot of fun assembling this billion-dollar-worthy masterpiece. It can get emotional at times, but it is worth all the fun. 'Endgame' has achieved the top rank that outshines every other MCU movie ever existed. The heroes can think, act, and react because of their challenges they had to go through.

For Marvel - keep up the good work.",10

...and many things are just too absurd ... Thor's storyline for one. Nebula's story line for two.

Acting was fine. Everyone was fine. But you'd think for a three hour movie there would be more inter-Avenger dialog, especially between Natasha and Cap and Clint and Banner because she's attempted relationships with all three and now that half the people are gone and she cries a lot don't you think any of the other three would want to have a relationship?

so basically, a rat saved the day. Not Hulk, not tony stark but a rat. oh, and time travel. it's like they wrote the scenario in 1 day, in rehab.

Amazing film! All out beautiful!,26 April 2019,"Loved it! Made me tear up many, many times. The cast did amazing!",10
Offers something narratively new to its known audience,2 May 2019,"The Marvel Cinematic Universe has always been stuck with certain limitations, such as a formulaic three act structure, not exceeding a pg13 rating and such. However this film, being a form of climax to the saga, offers something its audience hasn't really experience, at least from Marvel. This film is more narratively complex and interesting than all its predecessors. While watching you were quite surprised as to where are characters would end up next, this kept the picture thrilling and exciting throughout. The Russo Brothers have always bent the limitations to their will by keeping a good sense of what they're actually capable of doing. These limitations are annoying cause you really are not gonna get much of a different film to the last one or the next. But limitation breeds creativity. The Russo's have completely taken advantage of that and it shows in their films in the Mcu and especially here in Avengers Endgame

Obviously the writers had a say in what was actually happening and they did an amazing job at balancing the characters on their journey in this film. There were various plots with various characters that needed to have interesting chemistry or connections with one another, whichever worked best for the characters. It shows how carefully they understand the characters and care for how their stories will end or where they will go, and I appreciate that a lot personally. They also took many a risk with how the character interact with the tragedies and conflicts that have faced them, most notably Iron Man, Thor and Hawkeye. Each of those characters went through tremendous change and each ended up somewhere entirely different which is truly fascinating and entirely believable. Certain bits play for broken characters that you genuinely feel terrible for and other bits play for comedy and the blance is fairly consistent. I really like how this film is very messy and chaotic but the Writers and Directors guide us through it all, it's impressive.

It is entirely visually stimulating across the board, the cgi is some of the best ever and very carefull done, the characters have interesting looks that change often. It's shot nicely, that hendheld look they've had in the Russos films is present and plays for certain emotional thing, for example the opening scene. There was a certain shot just after the opening titles which, with context, makes you feel really uneasy. When it comes to the ending you really feel a sense of heroism and hope from an otherwise hopeless world and certain things happen that shock and aw and they come at just the right moment. It really delivers on a satisfying climactic battle. The character remains alive in everyone throughout the climax and makes you build up excitement and care for how this could end. It's drastically enjoyable and emotional. The finality for many of the characters, when things wrap up, completely delivers. Where the last film (Infinity War) left you with a bad taste in your mouth, this one does something different entirely and allows certain characters to progress and to end. I really enjoyed this film throughout and the build up made it all worth while. Although personally I've been frustrated and unsatisfied with most of the Mcu movies I'm overly happy with this one and any of the Russo Brothers films.",8
The Culmination of the MCU Franchise,25 April 2019,"This film is, without a doubt, not only the perfect conclusion of the current MCU Phase but also the zenith of the superhero - comic book genre.

Going into the movie theatre I had a lot of reservations regarding the way the aftermath of the Snap would be handled and if its result would be reversed in a way that would not render the events of Infinity War meaningless.

Needless to say this film managed to exceed all my expectations and perfectly show the repercussions of the Snap on the lives of our beloved characters, the gravity of losing their loved ones and how they sought to reverse what had happened.

The film's opening 30-45 minutes show the immediate and long term aftermath of the events of Infinity War on both the physical and mental state of each main character.

The middle act of the film is where I was pleasantly surprised in the way that the film manages to be both familiar and original at the same time.

There is a wealth of fan service without it becoming cringey or in any way lowering the stakes of the overall mission. There is also a lot of development and progression for the main characters (watch out especially for Tony's and the Cap's mission) in the way they come to terms with the lives they lead until now and what sacrifices may have to be made going forward.

The third act is exactly what you expect but even more. It is centered around an epic battle which is filled with sequences which will be remembered for years to come. Lets just say that it is an hour-long, action packed highlight reel filled with memorable one-liners and wow moments.

The end of the battle brings about a new world order for the MCU and bids a heartwarming farewell to some of our beloved characters in a way that feels natural and fulfilling.",9

The end of avengers.,14 April 2020,,8
It was a wonderful experience!!,2 May 2019,"Okay, I guess I have to say something now. Avengers Endgame! First of all, thank you so much to the whole team for everything!

I saw Avengers Endgame twice this week. And there is no way that I could describe my emotions for this movie.

While I was watching Avengers Endgame, the crowd applauded 3 times during the movie, and stood up to applaud at the end of the movie. And so did I. I cried 5 times during the movie. Not just me, everyone was crying in the theater. So I'm fully on my emotion, there was so many tears of joy and lost. I know it's a superhero movie but it left me speechless.

3 hours well used. It was a perfect ending of the Avenger Movies. So, I can't dispute its great conclusion. It's definitely one of the best Marvel films.

OMG! I laughed, cried and was speechless. I'm gonna miss this team. I love you 3000.",10
"A good end to the Infinity Saga, but not a good film",26 April 2019,"Avengers: Endgame is truly one of those films marketed to satisfy hardcore fans. Watching this film I truly wished that I was one of those fans and could receive the amount of satisfaction that they all seemed to have received from this.

As an outsider I feel like a lot of the humor was misplaced, a lot of the action scenes were dark and hard to see, a high level of predictability to the film, a loss of logic in a few of the plot lines and a really unforgiving run time. Also given that this movie has a lot of characters in it, there really is a big difference in some of their screen time and not in a good way.

Putting that all aside though there were some really good scenes, some of the jokes were hilarious and the overwhelming emotion of seeing all the Avengers from over the years finally assemble and give evil a true kick in the face was amazing to see.

I would definitely recommend seeing the film to form your own opinion and I am definitely glad that the creators gave their fans exactly what they wanted in this ending, as I would like the same sense of loyalty given to me for the saga's that I am I hardcore fan of.",6
"Met expectatioms but didn't surpass them, Infinity War was better",25 April 2019,"Perhaps it's because Inifnity War has gathered all heroes before and linked their stories before so it doesn't feel THAT exciting anymore. Yet, it's an amazing piece of art that represents the perfect bow for Marvel's MCU",8
Highly entertaining movie that makes no sense,2 May 2019,"There are no spoilers needed to back up the statement that 'Endgame' is the Swiss cheese of the bunch as far as plot holes and internal contradictions are concerned. Emotionally strong and visually impressive, it's one of the most entertaining movies in the MCU and cannot be missed by anyone who watched most of the others.

But unless you are already deeply invested in the MCU or simply have to know ""what's next"" after the (actually far better) 'Inifity War', or you're just here for the fights, tear jerks and explosions, this movie is entirely missable. You will be passing up the opportunity to endlessly pick it apart with your geek friends though, who will spend the next decade trying to come up with excuses to make this movie work.

It *is* after all the culmination of a decade of storytelling and it deserves credit for pulling that off. It's a shame that a movie that does such a good job of connecting everything, making it look so good, with so much star power, ends up being a plot mess and honestly lazy.",6

All good things come to an end,11 May 2019,"Well what can I say! I was late to the party with this final instalment on the Avengers franchise. Over the years I've look forward like a school kid waiting for the next film to come out,bland waiting to see what happens next. This didn't disappoint. I'm sure if and when I watch this film again I will see glimpses into other characters and films I haven't thought about it didn't realise as that seems to be the norm now. As ever a cheeky cameo from the creator to add a bit of humour to a sometimes very dark and serious film. Although that's the Avengers all wrapped up I feel there will be something else to takes it's place just around the corner.",8

The Hulk was the only disappointment, but Mark Ruffalo is a crap actor anyway so I expected that. I haven't seen the other one with the blond girl everyone hates but this one is a winner. Sit back and enjoy the ride I say.",9
"Great movie, but Infinity Wars was way better!",29 April 2019,"The title says it all. Plus this movie had toooo manyy flaws, which I am totally willing to ignore. Which movie does not?

But clearly they should have at least taken some more time and get their stories in sync and correct.",7
I wanted to like it. I really did. But it was boring.,1 August 2019,"If you like special effects then you will like this movie. If you like a good, intriguing, believable story with interesting characters then this movie may be very lacking in that department. The characters with all their interesting super powers just seemed to be a bore. Perhaps this sort of thing happens when you have too many main characters in one movie. There is no character development. One thing there is no shortage of is good looking special effects but it merely covers up the inadequacy of any kind of substance in the story lines and characters.

The story totally contradicts itself. I'm not going to post spoilers in this review but in the end it really looked like the writers just made up unrealistic stuff that did not make any sense or had any sort of believable realism. If you tell a story like a 3 year old, other 3 year olds are going to love your story but adults are going to be bored to tears.

They turned almighty Thor into a 3 year old, with mannerisms, intellect and all the traits 3 year olds display. But here we go again with Hollywood trying to emasculate men in all their latest block busters. Political nonsense that seems to be infecting and infesting big budget movies... It really just makes the world of Hollywood look all the more plastic.

Perhaps the extremely high rating of this movie made me expect something really good and entertaining but all the enthusiasm I had soon turned in boredom and mild resentment because 3 hours is a lot to spend on something that seemed to bring only boredom.",1
"Almost perfection, but everythin has flaws",28 April 2019,,8
Easily the film event of 2019!,30 March 2020,"Endgame follows on from the events of Infinity War which had possibly one of the most mind-bending cliffhangers in cinema history! I'm going to avoid spoilers on both films so very little plot details or characters arcs explained; just the comments on the structure and feelings it leaves with. It's the culmination of many Marvel storylines and has got to be one of the most anticipated films of all time for a loving fan base. It still manages to be surprising and my jaw dropped on many occasions; genuinely unexpected moments that are wonderfully done. It takes a lot of twists and turns with characters that really work and it's such a brave and exciting movie for doing so. It's running time is justified with the story taking place over three distinctive acts; the first very much focuses on grief, taking its well deserved time and exploring it and our heroes dealing with that. It's a really clever beginning as we see them at their most vulnerable and it reminds the audience that while being superheroes, they're also people with existential problems. The second act goes into more familiar territory and thrilling adventure, seeing a cool return from characters who missed out on the previous Avengers. The final act is just mind-blowing and delivers all that you could hope for from an epic series finale. There are a couple of character arcs that I understand why have frustrated some viewers although I personally found them laugh-out-loud funny as intended! There's also two character stories that are perfectly tied up and the past 12 years of Marvel films have a really beautiful ending here. It manages to not be all doom and gloom with a healthy dose of good humour while also having an emotional punch and some genuinely unbelievable set pieces. Huge congratulations to the entire team behind this project as it's just love for storytelling and spectacle embodied through cinema. It'll definately be even more rewarding on repeat viewings I think and I can't wait to see it again!",9
An emotional yet Epic ending.,26 April 2019,"No spoilers. This is it. What a huge tribute it has been. One of very few Hollywood movie which my eyes soaked in tears at the end of the movie. The greatest crossover movie so far in the cinematic universe, it's an absolute tsunami of epic. It's been an emotional, a feel of never ending grief for the characters you loved. Whatever it has taken for an Avengers, certainly taken emotions out of a child inside every MCU FAN. Standing ovation in a theatre, people clapping and shouting for their favorite heroes was a goosebumps moment. ""Avengers Assemble"" was an unimaginable and unthinkable.",10

Somewhat disappointing,25 April 2019,"I have to say that Endgame was enjoyable, albeit sometimes for the wrong reasons, yet this is to be expected when all the MCU is combined into this strange conclusion. The performances are very good, although one is left wondering what the point of introducing Captain Marvel was due to her lack of actual contribution to ""the grand plan"". I firmly believe that this could have been done better by postponing its release or splitting it into more parts so that the pacing, the tone and at times even the story wouldn't be so all over the place. However, I am glad to have seen the conclusion of the franchise and hopefully Marvel will continue to deliver great movies in the future.",7

Excellent ending to a 10 years saga,5 May 2019,,10
Nothing Outstanding !,29 April 2019,"Just saw so called and talked this movie. It is just hype and to say truly it is a movie that marks below previous Marvel movies. Because after seeing this movie your mind will be empty and you will be not satisfied with whole drama feeling that something was missing, yes thrill of superheroes is totally missing here. Reasons are following as me, others may have their own different opinion than me, but me, watch the movie only for full of entertainment with not much expectation. High rated tickets should give you full value of your money and three hours of life. High ratings are false and all are copying to support only for this average movie. Reasons are many; 1. The starting of last chapter is very slow and dull, whereas it needs some powerful actions or at least interesting incidents to keep viewers connect early to the story. 2. Hawkeye lost his family, how? And why not he lost himself ?. ( Thanos spares him?) 3. Planning to time robbery with quantum theory is very slow and time consuming only. 4. It takes too long time to start the real drama cum fight. 5. Time robbery is so confused. It is not cleared that how lost heros came return in life. What is that method was been applied not shown anywhere. 6. If Thanos is vanished by Iron man then how he will regain again to finish some superheros as shown in Infinity War ? Is there any paradox theories? Not cleared by director. Various time lines are so confused

7. In this such a big saga of returning our lost heros into life, what is the role of Nick Fury as he only show his face at final scene. As me he must have a major role for planning the time plan. 8. There is only a single fight, first and last with not impressive only lengthy and boring. 9. Such super movie must have solid logic plot and here Infinity War was better. 10. Nothing new plot. I actually wait till end to happen something different. 11. Captain Marvel has no significant role here even her character was created with a single separate movie to enter in Endgame? 12. Thor is shown drunkard with tummy belly. It is not acceptable as our hero is our role model. I actually feel shame to see such nonsense thing.

A very few things are good like CGI work, father of Iron Man, Natasha's sacrifice etc for name. Hulk's anger on footing stairs is just hilarious comical sequence. I really enjoyed it.

Acting is okay and no one expect good acting in such comics movies.

As me the movie is watchable but not for much entertainer. It is only deserve 7 star. And lovers of Iron Man and Natasha, don't be disappointed they will meet you in future because it is comics universe.",7

"Overall, a meh kind of movie",29 April 2019,,6
188 minutes of pure cinematographic torture,28 April 2019,,4
"First half, eh, second half worth 4K price",22 October 2019,"Avengers: Endgame is less of a movie and more of an event. It celebrates 11 years of superhero cinema while also commemorating itself as just a huge, huge event. As something like this, it works very well. As a movie, on the other hand, there are severe flaws.

Now that isn't to say that I hate Avengers: Endgame- in fact, I really enjoyed the film. However, as genuinely enjoyable as the second half is, the first half is slow-paced, lifeless, and drags on. Sure, that's the intention given the fact that half of life only remains, but that doesn't aid in the fact that it still feels a bit long and disjointed at times. It doesn't quite have a flowing narrative or genuine structure, it just plays out as a series of overemotional filler.

The second half (and the time travel scenes), on the other hand, is immensely fun and entertaining. I'm not here to talk time-travel mumbo jumbo so I'm gonna be ignoring those flaws, The climax and the aftermath of it are both incredible and really give the film its identity; a huge, grand-scale spectacle of a film and a sight to behold.

In conclusion, Avengers: Endgame is a far from perfect movie, but it's still solid and delivers a spectacular ending for not just itself, but for the MCU. It will go down as a classic, that's for sure, but for now, the MCU is a story of a lifetime.

Good but not great,4 May 2019,"At a first viewing I loved the movie, but at a second viewing I ""merely liked it""

I think the sentimentality made the first viewing so special, but then you see all the flaws. Still a very good movie and a satisfactory conclusion to many many hours spent in MCU:s company.",8

I loved the movie. I have some things that I don't really like but overall it is the best Marvel movie with the most perfect ending you can imagine. Well-done Russos.",10

Colourful entertainment with an expected storyline.,29 April 2019,"A fairly entertaining hero movie that, even with its long running time, doesn't really feel tiring. It begins interestingly and in pure Avengers style it becomes more and more chaotic as time progresses. This is a consequence of the too many storylines that need to be merged and the too many characters that are to be followed. Tonal shifts are omnipresent and a few characters are thrown out of context for the sake of unnecessary comic relief. With the story progressing, typical cliches of ending stories become apparent and unexplained convenient turn of events start to happen. This is nothing new and, as in the previous movies, sometimes it's just impossible to make sense of how and why a situation occurs. You have to accept it for the sake of the storyline be it someone suddenly becoming overpowered, acquiring a new power or conveniently stumbling upon a revelation. In the end, an unimpressive and quite predictable storyline spiced with great effects, a good soundtrack and a few interesting characters.",6
Only until a few days after,27 April 2019,"When you have watched YouTube videos from looper which explains the reasoning behind the individual characters endings and also the number of links to the previous films, do you really realize this was a real piece of art and one that may never be replicated again. What a way to end 22 films but also start a new platform for many others.....plus Disney now owns the rights to x-men and the avengers!!!!!!",10

Endgame,19 March 2020,"Avengers: Endgame, ends a saga that has been created since Iron Man released in 2008, the film starts as it should start in a breathtaking scene. Throughout the film we show how the world was after the snap of thanos, or what the universe of marvel calls: the blip, in the first act of the film focuses more on the avengers trying to reverse the snap of thanos and also has some very epic scenes and many references in the second act of the film, finally the war which we have waited for 11 years and 22 films. The final scenes are simply one of the best scenes in the history of cinema. Anyway, Avengers: Endgame is the biggest event in the history of cinema, the best superhero film in history and deserves the box office that it won, what I think is bad that Avengers was despised in the awards, but for Marvel it doesn't matter, for me Avengers: Endgams is a film made as a declaration of love to fans and an end of a cycle and one started a new.",8
You should have aimed for the head!,26 April 2019,Just got back from the midnight showing and I have to say I was pretty disappointed. I get that its the final avengers movie but they spent two hours paying homage to previous films and characters and retread a lot of the original plot. In doing so they effectively dulled Thanos's presence and much of the enjoyment of the movie. I hate to say it but Captain Marvel seemed like a useless addition as she really didn't bring much to the table and her presence ruins Thanos's threat. Anyway the production values were great and it was nice to see all the characters make an appearance in some form but it wasn't bet foot to go out on.,6
Wow.,6 May 2019,This movie did everything great. There were some brilliant moments where I got Return Of The King vibes and I was pumped out of my mind. They really surprised me with how they chose to play this one out and all I can say is the Russos pulled it off amazingly. Also the soundtrack was incredible with a spectacular final act.,9
Some surprises but meh ending,28 April 2019,,6
My Opinion,28 March 2021,"I hate it. Makers just have to make money, they make this worse in MCU and all superhero movies universe.",1
Avengers: Endgameis just the beginning,12 May 2022,"If you like fantasy, adventure, and superheroes, I suggest you watch ""Avengers: Endgame"". ""Avengers: Endgame"" - is an American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics. Released on April 26, 2019. Directed by Anthony Russo and Joseph Russo.

That's the most emotional superhero film, I have ever seen.

The film itself begins with an emotional scene where Tony Stark (Iron Man) drifts into space without food or water and sends a suicide message to Pepper Potts when his oxygen supply starts to conclude. Meanwhile, the remaining Avengers - Thor, Black Widow, Captain America, and Bruce Banner - must find a way to reclaim their defeated allies for an epic showdown with Thanos - an evil demigod, who destroyed half the living things in the universe, with the stones of infinity, thereby causing a terrible genocide.

Tony Stark is rescued by Captain Marvel and leads them to the other heroes. Tony Stark invents the time machine, thanks to which the Avengers can collect all six infinity stones and perform one of the successful finales of the 14 million right that Doctor Strange foresaw. And believe me, the ending will be full of emotions and will be remembered for the rest of your life, because for the Marvel movie universe it is only the beginning.

The film is directed by the Rousseau brothers, under the direction of Marvel. Anthony Russo and Joseph Russo are American films and television directors. The brothers make most of their work together. They won «Emmy» for their work on the comedy series «Slow Development». The brothers themselves said in interviews, that they wanted to make a film that would be understandable to a new audience, that had not previously been interested in comics or Marvel movies. I'm into comic books and Marvel movies, but I can tell you that the brothers managed to make a movie that would be understandable to a new audience. The film very clearly shows the characters and explains the story. The thing that amazes me the most, is how the brothers managed to put together a story that consists of 24 comics. They worked very hard because the comics were written at different times, from 1998 to 2012.

In my opinion, the most important factor in the film is Robert Downey Junior, who played an iron man. It's one of the main characters in the movie, but you have to see the movie to find out why. Robert Downey Jr. Has already appeared in Marvel films, such as ""Iron Man"". Also, I want to touch on what special effects are used in the film. I am very much as the space and abilities of the characters are transmitted to me. For example, beautifully depicted scenes, where Thanos uses the stones of infinity. In the film, the music is well-chosen, especially in touching scenes.

In the end, I can say that the movie ""Avengers Finale"" is worth your time. Although the movie lasts 3 hours and 2 minutes, it is perfect for those who love fiction and adventure. Special for those who read Marvel comics.",10
Near Perfection,4 May 2019,"Spoiler free review here.

If you are invested at all in any of the Marvel characters, than this is a must see. It was a perfect conclusion to the first three phases of the MCU and it makes us wonder where they can go next that'll feel new and fresh. Worth watching, ignore the haters and negative reviews. Sure there are plot holes but we're talking about a universe in which a guy created his own element and an entire country uses a metal as basically magic and says its technology. Every Marvel movie has plot holes, this one is no exception.",9

NEUTRAL FAN REVIEW: Good movie but not great,27 April 2019,"To start off, I am not a mcu fan and this review is completely non biased. First of all, the movie is not bad, nor great in my opinion..it's just an overall good film. The first half of the movie for me was very slow and laggy, however it picks up its pace later on. I haven't watched every marvel movie so I didn't really understand a lot of the references that were made so that was another downside for me. The way they handled Thor kind of disappointed me bcuz he is my fav avenger but it's ok bcuz he was kinda funny. The ending is the best part of the movie because the action, goosebump moments, and emotional scenes were done very well. Overall, I think they could have trimmed a lot of the first half of the movie bcuz 3 hours felt very long when there are a lot of scenes that didn't contribute much to the plot. However, I think mcu fans will definetily enjoy the movie much much more than a neutral like me. It's a good movie, trust me, but not the best. Give it a watch bcuz it won't disappoint you, that's for sure!",7
Thanks Marvel !,27 April 2019,"ENDGAME is the best movie I have been watched in my life. It is incredible, fantastic, wonderful, marvel and impressive. Thanks marvel to product the MCU 22 movies in 11 years and give us the great masterpieces of the world movie Avengers:Endgame",10
Good but not great,27 April 2019,,7
Mind numbing. I just had to turn it off.,10 August 2019,"I can never be bothered with reviews but this films rating is beyond a joke. Plot is awkward and ridiculous... even for Marvel. Acting is non existent. Direction and editing just feels amateurish. I couldnt deal with anymore after the 1st hour it was excruciating. It feels like they gave a class of children the old ""how would you end the avengers"" lesson and just put all the answers in a bag and picked one.... and then just made it work.... or so they thought. I may feels the urge to watch the 1st half again and hope it inspires me to watch the conclusion but its highly doubtful.",1

It's decent,24 April 2019,"Objectively it's a decent movie. But as someone who was simply BLOWN away by Infinity War. This movie just left me plain confused. There are so many giant plot holes. The script seems rushed. Not well planned out. And maybe the term ""snooze fest"" is a bit harsh. But the movie builds up really slow. Only to reach a point that is very predictable. For me, just too bad for it's potential.",7

Thank you Stan Lee, Kevin Feige, Anthony Russo, Joe Russo, Christopher Markus, Stephen McFeely, RDJ, Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Mark Ruffalo, Jeremy Renner, and all the other superheroes for this epic adventure! A job well done!",8
Gives you what you want to see...,26 April 2019,"And not in a good way.

This movie is one of the most ambitious movies to ever be made, that alone makes it a cinematic moment to be remembered, however this whole movie is eerily predictable. As you venture through the 3 hour flick, you are met with predictable plot points, very shallow and faux humor that tries to break tension, and a very lacking character growth from point A to point B. Sure, if you were to watch ALL of the 22 movies of the MCU you'd see the arch, but in this movie, especially in the main characters, we don't see a change during its run. Characters make decisions that dont really fit their personality and overall it just leaves the 3 hour venture shallow and dry. It is 2 and half hours of filler with really just two scenes of significance.

That being said, the visuals are great, the score is better than most Marvel movies and this is a great wrap to a disappointing Phase 3 of the MCU series",6
Is this the best movie ever?,28 April 2019,It was everything for me. The way they linked all the ends was marvelous. I found all the happiness and sadness at the same time. Love you Iron man 3000.

Very enjoyable movie,26 April 2019,Very good finishing and a lot of excitement. The death of IRON Man and Natasha Romanoff was too much painful.,10
A disappointing cliché,26 April 2019,"While superhero movies aren't all known for deep plots or very substantial storytelling, Endgame falls far off the Avenger's franchise and feels way too long and underwhelming. The tone of the movie is stripped down by the long shots and unnecessary plot devices, which are predictable and is a forced way to make spectators feel like it's a satisfying ending, which it definitely isn't. While some characters do get a somehwat satisfying closing, the story feels dull and without the excitement that prompted the other movies until now, every scene is stretched for far longer than it should, the editing isn't condensanding, and while one of the biggest points in Infinity war was the various events happening at the same time, this movie does exactly the opposite, it feels, overall, disappointing. It's not a horrible movie, but not even close to one of Marvel's bests and that's what's most disappointing about it, because it feels like an ending, but not like a closure.",6
Oké 1 week after watching end gane,30 April 2019,"What the.... did Disney do? I know the wannabe cinema fan will be like ""that was a well deserved ending""... Like how? The story does not add up.. Really does not make sense... The solution to try save everyone is like xmen day of the future past concept ""reset button""

The actors really Marvell this shows that Disney is loosing it with there political agenda? All the scenes she was in felt like a reshoot.. Like they had no plans for Marvell and it was forced! Thor... What a.... shame

Where are the times that you could actually expect spectacular scene action worthy moment.... Instead of a.... comedy show full of meme!!!

Let me tell you, it all worked and in a way I never imagined it would. The story was just so perfect. It had everything, from laughter to sadness and pure awe inspiring satisfaction. The ending was probably perfect. I was literally sitting in my seat with my mouth open from amazement from what I was watching. I truly believe this movie deserves an Oscar for best picture.",10

I'm glad others like it though, my kid who is 7 fell asleep 💤 at 1 hour, he asked me 40 mins in if it gets more interesting . When he awoke an hour later my answer was yes, but not much. Loved Captain America and the hammer, movie tingles in that scene. He might rate it lower?",6
One of the best movie ever watched,19 April 2020,"This is by far one of the greatest cinematic events in history. This film was just a pure masterpiece.

the final,19 January 2022,"Back in 2008, Marvel released the wonderful blockbuster 'Iron Man' and ushered in a new era of the comic book universe. Then no one could have imagined that the story would take on such a scale.

For several long years, Marvel Studios has been moving towards the final act, delaying the battle with the main villain Thanos, thereby intriguing the audience more and more. Here comes the 22nd Avengers: Endgame movie of 2019. It's sad to realize that this is really the ending of the Avengers, because I loved them so much ... It was also sad to realize the ending of the film, which must have touched most Marvel fans. When watching, I was overwhelmed with many different emotions, but mostly it was sadness, which sometimes resulted in tears, but not without tears of joy. In general, I am a rather emotional person, so I have always liked such films.

I can say that the Marvel studio does not change its interests and also shoot everything in colorful colors, which is very attractive. Also, their main feature has always been charismatic actors, where everyone is unique in their own way. And I liked the fact that in this part they collected all the superheroes from the Marvel universe. It's really incredible to see them all together!",10

For a normal, sane person this is a too wacky movie with a lot of weird twists. The only really good thing in this movie is the avengers theme song that gives the movie a little spark in the total darkness that it is in. If you consider watching this movie DON'T.",2
A review for an amazing film,15 May 2019,"As the continuation of the ""Avangers: Infinity War"" movie, this film was successful to make the audience feel very curious about the end of the story. This film tests whether you are really Marvelous or not. When you watch this film, you will feel every second of this film is a pity to miss. Three hours duration of this film feels nothing for me, even I wish it could be a little longer.

A continuous story from previous films makes this film very interesting to watch and also difficult to predict the end of this film. Anyone who might miss the previous Marvel films related to this film might not understand the parts related to this ""Avengers: Endgame"" film. I think the camera and sound effects is perfect. Each of actor and artist successfully plays the hero character entrusted to them very well.

A good teamwork is very highlighted in this film. This film teaches that the optimism in achieving a goal, even though it must pass a big challenge. When I watch this film, I feel touched by the struggle and the sacrifice made by the team. Every scene from this film has its own meaning, even It's not hesitate to shed tears for some sad scenes. I want to watch this movie again and again because i just want to say that this is one of the best Marvel films. If possible, I want to give 11/10 rate for this amazing film.",10

Initially, i was concerned that my expectations were way too high, but I was proven wrong as soon as the film started, keeping me engrossed for the entirety of the 3 hours I sat watching it. Utterly breathtaking. And it's not like those films that keep you guessing and don't give you w conclusion, this film does exactly that. At the end it really does give you the endgame.

The problem is that i have to have motivation to watch it and that's because it's 3 hours long

i'm just saying if they tacked it along side avengers infinity war and sold that in stores, that would be the golden ticket move.",9

Right out of the gate I was absolutely floored, I had very high expectations for this movie and it still surpassed them by a huge margin. I was not prepared, you can't predict or imagine how incredible this movie is. Calling it a movie doesn't even do it justice. This is an EXPERIENCE. It blows every other MCU movie out of the water, while still honouring the legacy. Thank you Russo Brothers, no one could've done anything like this. Words can't describe how fantastic, epic, insane, cathartic, shocking this is. A true GIFT to the fans. Seeing it opening night in a jam packed theatre full of fans was wonderful. We laughed, cheered, and cried together. So many moments absolutely blew my mind and currently thinking about them again is giving me shivers and making my heart leap. THIS MOVIE IS FUNNIER THAN YOU EXPECT. I laughed so much! It didn't feel forced either, the humour flowed really well with the emotion. I cried tears of joy way more than I expected, and tears of sadness. But this movie was the most satisfying possible ending, I left happy. I did not think I'd leave happy. I have literally just one complaint and it's so small I can forget it. I'll need to see this a bunch more times to soak it all in. My heart is full, and I will cherish this first viewing of many, forever.",10

From the start of the movie you're immediately reminded of the ending of Infinity War, thrust in to the affects of Thanos' snap, from this moment on the emotional ride begins. The movie manages to perfectly balance the action, plot moments, character arcs and character conclusions, and paces you along the way. From the get-go, you think you have this all figured out, what's going to happen but most of you will be wrong.

The Russo brothers manages to bring this heavily invested universe to a close in what could be considered the greatest Marvel film to date with the largest ever assembled cast. I cannot recommend you see this just once however, the 3 hour run-time that this movies demands is warranted and satisfying but make sure you go to the toilet just before you watch it.

And just to save you the time; this movie (fittingly) has NO after credits or mid credits scene.

Unfortunately they all are cookie cutter films, look, taste, feel the same, nothing really sets it apart. My 2 biggest issues with this film were did it really need to be 2 3/4 hrs long. I figure with a good film editor they could have clipped 25 min and not ruin the pacing, the second is Bree Larson. I just find her unlikable. Downey, Hemsworth great as always. Would love to see Hemsworth, take on the 007 role once Craig retires. Last cameo for Stan Lee.Endgame isn't a bad film, just nothing really special about it either. I can find more fulfilling ways to spend 2 3/4 hrs.",6
"Not just a movie, an enthralling experience",28 December 2023,"Caught ""Avengers: Endgame"" and, whoa, it's a cinematic masterpiece!

No spoilers, promise. The movie is a rollercoaster of emotions, action, and nostalgia. It's like a love letter to every Marvel fan out there. The stakes are high, and the payoff is even higher.

The character arcs? Brilliantly done. You see sides of these superheroes you've never thought of. The humour is on point, and the camaraderie is heartwarming. And that soundtrack - epic!

Without giving anything away, the final battle is mind-blowing. The Russo brothers nailed it. You'll be on the edge of your seat, I guarantee.

It got some good moments (milking the sadness of defeat) and some clever and inspirational lines (which I think is very important for superhero movies that mcu a bit lacking). Sometimes the jokes came in the way of the emotional moments thou. Felt a bit uneven overall. Hope for so much more from Capt Marvel but ... And bit sad looking at Hulk and Thor become victim of plot. It's quite a mixed feeling movie for me. Just an ok I guess?,6

"Freaking amazing, what an end to the journey",19 November 2023,"Avengers: Endgame is nothing short of a cinematic masterpiece, a triumphant conclusion to over a decade of storytelling in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Clocking in at just over three hours, this epic saga manages to balance heart-wrenching emotion, exhilarating action, and a profound exploration of the superhero genre, leaving an indelible mark on the landscape of blockbuster filmmaking.

The film begins in the aftermath of Avengers: Infinity War, a narrative cliffhanger that saw the universe shattered by the mad titan Thanos. Endgame wastes no time thrusting viewers into a world mourning its losses, setting the tone for a story that is as much about resilience as it is about superhero heroics. The stakes have never been higher, and directors Anthony and Joe Russo skillfully navigate the complexities of a vast ensemble cast, giving each character their moment to shine.

The brilliance of Endgame lies in its ability to juggle multiple storylines without losing focus. It seamlessly weaves together narratives of grief, redemption, and sacrifice, offering a nuanced exploration of what it means to be a hero. The emotional weight of the film is palpable, and the performances from the ensemble cast, including Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, and others, are nothing short of exceptional.

This movie puts a huge commitment to character development. Over the course of numerous films, we've witnessed the growth, flaws, and evolution of these iconic characters. This capitalizes on this investment, delivering payoffs that are as emotionally resonant as they are satisfying. The arcs of Tony Stark and Steve Rogers, in particular, come full circle, providing a sense of closure that is both earned and poignant.

The film is a visual spectacle, with breathtaking action sequences that push the boundaries of what is possible in the superhero genre. The climactic battle in the third act is a masterclass in scale and choreography, a jaw-dropping sequence that brings together heroes from across the MCU in a showdown against Thanos and his forces. The Russo brothers orchestrate these scenes with precision, ensuring that the action serves the narrative rather than overshadowing it.

Endgame is not just a film; it's a love letter to MCU fans. It's filled with callbacks, Easter eggs, and references that reward long-time viewers for their dedication. The meticulous attention to detail in the script, coupled with a reverence for the source material, demonstrates a deep understanding of what makes these characters and stories resonate with audiences.

Alan Silvestri's score is the emotional backbone of the film, underscoring key moments with a musicality that elevates the storytelling. The use of silence in crucial scenes speaks volumes, allowing the weight of the characters' choices to resonate without the need for words. The cinematography is equally impressive, capturing both the intimate moments and the grandiosity of the superhero spectacle.

""Avengers: Endgame"" is not without its flaws, but they pale in comparison to the sheer audacity of its ambition and the emotional resonance it achieves. The time-travel element, a risky narrative choice, is handled with surprising coherence, providing a framework for revisiting key moments in MCU history. The film also manages to inject humor without undermining the gravity of its themes, striking a delicate balance that has become a trademark of the MCU.

In the end, Avengers: Endgame is a celebration of the power of storytelling and the enduring appeal of heroes. It's a film that transcends its genre, leaving an indelible impact on popular culture. As the culmination of a cinematic journey that began with Iron Man in 2008, Endgame not only delivers a satisfying conclusion but cements the MCU as a cultural phenomenon that has redefined the possibilities of blockbuster filmmaking. It's a fitting tribute to the characters, the creators, and the fans who have made this unprecedented cinematic universe a shared and cherished experience.",10

This was the perfect end to the most important franchise in my life. It was absolutely wonderful in every way, beautifully written and paced, and I can't imagine that there was any possible way, of 14 million, to end this better than it did.

I got home and just had no idea what to do. So I thought about how much these stories mean to me, and how much the people in my life mean to me with them.

Extraordinary Endgame,28 April 2019,,10
How can they possibly save half of all living beings in the Universe?,5 July 2019,"How are the surviving Avengers & Co. possibly going to save half of the Universe that died? My wife & I had this discussion before viewing. It basically comes down to two options (assuming the events in ""Infinity War"" weren't just a dream): magic or time travel. All I'll say is: What they came up with was in ways reminiscent of the plot convolutions of ""Back to the Future II"" (1989).

""Endgame"" (2019) begins strong with the devastating reality of half of all living beings in the Universe suddenly vanishing. It starts to get lethargic about an hour in, but perks up with the three teams trying to apprehend the Infinity Stones so they can maybe reverse what happened at the end of the previous film.

Everything naturally leads to a huge battle in the last hour that I found boring, not to mention that the epilogue tended to drag on with too much of it being tedious. Still, there are lots of worthy bits throughout, like the opening, the unpredictable first encounter with Thanos, Thor getting flabby, the moving match between Black Widow and Hawkeye at the cliff's edge, and much more.

Unfortunately, the myriad protagonists work against the film because it can't concentrate on any one or two characters for very long. Captain Marvel is short shifted and decidedly dull. Plus the movie's overlong at 3 hours, 1 minute.

Conclusion of long Running Saga,27 April 2019,"Unbelievable. 21 films culminating in the conclusion of endgame. The scope is incredible, I will only say it's definitely one of the best Marvel films out there, and there are many.

I laughed , cried and was speechless. 3 hours well used. It was a perfect ""ending"" of the Avenger Movies. I will watch it again and again and again. Love it more than 3000.It leaves you at the edge of your seat and the 3rd act is just insane and a masterpiece. Infinity War was fantastic but this is insanity, in all the right ways. The best series finale that I hoped it would be and then some.

Amazing story, the acting is outstanding, epic action, great CGI, the best storytelling ever told in a superhero movie, amazing performance. I love it more than 3000.Happiness, sadness, pure joy, excitement... I'm gonna miss this moment in my whole life because let's face it- it's been awhile movies can bring such a big enthusiasm like this. It's an experience that You'll remember forever.

There are times when people were clapping, laughing & crying at the same time. There's also one scene where whole theatre was kept silent because they are so much engaged with the movie. You know that it's a superhero movie and in the end superheroes will win but, how they portray the whole story left everyone in the hall speechless.

The truth is that movie was too long, last hour or at least half hour of the movie was a waste of time, its sci fi, not documentary movie, we dont need to see how they live happy ever after, also despite good fulfillment, you have to say that scenario is what, time machine scenario is the easiest one to extract more money, but the movie leaves the feeling that it is not the true ending.

SPOILER ALERT! Questions After the Movie,26 April 2019,,9
"Where to begin, where to begin!",2 July 2024,"You know a movie is outstanding when the end credits alone are more epic than the majority of films released in the last 20 years! This film is the pure definition of an emotional roller coaster and throughout its run time brings about fascination, humor, sadness, incredible excitement, and sheer finality. This is not your typical superhero movie and some viewers used to the entertaining, nonstop action style of the previous films may be disappointed, but I think that this movie brilliantly satisfies and subverts expectations.

The film's storytelling is some of the best seen in blockbuster filmmaking, combining smart writing, intimate character moments, and exceptional world-building to create one of the best blockbuster stories ever. The superheroes are all brilliantly acted and well written, with Robert Downey Jr, Scarlett Johannson, and Chris Evans, in particular, turning in some of the most human and enduring acting performances I have ever seen. In addition, Josh Brolin once again proves utterly breathtaking as Thanos, and he somehow feels even more intimidating and insane than he was in Infinity War. This further proves that Thanos is definitely among the very best movie villains of the last century.

The action is honestly some of the finest in the history of cinema. This film's world-renowned final battle is riveting, heartbreaking, awe-inspiring, and exceptionally well choreographed. Never before have I been so thoroughly moved and elated while watching a battle scene in a film. The film's soundtrack is also one of the best of its kind and brilliantly complements the action. It is filled with some of the most stunning, blood-pumping, and epic music themes you will EVER hear.

And while the time travel elements (as with all time travel movies) is certainly questionable, as long as you don't spend a week thinking about them they most likely will not bother you. This is my favorite movie of all time (yes I do watch other movies too) and I don't think anything will ever top the experience of watching this movie on opening night in the theatre. However, even upon second viewings, the film remains an utter blast to watch with tons of replay value due to the many easter eggs to previous films. Smart, beautiful, epic, and timeless this is a superhero masterpiece!",10

An epic ending for a great saga,25 April 2019,"So where to start?

After 11 years of watching all MCU movies repeatedly (like countless times, you can ask my friends about it, talk about INFINITY watch 😅). I am more than happy that the Marvel Studios together with the Russo brothers and all of their crews brought this movie to life. How can you even fit all the stories together in just 3 hours of runtime? T'was a genius way of culminating NOT ONLY the phase 3 movies but even from phase 1.

DON'T EXPECT TO UNDERSTAND EVERY PIECE OF THE STORY/MOVIE WITHOUT WATCHING THE LAST ONES!

SPOILER ALERT!! - Full of Plot holes and a huge set back from Infinity War,1 August 2019,,6
Thank You Russo Brothers!!! (Spoiler Free),2 May 2019,"""Avengers: Endgame"" did the un-thinkable, it was a thrilling conclusion to 2018's ""Avengers: Infinity War"", and concluded the character arches to Marvel favorites, Iron Man, Captain America, and Black Widow. The M.C.U (Marvel Cinematic Universe) started in 2008 with Robert Downey Jr. starting in the title role of ""Iron Man"" and 22 films later and over a decade of time has changed both Hollywood and audience's expectations forever. The film directed by Joe and Anthony Russo tells an exciting and emotional story that also gives Marvel fans exactly what they would want with multiple fanboy/girl moments and Easter eggs throughout. The film works on so many levels, but the highlight is the emotional impact the concluding arches of these characters. With so many films for fans to get-to-know, and understand these characters, it almost feels like watching one's best friend or family member go through the on-screen drama that unfolds. This may not be the end of the M.C.U., but it is the end of a very special era for comic book and movie fans.",10

Overrated,26 April 2019,"Started slow. Ignored some of the Marvel hero lore. Made some characters too strong and others too weak; this was incongruent with previous movies.

A perfect end,25 April 2019,,10
Does not live up to the hype,26 April 2019,"Before you start tearing your eyes out because you think this film was a masterpiece, I can assure you that it most certainly was not. Was it fun to watch? Absolutely. It was fun and funny but the film is riddled with plot holes and attempts to alter its entire arc to accommodate a wider universe that apparently relies on Captain Marvel which makes no sense. The film felt very lazy when it came to the interweaving of ten years of previous films and ultimately falls flat on its face. Perhaps the films after this will fix the mistakes but calling it the end of the infinity saga leads us to believe it is the beginning of an entirely new timeline saga since the timeline we knew is now long gone. Yes, despite cap returning the stones, the timeline we originally loved is now the past and this new five year ahead timeline is the world they want us to live in. No thanks. You'll need to earn my trust back.",6

Heart over quality,26 April 2019,"Avengers Endgame from a technical standpoint is a downgrade from the previous Infinity War. But what it lacks in technicality and overall quality it more or less make it up with emotions, stakes and an abundance of fanservice.

The pacing is fairly inconsistent, storytelling botched and action sequences minimal. Rather the Russo brothers put emphasis on character development over plot, which were basically more or less presented in the last movie. And the characters were mostly handled pretty well except for one character, which I wont spoil.

Endgame is less of a movie, more of a love letter to the fans that stayed with the MCU ever since Tony Stark built a suit in a cave. It's the Russo brothers way of letting you know that they heard us and they want to satisfy what we want to see, and they did just that and even more.

I do have few gripes with few parts of the movie but the pay off in the end is insurmountable. A near perfect, nay perfect conclusion to the Infinity Gauntlet storyline which will have you come back here time after time only to watch the third act one more time. Movies hardly pay off as good as this.",8

The movie opens with a subtle reference to infinity to spark ur memory of what happened at the end. The end made all 22 movies worth the watch and sets up the future of the Marvel Cinematic Universe perfectly. You will happy, excited, and sad throughout the film.

There's a little pandering towards an all female avengers film but it doesn't hurt the film in general. So why 7? I didn't like the treatment they gave to Thor. I think that was lazy writing.,7
The best possible ending,25 April 2019,,10
Meh?,26 April 2019,,7
Waste and junk,7 May 2019,Worst film of all time in the whole film industry.the most over hyped film ever in the world.absolutely disastrous and useless movie.,1
An Amazing Movie (if you are familiar with the universe),6 May 2019,"This movie gets nine and a half stars for anyone seeing all the mainstream Marvel films. It ties everything together so wonderfully. Such clever writing. Only a couple of small problems, clunkers added by Disney to sell their woke version of political correctness, but on every other level, extremely well done.",9
What a movie,25 April 2019,"What a movie, Feels like an epic, once a lifetime!",10
Wrapped up all of marvel movies with a bow,22 July 2019,,8
Its good,16 March 2020,"Nope... i will say it's good, worth to watch. i dont care about the bad review because it's their feeling, but in my opinion this movie is good.

at the final part, oh..its hard to explain my felling. But the important things is this movie is soooooo good",10
A half disappointing movie....Ps: in the end where was LOKI???????,26 April 2019,,8
Mind Blowing Finale,24 April 2019,"From a surprise starting ten minutes to great character development through to the best action with heart stopping events, this movie is amazing!! So many cheer worthy surprises & welcome developments,both the casual or diehard fan will be very happy.",9
Honestly was disappointed,27 October 2021,"Hear me out i think that there aren't any acting flaws, there are great moments, great action and it finished alot of character arks but the whole time travel premise feels stiff and it's hard to sit down and watch a three hour film that is so slow to start, overall fine but not as great as infinity war.",7
Top 5 MCU Movie,26 April 2019,"Amazing (almost) end game fit the infinity phase of Avengers Movies. Several scenes brought mass applause and cheering throughout the movie. Love, love, loved the commitment to the MCU characters who started it all. I'm saying top 5 but my 12 year old son is giving it top 3 status. Will be adding to the box office gross to see this one in theaters again 👍💵😍",10
Poorly explained time traveling concepts,15 July 2019,,6
Monumentally disappointing. Also Joe Russo gets cast as the gay extra in his own movie.,9 August 2019,,1
Unhappy ending,27 April 2019,,8
A magnificent conclusion,28 April 2019,"Truly a breathtaking end to a saga that is so dear to all of us

With an ending that shakes my world You will not be disappointed with this conclusion

This is truly one of the best marvel has ever made",10
Best comic move,27 April 2019,Marvell had a challenge to finish a great 11-year stage and 22 films that had a great viewing experience may have some small mistakes. I expected more than some characters. But I'm happy at this end I do not expect it could have been better deserves 10/10 because it was a big challenge and has won the challenge It should not be compared with less effortless films Do not direct this great challenge and should not be compared with the infinity war because this film is a complement to the film The Infinite War,10
The best watch for this year,27 April 2019,Go watch it won't reveal much. It's very well done.,9
A 10 year-long journey at its end,16 May 2022,"It started back in 2008 with Ironman. And about 20 movies after that, phase 3 of the MCU ends with Endgame. And what an end it is! Goosebumps everytime I see the portals scene. Thank you!

Haters take a chill-pill and try not to choke on it...",10
I didn't think it could get this good...,25 April 2019,"After watching Infinity War, the bar was set super high. I was scared that Endgame couldn't reach the same level, but it went even higher. Love it times 3000.",10
"If not for Captain Marvel, this would have been 9.5/10",26 April 2019,"As the title states. The climax of this film is the most important part. Something the whole previous 2 and a half hours builds up to. To have it spoiled by an all powerful character, who can just swoop in and destroy whole spaceships, takes away all the suspense and hence, in my opinion, all the fun.

There is a reason even superheroes are flawed. Even they struggle and fail. It's to allow us to identify with them.

I loved Infinity War, but this I will not see again.",7
Spolier: Great Movie; but not enough Captain Marvel,27 April 2019,,8
After 2 days I've changed my rating from an 8 to a 6,5 May 2019,,6
I see only - Loose ends,27 April 2019,"The film was ok, but i don't see Marvel in it. I see frustrations, unanswered questions, heroes ""unavailable"" and heroes ""unused"". I enjoyed it, but i went in with too many expectations. And in the end i can only say: ""Plot holes ftw""",1
THIS IS SUCH A GREAT FILM,17 May 2019,"So i've already watched this film at cinema. yeah actully in first day , but the tickets sold out and i came in second day . soo i was cry .not cry bad ,but in my heart this film is touching u know , u knew bout the war ,and things , and this is the end of avengers . thank u :)",10
Outstanding,25 April 2019,"Avengers: Endgame is hands down one of the best or probably the best movie of the year. Even though it's basically a part two of Avengers: Infinity War, it seems like a completely different movie right from the start. The movie has some amazing performances from the likes of Robert Downey Jr, Chris Evans and many more. I hope to see Endgame winning awards at next years Oscars. This film was the best possible way to wrap up such an amazing franchise. Thank you Marvel.",10
Excellent,26 April 2019,,10
An Epic experience for all Marvel Fans!,26 April 2019,"When Infinity War ended... I was desperate to find out what happens next. After a long year of waiting, Endgame is finally out for the whole world to experience. I can honestly say from start to finish it was a fantastic thrill ride, you could tell the whole cinema audience was Morphed into the Marvel Universe from the get go.

I would highly recommend watching this film while it is out in cinema.. Why you still reading this.. go and book a ticket, enjoy!",9
A million times yes!,13 September 2019,"Wow, this film is a superb culmination of every single Avengers film. You possibly could've seen more of Captain Marvel but seeing as she's a late edition it didn't seem that out of place.

I was amazed with the preemptive thought that went into this final edition. Every scene that passed, I had to take a breath, everything seemed to gel effortlessly, although at the same time seemed complicated. The film is a masterclass and I'm gutted, but as they say, all good things come to an end......",9
Absolute Satisfaction,26 April 2019,,10
An Average Marvel Movie,11 May 2019,,6
Good movie,4 May 2019,"Just watched this in cinema today and i'm not disappointed. First few minutes were slow, but it gets very intriguing after that. Most of the action scenes come towards the end of the movie and they were very good, but I wish it had more or lasted longer. I felt the story was good and made sense, but there's probably some cliches or plot holes that I don't know about lol. It's a good movie, not the greatest movie ever like some people say, that's The Shawshank Redemption for me, but it's still one of the best action movies and worth a watch.",8
One lime,26 April 2019,Some beautiful character moments that cut through right to the character's core and a fantastic ode to the past ten years. Just would have liked some nuanced action.,7
What an movie- i'm nearly speechless.,28 April 2019,"This movie is pure awesomeness. This is a movie, i will be remembered for eternity. Just a big thanks. Cinema was never so much entertaining. Can't wait for blu ray disk",2
I have never done this before...,6 May 2019,"A satisfying ending to a saga that has been going on for 11 years... not a cinematic masterpiece by any means, But fulfilled my comic book-nerdy needs. 9/10. It's good and you should see this movie. Dialogue: The writing isn't great but has it ever been in these films? (Ok Logan had a pretty good script) Acting: Maybe it's just me because I've asked 3 of my friends what they thought and they said the expected better... but I thought Downey was amazing in this CGI: Great Directing: a pretty Good job by the Russo Brothers",8
Epic. Emotional. Unforgettable.,6 May 2019,"""Saga of infinity"" was built 11 long years. 22 films. Everything was going to this event and it was cool. The film causes a huge number of emotions, but discarding them, we see a lot of plot flaws that leave behind too many questions. Is it good movie? Of course. Is it perfect? No. Is it worth seeing? Absolutely Yes.",9
Good Movie BUT.,26 April 2019,"I won't add any spoilers. It was a great marvel movie, but not one of my favorites. They had so much information to try and wrap into three hours, that they just left gapping plot holes. 2nd half of the movie rocked, but still massive plot holes.",8
One of the best endings of all time!,25 May 2019,"This movie was great. It was full of tragic moments, plot twists, new concepts and more. The ending was great, and I walked out of the movie theater greatly satisfied. It wrapped up the MCU in a great way, and will make all future films more memorable.

It was just great!!!",10
"Jumpin' Zeus, it's excellent!",24 April 2019,,10
Satisfying,21 March 2020,It was a fitting end to Marvel's 11 year plan. The only thing I had a problem with was the confusing time travel. I'm excited for the next phase of Marvel.,8
An Endgame designed for pre-teens,5 July 2020,"Never has so much been spent on glorious VFX to service an orgy of Deus Ex Machina in order to fulfill the standard juvenile Hollywood ending that the good guys always win. Such a pure, white bread, immature ending, I'm embarrassed for Marvel that so much effort went into an ending dumbed down for pre-teens. What's the point of all this comic-book-to-big-screen-madness if there's no doubt of the outcome?! I suppose they TRY to make it look difficult for the heroes but then you throw in never-done-before quantum-based time-travel and voila, good guys prevail. Such a colossal waste of story-telling, of sci-fi adventure. My soul weeps.",6
Excellent end tp a proper superhero movie series,26 May 2019,"Though the movie drags on a bit at the middle russo brothers have done an excellent job. Really, a nostalgic experience for all marvel fans.",9
Endgame Thank God,28 April 2019,"Think they've done the super hero thing to death and this one is no better or worse than any of the others, except it's a good 30 minutes too long. The CGI runs rampant as always, plot is ludicrous as they usually are with these things and if this truly is the final instalment it's come non too soon! A lot of young people love these kind of films of course and good luck to them, me, I'd prefer a good western!",6
I can't believe the humanity couldn't go on,2 May 2019,"First, half of ""universe"" died and the rest can't go on, all heroes was crying without a life sense. Can't believe that. A child on a bicycle angry ¿for what? He was too young to loose the faith. The humanity always rise after a war, even if they lost the war, Germany, URSS, Jews, Spain, Japan. Terrible film message.

Second, all the effort to bring out the Captain Marvel before the endgame and with the hope in her to solve the Thanos issue. For nothing, Captain Marvel do nothing... all expectations for nothing.

Action only until the end, the rest of the movie was boring.

Thank god Marvel is over, no need to know nothing about Marvel Universe. It was almost a bad addiction finally cure.",1
I was not even ready da,25 April 2019,Just go and watch this once in lifetime film.11 years of story telling come to a grand finale. You will not be disappointed. Except few super hero fans.you will not get happy ending always. Bet you. This movie will make you go crazy. Repeated audience is inevitable .,10

Amazing acting and beautiful scenes created. Very emotional and exciting at the same time. Gave me goosebumps",10
Incredible,27 April 2019,Simply brilliant! Super ending to a incredible franchise,10
Unfortunately...,29 April 2019,"Like much of other series , avengers gets worse with the end. Honestly, to my opinion not worth to go to cinema. Infinity wars was much better. I was expecting a great ending, not this.",6
They must have used infinity stones to make this!,27 April 2019,This is perfection. Never have I ever felt so many different immense feelings watching a movie. I am stunned. Best movie ever. Love it 3000. Thank you. Thank you for making this! THANK YOU!,10
Major plot holes,27 April 2019,,7
RDJ Disrespect heath ledger during oscar,1 May 2019,I hate to see iron man in this movie frankly because of his real life character.,1
Superhero movies at their very best!!,26 June 2020,"Avenger Endgame was a long awaited movie that really payed of waiting for these years. From the start of this wonderful franchise that had its ups and downs this movie really did a great job about ending this whole SAGA that last full 10 years across 23(i think) movies. That deserves an absolute 10.

But regarding Avengers as a movie i did have a couple of problems with it. Just to say that this is a well crafted movie and directors especially actors and stunt enseble team deserve much praise. Its 3 hour runtime can feel a bit because of its sad tone and character interactions in the first hour of the movie but i liked it because it fit for my taste because of the Infinity wars ending.

Second problem I had is with some of its comedy and scenes that were pointless like Hulk giving tacos etc. And the last problem i had is with that girl power scene it felt very cringy and it was absolutely unnecessary because they did that much better in Infinity war.

Everything else in the movie carried so much emotinal weight that made me impressed. I rarely see the movie that can gather so much people to watch and to make most of them leave the theaters heart broken. I can not compare this movie with other big superhero movies like Joker and The Dark Knight because they do seperate things.

This movie is 10 for me because of the ending that made me cry for these characters for the last time. If they screwed up the ending it would be 8.5.

Cant wait to see what MARVEL brings us in the upcoming SAGA!!",10
this is a awesome move,24 May 2019,,10
A review from Iraqi Cinemas,1 May 2019,,9
End.,6 May 2019,A true film geared towards fans made by fans this movie is good conclusion to many childhoods and a very amazing conclusion for 11 years of marvel truly spectacular.,9
"Culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant",24 April 2019,"What I was thinking all this time of how this movie will be, it completely amazed me because it was really beyond my thoughts and I'm sure for many of you guys,(but not all) of what you had been predicted, it has all the emotions in this movie. It has a lot of sadness from the beginning and it was very funny also, a very great action which was an epic one(very unique)and adventurous too.most importantly it has really gave a shock about it, not one time but several times and it has really touched my heart, prepare for it because there's lot of sorrows, pain, comedy, shocking moments and it was worth of crying a lot. When I was watching this, it gave a lots of goosebumps too most of the time and every part of the movie, very minute was special and precious.It deserves to have a rating on 10/10.When you'll finish to watch it you will want for the fifth one as it deserves to have an another one because I can't believe that it's the last one and it really have ended. The last thing that I want to say for those who has not yet seen the movie is prepare yourself, keep your eyes big open,(don't look down when you're eating or anywhere else and don't blink too much) hold your applause and most importantly keep your excitement in silence because there will be a lot of unimaginable moments of which you couldn't believe. Please enjoy the movie to the fullest of your life.For me it's the greatest film of all time and for me it has already shattered all records and I guess for many of you also.The graphics and quality was really awesome as it was a little more superior than the infinity war and the actions too was really glorious and incredibly done, was astonished to see that.There will be some moments where you will be like freezing and and trembling too.So thank you and once again for the epic word, ""Whatever it takes"".Glory to the Avengers and may it be the one and only that nobody can break its record.Thank you once again",9
END GAME ( Spoilers ),25 April 2019,,9
"A superhero ""war"" movie which feels more like a magical fairy tale. Not as good as the original Avengers.",10 May 2019,,6
A perfect ending to an unbelievable idea of this globe-wide mega-movie-series,26 April 2019,"With hopes and expectations reaching sky-high, the Russo-brothers directed movie doesn't let you down at any point of this mega-delight. Has a lot of moments for whistles and cheers, and also the ones to make you emotional. Goosebumps throughout the movie. Perfectly set in what could be confusing timelines(but the Russos managed it quite handsomely). Visual treat, actors were in their A-game, drama set on the highest of notes, larger than life visuals, background scores keep you totally invested, and the tried and tested formula of superhero humour is an icing on cake. Package of nostalgia and a step into phase 4 with goodbye to few of our favourite characters makes this one of best superhero movies made till date. After 11 years 21 movies, MARVEL STUDIOS still pulls of an extraordinary flick.",10

Whatever it takes !,11 July 2019,,8
Good way to end the game,27 April 2019,I thought this was the perfect way to end the game. This movie is the best of all the Marvel movies and is emotional and funny at the same time. It was a great ending to the era and a movie you won't regret seeing.,10
MCU FILM OF THE YEAR,25 April 2019,"The first two-thirds of the movie is very inventive. Swinging from bleak to It plays around with the narrative and the concept of time in this story. This slow burn, full of trademark MCU humor, is unpredictable and welcome.",10
Best of Marvel,25 April 2019,"The movie makes you laugh, cry, and walk out filling fulfilled. Watching every movie, going on the rollercoaster with them. One that every marvel fan should enjoy!!!!",10
Perfect transition!,6 May 2019,"I dont know what to say about the movie because if I consider it as the last movie, it might be a better end. however actually it is not an end it was a good opportunity for the desired changeover. and they did this very well. Russo's and Feige did not miss this great opportunity and got the chance to create a newer and more well-balanced cinematic universe. Thank you guys for everything. LOVE YOU",9

It was ok.....,27 April 2019,The movie was ok. I seen it yesterday. First 2.5 hrs is no action or fighting at all. The last 30 mins was a big fight. Captain marvel showed up in beginning of movie and the end. I def couldn't watch it again for 3 hrs,6
marvel surely you could do better,21 November 2020,"While the visual effects were incredible and the memes coming out of this movie were entertaining, I don't think marvel really put too much work into this ending.

Best movie ever,26 April 2019,,10
Movie for lifetime,26 April 2019,In just few words I want to give the review about film. As a diehard marvel fan you'll be really proud to be MCU fan. What an epic conclusion to the 22 films!

"Not the best, but fun.",27 October 2020,,6
Heavily expected still sarisfied,3 May 2019,"This is the first and foremost english movie which i've/we've watched the opening show in the morning at 5am. As it marks the end of the decade long marvel collection of movies, we were very much thrilled to watch the movie asap, but still we got tickets only on the next day. It was definitely one of the fascinating experience as the movie was filled with so many things like time travel, actions, emotions, suspense, it is definitely the most anticipated movie as everybody knows but the fact that it still manages to entertain is where the movie makers excel, hats off to pull off such a massive thing. But making my favourite Iron Man disappear in the end was unexpected and long lasting. In tamil Vijay Sethupathis' voice was just set into our sub conscious very well so it didn't set too much to the movie from the point of view of general audience like us.",9

Avengers ridiculing themselves...,11 August 2019,,1
Incredible is an understatement,25 April 2019,The movie starts of with immediate heartbreak. The movie is well paced and edited. MVC (MOST VALUABLE CHARACTER) is captain ameirca. He stole the movie and it was more of an captain America movie. The movie does a good service to the 6 Og Avengers and doesnt leave a moment where your crying laughing or aweing. Its amazing.,9

What did I watch ?,17 May 2019,,10
"Best, better, a mess, ok",20 September 2020,"Endgame was definitely better than infinity war. Luckily they did not make the mistake of staring all marvel heroes on every planet and in space (or at least not for the main part). This film was literally about cleaning up the huge mess infinity war left behind. Better, but far from the great first 2 parts of this series. A very slow pace, overly long, far fetched story full of plot holes. Some nice elements though like the ""back to the future"" part. And as expected there was the obligatory tear jerking part at the end.",6
Total Rubbish,7 June 2019,I watch probably 1 movie on an average every week from last 3 years and have watched a lot of boring movies but this is the first time I could not watch a movie to the end Can't be more boring movie then this,1
MASTERPIECE,24 November 2019,"This is the best movie ever made. If it isn't for the haters due to the success of this movie, it probably gonna be the top 3 on imdb",10
Whatever it takes...,25 April 2019,"Yeahhh....marvel took everything to make the movie they had promised, the most splendid comic flick I ,and to be honest anyone, has ever seen. First of all do not EVEN think about predicting the following events because from the first 15 mins of the movie you will be completely aware that it is not just another heros-win film.After that , the stoy line was very clear and away of confusion,no illogical-comical dialog or narration, wonderful acting ,and of course the most important one,the well done directing by Russo brothers.The mixture of all of these mad the movie so great that I as a Marvel hater really did enjoyed it.",9
"Nostalgia, epicness and melancholy",28 April 2019,,9
A Fitting Ending for the Dedicated Fan,26 April 2019,"What this studio has continued to do over the last decade is absolutely incredible. I can still remember the absolute thrill of sitting down in the theater and witnessing the creation of the MCU in the first Iron Man. Now, 11 years later, as a 19 year old, I can easily say that I experienced the same feelings I did all those years ago. I do not typically write reviews, but this movie deserves to be written about. It has moments where you laugh your ass off and it has moments where your heart is in your stomach. While I could write/complain about all of the things that I was upset about, or all of the things that caught me off guard, in the end the Russo Brothers made an absolute masterpiece that is there cherry on top of one of the greatest franchises of all time. I couldn't be happier with this film, and I couldn't be more excited to see what Marvel Studios has in store for hardcore fans such as myself.",10
Those few line of Tony Stark conversation with his dad Howard Stark is so powerful,3 May 2019,"Let me ask you a question. When your kid was born...were you nervous?
Wildly. Yeah.


-Did you feel qualified? Like you had any idea how to successfully operate that thing? -I literally pieced it together as I went along,I thought about what my Dad did, and...

-My old man, he never met a problem he couldn't solve with a belt. -I thought my Dad was tough on me.And now, looking back, I just remember the good stuff, you know. He did drop the odd pearl.

-""No amount of money ever bought a second of time.""

-Smart guy. -He did his best.

-Let me tell you. That kid's not even here yet and, there's nothing I wouldn't do for him.",9
Amazing conclusion,24 April 2019,"Endgame, the last movie in the Infinity saga. Set's up an amazing final showdown with the purple brute himself.

It also wraps up the story lines of multiple veteran characters very will. This movie aims to please. Every fan will be satisfied.",7
Perfect.,25 April 2019,"I had a lot of high expectations, a lot of anticipation, a lot of theories, and I was not let down at all. Yeah, there are some little nitpicks here/there, but honestly, not enough for me to not call it the perfect conclusion of the 21 movies leading up to it. Rest up, bring tissues, and wear a diaper (as Ruffalo instructed so you don't have to leave to pee, lol). Go watch and just enjoy. <3",9
"It was good, messy and something just dont make sense.",1 May 2019,"It was not a great movie, the previous movie was much better and I mean a lot. It could and should have been better but they tried to play it safe. I did enjoy the movie but when people talk about standing ovation I just roll my eyes. This is what worries me to much of this from fan boys that can see know wrong most watch without seeing.

Even though I did like this move some parts just bug me like the messy theories of time travel. Infact they made a mess of time travel theory and please dont tell me oh yeah its the Grandfather Paradox. The fact is so much was dependent on the past that if Thanos didnt do all those things as well as some of the others then much of the present would not be the same regardless of how you put it. The Guardians of the Galaxy would never had met Gamora so they would not know her etc",7
"Must compare to Infinity War, so no match..",2 May 2019,"If you expect to watch a movie that is almost as good as Infinity Game then you will be very disappointed... A film that should be at most 90 minutes length it has been pushed at 180 minutes and they felt that time with lot of non-sense talking without action

Didn't worth the money spent to watch the movie, not even the time.. Even if I was offered to watch it again for free, I would pass the offer without any hesitation..",3
"Wow, goosebumps and tears",5 May 2019,"Just brilliant, the cinematography, the sound, the costumes, a true marvel film at its best",10
The perfect way to end a saga,28 April 2019,"This film had everything! Action, comedy, stake, emotion, surprises and fan service.

The film didn't feel like 3 hours either

Hard to write much for this without giving anything away!

Fully worth a watch! For more impact, watch the others before hand or else you will be confused and there will be bits that won't land or will go over your head",10
Worth the Wait,25 April 2019,This is it. The final movie of phase 3 of MCU. I would just like to say - stay away from spoilers and watch this movie for yourself don't let some one spoil the movie for you .This movie is one hell of an emotional ride. That's all I have to say .,10

Just go and watch!!!,26 April 2019,"I'm not an old Marvel guy. My interest turned up last year only and that was so high that I went for Avengers Infinity War on the very first day of release. I loved the movie and the wait for the next installment started that day itself. Every Marvel Guy would agree that this wait was very long. But. But. But. The EndGame is 101% worth the wait. I'll not go very much into details because it is just a day old in the theatres here in India. The movie though was actually a bit comical in the beginning and towards the middle. Seriousness started to rise towards the end, with the last 30 or so minutes being the best, best, best part of the whole Marvel Cinematic Universe. People who have seen the movie might agree that some of the main characters were given less screentime. Not comparing to anyone but some appreciable characters had less screentime. But what matters more is how well they did their part in those minutes. In the end they all are heroes! One disappointment though was the lack of credit scenes. Every fan was expecting a glimpse of the next phase of the Superhero Universe. Nonetheless it is a great movie. A worthy one. Everyone should watch it once. *I have an opinion though. There were numerous fan theories about the movie. I think Marvel Studios should atleast make an animated series of the good ones.",10

"Satisfying and heartfelt, but not the world-beater some are hailing Endgame to be",29 April 2019,,7
"A little less conversation, a little more action...",5 May 2019,"I have to start of by saying that i'm not the biggest Avengers fan but i really enjoyed Infinity war. I saw the movie on the new Odeon Imax theather in Oslo and i was blown away in every aspect. Not only was the 3D effects better than I had ever seen, the movie it self was awsome. I could write on and on about all the obvious reasons to why Infinity war was great one but what hit me the most was the nice pace and tempo of the movie and besides the plot worked well. Compared to Endgame which in my opinion is a very slow movie. The Avengers kept on talking and talking on and on.. and then they plotted and then they talk some more about what they where plotting. I mean the action never came. For me what makes the avengers movies good is the pace of the movies and their ability to solve problems on the go. This one didn't have that it's to stationary, to slow to whiney. All of that though would be fine had the plot worked, but it didn't, it was to far fetched and it felt like it was rushed. They dug a hole they couldn't climbe out of. After two hours with no action i lost my patient and walked out of the theater. I'm not saying it was that bad but i just didn't feel it and i was left pretty much very dissatisfied.",1
Brilliant conclusion,3 May 2019,"This movie is almost great all around, with a great story and an ending to some characters that were just perfect. This movie definitely doesn't leave out any loose ends, but it does have a problem. The movie completely destroys the character development of some of its beloved characters i.e.Thor. They completely took away everything people liked about Thor, and made him look less like a god, and more... pathetic to say the least.",9
What a time to be alive,28 April 2019,"I could write a book about the emotional roller coaster I've been on this last decade. As a lifelong MCU fanatic, I can say I am beyond happy with how this journey started, progressed, and ended. Endgame was the perfect ending to this saga. As a 25 year old, I will probably never witness a cinematic adventure at such a scale ever again in my lifetime. All things considered, and without exaggeration, I can say this movie, after seeing all the MCU movies before it, is the greatest entertainment experience I have ever had.",10
This is it we are in the endgame,26 April 2019,This movie is total lit u will witness all kinds of human emotions possible even if u are a tough punk who feels he can't feel anything it is the finale of all 21 movies a story telling saga of greatness avoid spoilers it is the best movie there can ever be if you are not watching it i u are missing to be part of something really big at the end thank u avengers thank u marvel i have just no words to describe what I guys gaved and delivered worth it totally,10
AHHHH,17 May 2019,What more do I need to say??? It's freakin endgame and its a masterpiece,10
Amazing!,25 July 2019,"This movie can actually be named as ""best movie ever"". MCU has started 11 years ago, and every movie they did before, all this work was wasted for this incredible moment - finish a work they have been done. Every ppl have to watch it, cause anyone can just try, to describe that fantastic movie.",10
Final...(,19 January 2022,"I would like to discuss the movie ""Avengers 4: Finale"" (2019). The Avengers succeeded, but the sediment honestly remained. There is too much pessimism and despondency, the film is saturated. The feeling of hopelessness did not leave at all, even when something was going well. It can be seen that everything is difficult for the remaining avengers, every action, every step. There is no lightness, there are few jokes. I'm not talking about the final at all. Like a knife to the heart... the loss of two beloved characters... this is too much(

But as it is, the actors, as always, are on top. The special effects are super, there's nothing to talk about, the work of the operators is excellent! Everything is very spectacular, dynamic. It is worth noting that although the film is long, time flies by unnoticed. It certainly wasn't boring. Yes, and the film is not for once, to tell the truth, you can still watch a couple of times.

It's a pity that such a long and beloved story ended. I love these movies.",9

GREAT,26 April 2019,"I have seen Avengers Endgame on 24 April 2019 in Cinema. You like Avengers Infinity War, then you will like Avengers Endgame too. This Movie is same good how Avengers Infinity War. In Avengers Endgame we have got a big great battle too. All in one is Endgame a GREAT Avengers movie and a MUST watch movie (in cinema).",10
Not as good as Infinity War.,25 August 2019,,7
An Amazing Conclusion,17 March 2022,"Following the events of infinity war the avengers are all feeling the loss. They all have this sense of failure and are dealing with it in different ways but when a new possibility comes to life the avengers reassemble to try their hand again at stopping Thanos.

This movie did a really good job of making these characters feel human. The loss that they all suffered really shows their emotional sides and how each one of them deals with grief. This is one of the best parts of the film.

The storytelling can be a little wonky at times and there are quite a few plot holes but overall the story is great. They keep you intrigued by keeping this sense of urgency and this sense of last chance which is what keeps you interested. This movie is definitely paced as well as infinity war was, there are a fair amount of slow parts but a lot of it was needed.

The visuals in this movie are phenomenal and the people working in them need to be given props because this would have been a task to accomplish. The amount of things going on in these action scenes is insane so the that they were able to manage it so well was impressive. Much like endgame each character is given their moment and play a important role which is hard to do in a movie of this scale.

This is very much a conclusion to the last 10 years prior and they do a great job of rapping up certain storylines but also paving the way for future films. It puts you on a roller coaster of emotions and really shows how much these characters mean to the audience.

Overall I loved this movie and I think they rapped it up perfectly. The task they set out to accomplish was huge and they some how pulled it off. So, props to everyone involved and thank you for creating something that many of us never dreamed would happen.

9/10.",9
it could be far better than this,1 May 2019,This huge amounts of charecters made the main story something you lose yourself within it and dont know whats going on really in the infinity war they gave some logic to the idea of evil side of the story but again in this part they show it as something just want to destroy with its primitive ideas its realy unfair to compare this one time seen movie to batman. joker the movie one can see many times and still be enjoyed as you was seening it for the first time,7

AN ALMOST PERFECT ENDING,28 April 2019,,8
Sina' review on Avengers:Endgame,17 December 2021,"In addition to poor scenario, the film has a terrible comedy. The film is unnecessarily too long without having much to say.

I have no idea why Hollywood has such a loose comedy. It's nothing more silly face mimics.

The cinematography and video effects are eye-catching but I'm not impressed since we are in this era.",7
ENDGAME > ROLLERCOASTER,27 April 2019,Look it is the best movie I've ever saw in my life. Plz watch only in theatres.,10
Not what I expected.,27 April 2019,"I'd like to start with I'm a great marvel fan and loved infinity war must have watched it about 20 times. Waiting all year for this film was hard and the excitement as I got ready to watch endgame was crazy. As a whole the story was good and we'll set out, but a few things did disappoint me. I'll start with hulk I thought they made is character weak and just not like the hulk we use to, hulk was suppose to be like a wild animal with no control yet in this film he's like the hulk out of a kids cartoon. Thor he played an amazing part in infinity was and at the start of this film he was still the Thor we like, but they turned him into an idiot, I get they wanted us to see all the characters giving up but they made him a joke, I get the film's are not 100% serious but they just destroyed him. There are some very good parts to the film that made me laugh and want to cry but I just don't feel they pulled it off as good as infinity war. Infinity war was amazing one of the best in my eyes and I was really hoping this film would be the same, maybe I need to watch it a few more times to appreciate it more I don't know.",6
trash,21 July 2019,"So so disappointing... I am speechless, boring, stupid... All i was doing is watching how much is left till the end of the movie...",1
How It's possible,30 April 2019,,10
good... but it was no infinity war,24 April 2019,"Endgame was written to be the epic conclusion of 20-plus marvel movies. It is a good conclusion but not an 'epic' one. Every character is given a good arch and heartfelt moments. The movie just lacks the magic of Infinity War. There are very few fight scenes until the big fight at the end, and I just found myself getting impatient, waiting for something to happen. The plot was jumping around a lot and sometimes things just seemed to happen so quickly, which is weird when many scenes seemed to drag on. Nebula contributed heavily to the plot, but I don't think it made enough sense, and it also makes Nebula the most annoying character, as she already gave away the soul stones location in Infinity War. Everything about Hulk felt off, and Captain Marvel just didn't fit in. To be fair, there are some amazing moments in the final act, and I finally got the action I was craving. But by then, I had somewhat disconnected for the movie. What I loved about Infinity War is it starts with amazing momentum and never stops. Endgame took just a little too long to establish itself. Even once the Avengers start executing their plan, there is very little action or epic moments. I also think Thanos was underplayed in the movie, as were the use of the infinity stones or any superhero powers. The heroes definitely could've played around more with their settings as well. Maybe it will be better when watched in conjunction with Infinity War, and maybe I'm a little too much of a Thanos fan. All in all, it's a good watch but the movie failed to make me feel the emotions I felt from Infinity War.",9
Avengers - cult movie,19 January 2022,"The Avengers is a cult movie series where we can watch all our childhood heroes in cool costumes and a great cast. The picture looks as bright as possible and because of this you can not take your eyes off the picture.

I love the humor in this series of films. Tony Stark is my favorite character to watch all the time. The plot is very unusual and it is quite difficult to guess the ending. I also want to note the elements of combat in this picture - as usual with the Avengers - this is the highest level. Watch with pleasure.",9
My favourite,19 January 2022,,10
The perfect superhero film,25 April 2019,Everything you wished for and lots more. If you thought the stakes were high with Infinity war then be prepared to blown away by the newest installment in the MCU.,10
A Perfect Conclusion,26 April 2019,"No matter how it turned out, I would have nothing but respect for what the filmmakers behind the MCU managed to pull off in just over a decade. A slate of 21 movies sharing characters, themes and story-lines - connected by a joint goal to get the audience and the characters to one harmonious conclusion. After 2018, in which we got one of the MCU's finest films in Black Panther, and surely their most ambitious (at that time) in Avengers: Infinity War, the pressure for Avengers: Endgame to deliver on a decade of build-up and potential seemed like an impossible task.

I can't help but think of what happened with Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy. We started with a terrific punch of fresh air in Batman Begins. Then Nolan made what is considered by many to be the best superhero film ever made in The Dark Knight (it's not my personal favorite, but I do love it). TDK became one the most successful and highly-praised films of all time. Then the pressure - how could the third film in that trilogy possibly live up? The answer: it didn't. The Dark Knight Rises was a thoroughly entertaining, well-acted movie. But it was riddled with plot-holes and conveniences that contributed to a film that simply could not help but feel disappointing compared to what came before it.

I say all that to say this: Avengers: Endgame lives up not only to its terrific predecessors from last year, but also the entire 21-film run that came before it. It serves as both a conclusion to and celebration of all the films that led up to it. It delivers on every single expectation (at least from this fan) and then exceeds them. It is as epic a film as the industry makes in this time, and there isn't a minute of the three hour run time I would shave. So many of the little easter eggs and sly moments from the past decade of these movies are called back in brilliant and inventive ways, while at the same time delivering something completely new.

While I liked Infinity War, my biggest complaint was that the film's editing felt jarring. It had the task of juggling many story-lines (and I respect the monumental effort), but it seemed like it just shuffled between them too quickly - rarely giving us time to mourn for lost characters or fully soak in important events. Endgame completely fixes this issue. This is a master class in film editing and if the Oscars ignore it in that category come awards season, it will truly be a blemish on their continually tarnishing record. It does take its time, but in the best way possible. When characters face dark or emotional circumstances, we truly feel them. These are characters we, the audience, have bonded with for over a decade. And all of that emotional connection pays off perfectly.

Another great highlight is that many characters who fans feel have been kinda left out the last few films get big and important story-lines in this film, finally moving from supporting players to huge plot-shifters. It's great to see so many great characters finally living up to their full potential.

Everything else works. There's a reasonable amount of humor to balance out the heavy drama. Every actor delivers some of their finest (if not their best) work in this series. The special effects are phenomenal. Character design, production design, and cinematography continue to hold up the high standards set by other great films in this franchise.

I really don't know how Kevin Feige, the Russo brothers, and their talented team of filmmakers and actors pulled this thing off. It's quite a feat. I go see a lot of movies in the theater as its my preferred viewing venue, and this is easily one of the most enjoyable movie-going experiences I've ever had. Avengers: Endgame begs to be seen in the theater. This is the masterpiece we were all hoping for. Kudos to everyone involved. 10/10.",10
"Ambitious, bittersweet and spectacular, yet flawed",26 April 2019,"""Avengers: Endgame"" is an ambitious cinematic extravaganza and a bittersweet culmination to an 11-year journey, yet it overwhelms so much in the final act that the audiences fail to detect its flaws. The more you think about what happened, the more you find problems.

As I clapped, cheered and teared up with the audiences, I understood how the Marvel Cinematic Universe became a mega-franchise that continued to create fervent fans through the power and charm of its heroes. This has the best final act in a superhero film. I got chills all over my body and my jaw just dropped in awe in the spellbinding moments, especially in the final action sequences. This is like the ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2"" and ""Lord of the Rings: Return of the King"" of the MCU: a film as epic as the saga it concludes. Not a single cast member wasted this opportunity by giving an awkward performance. Everyone seemed so into it and recognized the pressure of their character to get that single win over fourteen million possible losses. Most of the humor is also brilliantly-placed compared to other MCU offerings that could not crack a joke well.

In its three-hour running time, the film traverses through a very complicated plot, more complicated than its predecessor. As opposed to the relentlessly brash, unending clash in ""Infinity War,"" ""Endgame"" slows down and takes its time to explore grief and the effects of the previous tragic events to the characters. The plan of the Avengers unfolds detail by detail, from practice runs to jokes. Some of the stretched first act can be cut off such as the one-liners and unnecessary character interactions.

The film's second act struggled to transition from one mission to another-from one tone to another-which undermined the progression of how a particular mission will conclude. In this ""Back to the Future"" second act, I was ready to deem the film as mediocre and overlong. But once the final battles ensued, the drawn-out build-up truly paid off with action scenes that reminded me of the power of films to create an experience of epic proportions. This is what film as a medium can do, and boy, is it amazing! Terrific action choreography and visual effects in the third act really elevated this film beyond its serviceable middle section.

""Endgame"" did give satisfying endings for some of its beloved characters. However, as nitpicky as it may sound, directors Joe and Anthony Russo are too much invested in devising an emotional full stop on a character's story instead of creating a cinematically-cohesive science fiction narrative. A character's story ends satisfyingly even if how it happens didn't really make any sense.

This not how Time Travel works, well if we will consider other popular culture works that explored it. There are a bunch of what can be considered as ""plot holes"" (you can find them online) in its time travel story and character conclusions, most of which is felt when the audience says ""what?"" or ""why is he/she there?"" out of confusion watching a scene. I have read a couple of articles that explained these ""plot holes,"" and none of them really resolved them entirely since the explanations are mostly theorizing based on what was just briefly mentioned in the film. Fans can do all their theorizing, but these ""plot holes"" are problems in the film's depiction of events and ideas.

Nevertheless, with all its flaws, this is a very strong film due to its sense of awe and ambitious story. Even if I didn't love it 3000, the shock and awe tactic of the Russo brothers still worked.

P.S. Captain Marvel was so under-utilized in this film. I was waiting for her the entire time.",6
Greatest movie I've ever seen!,26 April 2019,"The story was action packed, emotional, and full of great laughs that was perfectly balanced. When a movie can get the whole theater to be laughing, gasping, cheering, and crying out loud, to me you have made a great movie. Would/will watch again!",10
I'm reeling,27 April 2019,"If I hadn't grown up in the silver age of Marvel, if I hadn't worshipped the stories Stan wrote and the pictures Jack drew, if these iconic characters hadn't been modernised for a new generation with shorter attention spans and a need for 'comic' interludes, I'd have scored this higher. It's good. But I hate the lame humour and the modern take. Having said that, I enjoyed the film.",7

I'm in the midst of rewatching the MCU and one thing I will say is this: Robert Downey Jr. Is a gem. At this point he could've really phoned it in and few of us would've noticed or cared but he gives everything he's got in this performance. He's the best actor in the MCU.",9

Marvel (in general),31 May 2019,"I want to get this out that I don't think marvel is overrated. Although I'm not a huge fan of the whole universe, I can understand why many are. I really like a great deal of the movies, my favourites is probably guardians 1 and 2 I'm very happy that this is a financial success, it's always fun to see marvel out do themselves at the box office, and this film is nearly the highest grossing movie of all time. Critically however I find this movie overrated, Unlike infinity war this film meanders a lot. Many of the jokes don't land and some of the scenes are down right stupid. I though the last action scene was great and the dialogue like usual is fun If you think this is the best movie ever I don't want to change your opinion, personally I cannot understand this being 0.5 ratings below the Godfather",6
Like a thanksgiving,27 April 2019,"Avengers end game was like a thanks giving turkey, the movie statisfy all of the movie fans like what kind of thing will people see and enjoy those elements were present in this movie in a tremendous manner.

I like most is this has lots of other things than the fight sequence, when putting all the super heroes one place most probably there will always we lots of fights sequences but in this movie we have everything that's the special",9
Not the best avengers movie.,15 September 2019,"Ok so to start this is not a bad movie. However it's not the best of the avengers franchise. Only way I can explain it is there seems to be a lot going on without anything really happening.

The whole time travel thing makes no sense at all. Although they do try to explain it during the movie all I can say if the way they describe time travel to work is true then half the cast wouldn't exist.....

Hulk was better before he became the weird half human half green beast thing.... Thor drunk all the time not cool.

Think ideas for what to do with everyone ran a bit thin towards the end.

However there is some funny moments. Some good battles and obviously most of the characters are generally awesome.

Don't let anything I say put you off but don't expect it to be a good as previous movies.",6
I don't get the high rating,17 March 2021,"I really don't understand how people think this film is amazing. I see the absolute bias when it comes to rating nowadays and the worst part is all these fan boys will be following the Russo brothers and rating their terrible films 10/10 each time.

This movie makes Infinity War look good ... and that was an absolute mess of a film too. I can't wait to see what kind of complete waste they will come up with next ......",1
Masterpiece,27 April 2019,"Growing up on the MCU films has given me a connection to these characters that makes this movie amazing.

Complicated yet satisfactory,5 May 2022,"Avengers: Endgame is complicated, yet satisfactory. It has issues, but hits key goals. First, Endgame explores the aftermath of Infinity War, solidifying its impact and earning the ensuing redemption. Next, the time heist is convenient, but effectively reflects on the franchise and develops core characters. Lastly, the finale is excessive, but that's what the masses want. Plus, its prelude fight between Thanos and the three core Avengers is exciting. Power levels are inconsistent, the climax gets desensitizing, and the plot is clunky, but Endgame finishes with emotional closure. Because drama is strategically emphasized, Endgame ultimately overcomes its flaws.

Technically, Endgame isn't as cohesive as Infinity War, but still succeeds. Visually, there are extended shots, overheads, and conscious composition. The editing is cumbersome, but manages a massive scope. The sound isn't as symbolic and the music isn't as restrained, but both still contribute. Meanwhile, the production design of the finale is noticeably colorless. This was likely an attempt at a gritty atmosphere, but it's mostly just unsightly. However, the effects are extensive (though CGI heavy) and the cast is amazing. Plus, the acting is touching. Overall, it's a downgrade from Infinity War, but Endgame still offers plenty.

It's over!,25 April 2019,"That was the greatest ending that was made for that world which started 11 years ago by making it so great and powerful

After losing by Thanos in Infinity war the whole team is starting to get them selfes ready by getting Captain Marvel to their team to defeat him and get every body disappeared again so what will they do ? Every body wanted to know what was going to happen after the ending of infity war Actually they made it great really great with powerful story that got every small and big thing from marvel universe with 3 hours ! That's unbelievable to get to know it ,it got every character that created the universe by a great way to end the game by it's suitable way

By the performances everybody did a great job that did what they supposed to do in every scene was created I can say that the best acting in the movie was done by Robert Downy Jr

The Visual effects were great with no any negative point in it,the sound system was good and I felt it in the theater,every simple thing that was supposed to be good was there and thanks to the Russos for getting every thing really great

The movie you should see it go see it as hard as you can if you're a great fan to marvel and if your not you can also go and believe me you're gonna see every thing can be made in any movie there gonna be action,comedy, great scenario I hope he get a chance by nominating it in the adapted screenplay next Oscars as Logan did,great acting,real drama,so many claps you will do if you're communicating will with watching the movie What you see about the movie with no spoiling if you saw it",9
Endgame closes off a decade of storytelling in suitably epic fashion,29 April 2019,"Avengers: Endgame, the culmination of eleven years of storytelling spanning twenty-two movies, represents a very peculiar time in the history of film. It is at once an incredibly ambitious project and the product of twenty-two mostly reasonable, inoffensive films made to appeal to the broadest audience possible. It is a celebration of something I'm not sure should be celebrated, the concentration of the box office and blockbuster culture at the expense of artistry, done so by an aggressive corporation that conquers more and more of Hollywood's creative landscape each day.

And it's absolutely magnificent.

Endgame is the sequel to last year's Infinity War, an average movie elevated by a truly shocking ending. For the first time, we went into our twice-a-year dose of Marvel movie expecting the expected victory and were greeted with bitter defeat. Our heroes had been tossed aside, their ideals shattered and in many cases lives ended, all to give this purple raisin man a happy ending complete with a farm and an infuriating little grin. It was incredible because it was unexpected, and unexpected not because it wasn't a possibility, but within the Marvel Cinematic Universe the concept of the unexpected seemed as foreign to their writers as original storytelling.

To say I dislike the Marvel Cinematic Universe would be an overstatement. I have seen all twenty-two of its installments, and while liking only a few of them, there have been fewer still that I've actively disliked. For the most part, they've been perfectly reasonable ways to spend a couple hours on a Saturday afternoon, undercut by low stakes and the inevitable joke that follows every dramatic moment.

But although Endgame is a part of this franchise, its storytelling feels decidedly different. Where the MCU is comical, Endgame is dramatic. Where the MCU is superficial, Endgame is expansive and thorough. Where the MCU is formulaic, Endgame is unpredictable. Where the MCU is cynical, Endgame is emotional. And where the MCU is always building to a conclusion that it seems will never come, Endgame is that conclusion. Of course, this isn't to say it doesn't retain some elements of what's made the MCU so popular. The humour and characterization are there, though a little less fleshed out than in previous installments.

This relative lack of characterization and humour makes sense given the context of the film. We've already seen twenty other films, which served not only the purpose of building to where we are now but familiarizing us with the characters that populate this story. Understanding it felt rewarding, as if I'd studied for the last ten years and proceeded to do well on the exam, a feeling I'm hardly familiar with. And what characterization there is is generally well thought out, even if the dialogue lacks the snappiness of Whedon's takes on the franchise.

But what the film does have is power. Emotional moments take center stage, with more a scene than not delivering a tear-inducing moment, doubtlessly rendering the invested viewer an emotional wreck by the time the credits roll. The Russos very clearly understand that they're delivering the final adventure - at least of this particular saga - and imbue their film with powerful nostalgia enhanced by melancholy and exhilaration in equal measure.

This isn't to say Endgame is a masterpiece. The story's logic often threatens to cave down on itself and the film as a whole is somewhat short on action. Thor's arc isn't handled nearly as gracefully as the others, which is a shame because he became one of the more interesting Avengers after Ragnarok and arguably the most after Infinity War. The pacing of individual scenes occasionally feels unnecessarily drawn out, usually to service a limp punch-line that reduces whatever emotion the respective scene was striving towards. The second act feels underdeveloped compared to the first and the third, offering an interesting concept while failing to exploit its thematic potential. But there are moments when all the pieces come together, delivering something it seems only this film can, a soaring, kinetic, exhilarating joy that had my audience applauding and me wanting to. And it's moments like these when Endgame is untouchable.

How the hell they follow this up is a question for a new era of actors, storytellers, and the corporation that towers over them all. But I'm going to bet that they don't.

As for me, I think I'm finished with superhero movies. That being said, they've been putting smiles on my face and tears in my eyes for almost my entire life, and for that I'm grateful.",8
AMAZING WAY TO BOW OUT,28 April 2019,"Although this film way not be the all out action that some may want or expect it is so much more than that, so many story lines are finished, set up to be continued and others are just starting... Marvel really have done this franchise and themselves huge justice! The payout from this film is so worth it and if you don't shed a tear at any point of this film then you simple aren't human, raw emotion. MUST WATCH if you are even a casual marvel/avengers fan!",9
Part of the journey is the end.,25 April 2019,"Avengers: Endgame is simply the best movie ever created in the entire cinematic history. Best. If there is any word stronger than that, I would have no hesitation in using it. Everything about it can only be rivalled by very few movies. People will be talking about this movie tomorrow, the day after, next month, next year, in 10 years, in 100 years as the best thing humankind has ever made. We have made history here today and we will not stop until we are satisfied.",10

Very good ending BUT . . .,4 May 2019,"The first 2 hours of the movie were pretty boring. Great last hour but, boy, was I ready to get to the final hour. Did love last scene with Cap America. Won't say anything more. CA:WS and first Avengers were my faves. This ranks probably #3 or #4 of the Marvel movies. Plus sweet cameo by Stan Lee. Would have been funnier if he had not died recently. Bitter sweet.",6

A complete hype,20 June 2019,"I have watched the movie when it was just released. A couple of months later and I was looking at the reviews. I cannot believe all the 10/10 scores for this movie.

Personally I was extremely disappointed with this final movie. Infinity war was an amazing good movie, end game delivers a very simple story based on the time machine concept with plenty of flaws. While I understand the hype and the popularity of the MCU the movie was not bringing me what I was hoping for. There is no further clarification of what led to this movie. The new hulk is another example what I believe was too far fetched. But I don't think I should continue. Surely it is a must see, but for me remains Endgame one of the less convincing movie of this long series of movies brought to us in the las ten years.",2
"Story, Action, Comedy and Emotion.",26 April 2019,"Was a great end to the Avengers Series. There was laughter, humour, action, comedy, along with emotions. This had it all. Not sure what the buzz about Captain Marvel was but was quiet irrelevant to this story in my opinion. Hulk, Thor stole the show for me. Iron Man and Cap great as always. The 3 hours flew past. I give it a 9/10 just because of Captain Marvel spoiling it.",9
A marvel to stand the test of time.,26 April 2019,"I'm a huge marvel fan, even to the annoyance of some of my friends, and I think that marvel has produced some of the best to be movies to be released in the past decade. I think films like Guardians of the Galaxy, Thor Ragnarok, and the Captain Americas will age as a definitive part of my generation's history. When the first avengers movie released, I was twelve. It would be no exaggeration to say that the movies that followed were a big part of my teenage years. I'm not even a big action movie guy, but I believe in importance of superheroes.

This was also possibly the best theater experience I've ever had. Watching this with a theater full of fellow fans is an enjoyment of it's own. Watch this with friends. There were plenty of times I couldn't even keep my mouth closed shut.

Even if you're not a marvel fan though, I'm willing to bet you'll still have a blast. The cinematography and effects are nothing if not masterful. Often, the visuals will be enough to stun you completely. The sci fi elements are creative enough to keep the main plot interesting. The character writing is some of the best I've ever seen. The Russo boys really killed it this time, for one last show.

The second act of this movie ends up essentially (but debatable, depending on which movies were your favorites,) a kind of ""Best Hits of Marvel"" mix-tape. Then, in the third act, things get so nutty that you can only see it for yourself. The movie is able to call back to the many movies it is, in a sense both a sequel and tribute to, and yet still hold a new and exciting plot elements to explore. It's this balance that holds the whole thing together.

Somehow, this movie is able to wrap up almost everything the MCU has left open in creative and fun ways. It's satisfying, but more than that, it feels deserved. This is clearly, to anyone who sees it, the height and end of the long, brilliant saga which began with Jon Favreau's Iron Man.

Infinity War was far from perfect, and honestly didn't blow me away in any significant way. This movie did. A million times over, it felt like. It's not just the climax of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, it's a beautiful monument to the works of Stan Lee, Jack Kirby, Steve Ditko, Jim Starlin, and countless others. Avengers Endgame is best described as the ultimate comic book movie.

It's over. And at the same time, it's not.

""...I posit we are in a universe which favours stories. A universe in which no story can ever truly end; in which there can only be continuances. If we are in such a universe, as I hope, then we may have a chance"" -- Neil Gaiman, Marvel 1602

Just go see it. And then see it again. Maybe i'll see you there.",10
One of my favourite movies of all time,27 May 2019,,10
A Heartwarming End to Marvel Phase 3,5 May 2019,"There is a weird glee in watching a movie alone. You start to appreciate the goods and notice the flaws much more easily in a film. Endgame has its flaws. More so than the Infinity war I think. In the infinity war, Thanos was simply an unstoppable force. The sheer desperation to find some way to beat him somehow and still be outmatched by Thanos, in the end, was palpable. Thanos was unwavering; both physically and in the motif - to bring an end to overpopulation. In Endgame, not so much. Thanos only shows physicality and without spoiling it I would say, his motif somehow becomes typically villainous. Thanos is not so much of a ""well-doer of the universe, whatever it takes"" anymore. Another thing is that the Avengers faced quite a less challenge in Endgame, compared to infinity war. Whether it's in procuring a plan to beat him or to execute it, they weren't that much challenged as they were in the previous film. But these things aside, Endgame is a very well rounded film. And boy was it damn enjoyable. Characters were fleshed out really well. The longer screentime really helped in that aspect. All the characters showed heroism and larger than life charisma we expect to see. And the final third of the film was nothing less than spectacular. Endgame is the culmination of 11 years of story-arch. Endgame is the celebration of the end of the Infinity saga. Endgame has achieved something which is really hard to pull off - giving a coherent and satisfying end to the 20 films that came before it. Marvel has succeeded in that aspect and that's where I think DCEU struggles really hard. But Marvel did it flawlessly. Endgame truly is a marvel of a superhero film; and definitely one of the best of MCU; For me, coming in at second place after Captain America Winter Soldier and Civil War. But judging by the hype and rating, is it better than The Dark Knight? NO!!!! Dark Knight still holds the position for the best superhero movie ever made, not even Dark Knight Rises could beat it and Endgame couldn't do it either. MCU and DCEU have the brawn but they don't have the brains of The Dark Knight. But does that make Endgame any less capable? No. Endgame is what Endgame is supposed to be - a heartwarming & proper way to say goodbye to the original Avengers and start a new phase for MCU. And I love it 3000 times <3 #whatever_it_takes",9
Awesome movie with fanservice,29 December 2021,10/10 i loved it. It has fanservice and its a really epic movie. I remember in the crowd screaming when captain lifted thor Hammer. I liked more infinity but this is one is a really awesome movie.,10
fantastic but i think infinity war wins,27 April 2019,Absolutely loved it overall. The only thing I can say is that the there was so much going on that even in a long movie it felt rushed. Could easily add another hour. Great job overall I would just say that infinity war might be the best in the series but really....it was still awesome. I teared up in many scenes. It wasn't that it was sad...sometimes it was. But sometimes it felt so powerful it made me tear up,9

To my surprise,5 May 2019,"I'll be completely honest here. I have never been one for marvel, DC, or any of these types of movies. Quite frankly I would mix the two up until I started watching the movies more and actually understanding what the hype for these movies was all about. My friend is really into these type of movies and for their birthday I decided I would ""take"" (can't drive it almost) them to see Avengers: endgame. On that note that meant I would have had to seen at least a couple of the movies so during the past couple months before this movie came out, I let them choose the movies they wanted to watch (also because I really don't care what movie we watch, I just enjoy spending time with them). 99% the movies chosen were anything marvel so I've grew quite fond of some characters over time. In saying I told them to drive to the theaters cause they asked me where I had wanted to go and then there we were watching the movie. It was a movie that was mixed with comedy, tragedy, and happiness. The actors really did a great job playing their role in the film but I do also give a shout-out to the directors and everyone else that made the movie possible.",9

My Childhood Just Ended...,27 April 2019,"It's start when Tony Stark walk in to some bar and met General Ros to ask assemble team. I'll used to remember my childhood start watch this movie. And again and again every movie make me ages. Iron Man 1, 2 & 3. I'll never leave the movie theater, I'm like having short of fantasy to have another universe exists, and that universe full fill with a lot this superhero. My stress relieve when one of this Marvel universe movie comes. Thor, Caps, Ant Man, Avengers, etc. And I also watch series, agent of shield, agent carter. Its bring joy and happiness.

But it's remind me that everything will be moving on and people will grow up, suddenly we must forget everything and that will be our past. And this movie one of my reflections and also reminder that I have to moving on, face my reality and struggle with real life. This movie really perfect ending for my adventures with all superheroes of marvel in my fantasy, And I'm glad that marvel endgame give the best movie ending all the times.

Every movie with good ending like, wow good movie, nice movie, but endgame give some short memories to us. You never gonna forget until the rest of your life.

So Thank You so much for your every movie you ever created Marvel, After this will not gonna be the same anymore without Mr.Stark.

RIP: Stan Lee. Tony Stark, Natasha..",10
Quite good,18 October 2019,"Quite good, great effects (as expected). It was interesting to see Avengers beaten, broken, a nice phoenix arc. Only downsides are Captain Marvel (damn, that actress is wooden) and one cringy feminist scene, thankfully a very short one. Since many of the best are out/dead (or promised to NOT have a series/movie like Scarlet Witch), I don't think following products will be worth watching. If you are really invested, I would recommend waiting for proper reviews for a few weeks (just ignore ""professional"" critics), or buy it at significant discount later.",8

AVENGERS....assemble!,25 July 2022,"The best of the best, when you think of how a superhero movie needs to be done think of Avengers: Endgame. The epic blockbuster that gave fans all the payoff they deserved after 22 movies and 10 years Robert Downey Jr does a stand out job as his final performance as Iron Man he puts so much heart into his character in this movie, the intensity and well pacing makes this movie super watchable it doesn't feel like three hours and that is a good thing. Marvel knew what they were doing when they made this masterpiece.",10
Satisfying yet emotional,15 October 2019,"Here is my spoiler free review, I often like to discuss the negatives of a movie before the positives so here goes.

I didn't quite enjoy Endgame as much the first time around since I had been spoiled about significant events in the film and it does suffer from quite a few plot holes. Some events aren't explained quite enough and require a good bit of mental gymnastics to hurdle. My main complaint like many others, despite not having much screen time, is Brie Larson (more on that later). Captain Marvel's movie, of which I do share the popular dislike for, was released barely over a month before Endgame. This is important because she is quite arrogant and emotionless in Endgame, a popular argument being Tony Stark is quite arrogant also, however we have had over a decade and 10 movies to watch and understand Stark's backstory and why he is this way, Captain Marvel not so much. I do however give Brie Larson the benefit of the doubt, after seeing how she is in interviews and such, I do believe the blame here lies with the directors. Larson and Marvel seem like completely different people. Her appearance is downgraded later in the movie too. There's also a scene with Fortnite.. which of course speaks for itself.

All of the above is why I simply cannot give it a 10, one may think how can so many negatives only deduct 1 from a perfect score? Well, staying true to a spoiler free review that is quite the task to explain of course.

As with any avid fan like myself and having watched Iron Man in cinemas 11 years ago, here we are 22 movies later and there isn't much more I could've asked for. Lot's of previous questions answered, closure brought to many story-lines, many epic moments and surprises. Had the franchise not been so long until this point, my rating most likely would've been 7.5. Somebody that has watched all previous instalments will appreciate Endgames nods at it's predecessors, lots of rewards for longtime fans. Is it as good as Infinity War? Not quite, it does shortly follow however, up there with my favourites IW, Winter Soldier, and Iron Man. A must watch for any Marvel fan. There are however still unanswered questions as with any MCU movie, which will most likely be answered in the upcoming titles.

TLDR: Slightly political, plot holes and an undesirable character that ultimately get's trumped by the excellence of the other 95%",9

It served as the grand Finale for all of the previous Marvel films, but felt like more of a fan service orgy instead of a neatly wrapped present only missing the bow to finish it off. Everything feels rushed just to get more and more screen time for the fan service. Still a watch by any means just ultimately disappointing compared to other good Marvel films.",7
Epic Closing,27 April 2019,"Though it doesn't contain as many actions as Infinity War, it does have strong stories and perfection.

It's like comic book thrown onto screen,24 April 2019,"Well, Russo brothers did it again. Those 3 hours felt like half hour or less. After watching this story reached its end, I really must say - there is no movie universe like MCU. I love DC and other superhero movies also, but after seeing Endgame - everyone (and that includes future Marvel) really must try hard to beat this 10 years long story and I hope that it will happen again. A man can hope, right?

If you read any comic book that has really good story with real stakes (every hero can die) that spans over years and you reached its final number, climax of it all and you are blown away by it - I'm sure you will recognize that feeling while watching this movie (especially in the final GREAT scene, but I don't want to spoil it to you).

When I came home from cinema, I needed another ""shot"" of our heroes so I immidiately watched first Avengers movie and Avengers: Age of Ultron. But that is not enough: today I will watch Infinity war at home and Endgame once more in cinema.

Than you all for a great movie(s)!

It hurts me to have to say goodbye,26 April 2019,"It might have just been a year since the mouth-opening climax of Avengers: Infinity War, It might have just been 7 years since the first Avengers film, when all 6 superheroes teamup, But it has been 11 years since the beginning of MCU. 11 years, 22 movies, 1 studio. is no doubt that the directors and the teams of visual effects and writing have put their hearts and souls into this masterpiece. The best thing about this film is that even though this movie is about 181 minutes long, it just doesn't feel like it and I was craving for more. They've given so much pressure and importance to character development this time, which felt highly unlikely in a Marvel film, and have succeeded unequivocally. We get to spend so much of the first half with our original Avengers and get to know their griefs. Avengers: Endgame can be described as the wildest, WILDEST dream of Marvel comics fan come alive. A decade ago, people thought of superheroes as ""people with powers"" and that was about it, but the 11 years of built-up have given each of these characters their own time to fight, to kill, to mourn and to finish, and this has bonded us to them, THIS is why we love Marvel movies, and this is also why we don't love DCEU films. At last, I would like to sign off by saying that ""don't be sad, because this may be the end of most of our beloved heroes, but there are several more to come...",9

Lots of funny scenes in the movie as always. Only concern i left the cinema with a few questions, sure they will be answered soon after most have watched it. It's a 3 hours movie that doesn't make you feel like watching 3 hours, even if it would go 3,5 hours or more you would still sitting and watch it and time would flow away. But the feeling you get in the end is that an Era came to it's end.",9

A film that is ultimately saved by its incredible final act.,18 March 2020,"I used to hail this film as some sort of masterpiece for months, and then every time I rewatched it I just started to like it less. To Endgame's credit, it wraps up a lot of things beautifully and has some genuinely tear-jerking scenes. Tony, Steve, Natasha and Clint had their arcs wrapped up fantastically (even if Steve has a bit of a grey area relating to another 100 year old man he said he'd be with ""until the end of the line"") and the CGI is obviously top tier. Coupled with an absolutely incredible third act that is paced perfectly, filled with some of the best delivered fan service I have ever seen and has one of the most epic, emotionally powerful scenes that I have ever seen from any film, and it always gives me goosebumps.

But when you take away that third act as well as the payoffs that were executed well, Endgame starts to fall apart quickly. Thor and Hulk had genuinely awful conclusions to their character arcs. Thor's one is definitely the most divisive among fans and I definitely see what they tried to do and it certainly made sense considering the narrative, but the way it was executed just didn't work. Hulk on the other hand was just straight up confusing, with his entire arc that was built up through Infinity War being solved OFF SCREEN and then not having him do anything for a good chunk of the movie. Not only that but the movie is a complete mishmash of tones. It's argued that Infinity War also had this problem to some extent, but it was able to actually balance those tones well considering the movie's structure and pacing. In Endgame, the emotional scenes and the comedy scenes are too close together and don't get enough time to breathe. I know it might be too much to ask a three hour movie to take a little more time with its pacing, but the second act of this film is an utter mess. Granted, some of the emotional scenes do work and the jokes aren't half bad (unless they involve Thor), but they are placed so sporadically that it just comes off as distracting. THEN there's the whole time travel fiasco. The time travel in Endgame, when explained, does genuinely make sense, it's just that when they try to incorporate the Infinity Stones into the time travel as if they control the flow of time then the movie collapses. It completely contradicts what we've been led to believe about the time travel that they're trying to do and generally doesn't make any sense. If they're simply going to an alternate timeline that's in the past, then what part do the Infinity Stones actually play in that? I get changing stuff will create another timeline, but the Infinity Stones creating the flow of time doesn't make a lick of sense at all. And everyone's made a load of memes about it already, but the rat being the thing to kickstart the movie is impossibly contrived and dumb, regardless of Doctor Strange's plan. I don't wanna put a spoiler warning on this review so I won't explain the exact details, but it really is ridiculous.

Other than the second act of the film throwing a wrench in the entire product, the first act is really well done, if just a tad boring at times. It has a consistent tone, balances the comedy and drama relatively well, basically does everything that the second act should've. Even with all of the time travel stuff, Endgame would be a whole lot better if the second act was actually cohesive and had a good balance of tones.

Overall, is Endgame a decent film? I'd say yes, and a satisfying one at that. But is it good? Hard question, because the film is technically well made and has a good first and third act, it's just that the third act takes up so much of the movie and puts so many holes and issues into the whole product. Is it as good as Infinity War? HELL no. Infinity War is still a fantastic film that does everything this movie did but correctly (minus the time travel of course). It is a shame to see the final chapter of the MCU almost go down in flames and to only be saved by a competently done third act, but I guess the Russo's just got a bit carried away when trying to wrap things up.",6
Cinematic Pioneer,27 November 2019,"Endgame takes advantage of multiple genres and elements into a single movie. Involving comedy, mystery, action, drama, and fantasy. The deep character development to 8 unique individuals, instead of just one, is masterful. The contrast between war and peace, as well as the effects it has on people involved was explored on a scale never before seen. The story takes the namesake of the Avengers to a whole new level. I see this winning many Oscars. Best Picture, above all, included.",10

Marvel Avengers: Endgame Film Review - The Final Battle Directed By The Russo Brothers With No End Credit Easter Eggs This Time,6 May 2019,"When Brie Larson arrived on Earth at the end of Captain Marvel she found the remains of Nick Fury's Avengers, the survivors of Josh Brolin's Thanos and his Infinity Stones grab. In Marvel Avengers: Endgame the Russo Brothers must band together this smaller group of superheroes to find Thanos, retrieve the Infinity Stones, and bring back their fallen comrades. The stones must then be returned to their original time in the past. Easy we might imagine in a film with a 181 minutes running time. I saw it opening day but you won't notice the length as it moves at warp speed.

We can see who survived Infinity War from the poster, and thanks to Captain Marvel she brings Robert Downey Jr's Tony Stark back to Earth after his fight with Thanos, with Karen Gillan's Nebula and Bradley Cooper's Rocket, into Gwyneth Paltrow's waiting arms. But there's no time to reminisce as Nebula knows where her father was going after Infinity War. But having achieved his aim Thanos destroyed all the stones.

And with no way to bring back the 50% of the population destroyed, five years later our superheroes have found either domestic bliss, as in Pepper and Tony, Chris Evans's Steve Rogers is running grief counselling sessions, Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow and Don Cheadle's War Machine are running the depleted office and well Hawkeye is really really angry about losing all his family and in Japan taking out gangsters. Jeremy Renner never got an answer to his mustard or mayonnaise question.

Then one day an inquisitive rat presses a button in an old van and we get Paul Rudd's Ant-Man back. And he's a little surprised as to what the hell happened in the last 5 hours he spent inside the quantum realm. And given that time is altered in the quantum realm, maybe our superheroes could travel back to collect all the stones and click their own fingers to bring everyone back. But Tony Stark isn't interested, he has his own family and doesn't want to change time. So maybe another brain might be able to create the quantum tunnel. A really big brain. Mark Ruffalo's Hulk has embraced his green side and is happy to take selfies with kids. And while I read of the year long training and diet that Scarlett Johansson followed for the back-to-back filming of both Infinity War and Endgame, well Chris Hemsworth's Thor has really let it all hang out. He got it easy this year. Nice to see Taika Waititi back as Korg. But having already done his bit with Thanos, Thor is quite happy drinking in the Asgardians' new homeland.

And yet Tony Stark cannot quite stop thinking about a trip Back to the Future. And is even more amazed when his testing actually proves it is possible.

So that's six stones to find; Time, Mind, Space, Reality, Power and Soul, and only one chance for each of the remaining Avengers to find them, and return, with their limited vials of Hank Pym's serum. Not everyone will survive as they split up to find the stones. But what great stories they'll have to tell about their adventures in the past. Although someone has discovered what our superheroes are up to. And he's coming.

I've been following the Marvel Avengers films, and the Marvel Agents of Shield tv series for a long time now, and Endgame is a fitting climax. Cramming everyone from Marvel into the story line was no mean feat for the writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, but I think everyone made it, even with the blink and you maybe miss them scenes. But the You and Whose Army was mind blowing. Could Captain Marvel have done it all herself I wondered, maybe, but where's the fun in that, anyway she cannot turn back time, and the Avengers have always been a team. Even when they fell out and had civil wars.

With a rumoured budget of $400million the film was a hit the first weekend. Great fun and if you didn't enjoy it you don't have a pulse. Was it the final scene for Stan Lee though?",10

The conclusion of the MCU's Infinity Saga ends on a satisfying note.,11 April 2023,"Five years after Thanos (Josh Brolin) wiped out half of all life in the Universe and Thor (Chris Hemsworth) killed Thanos in rage after learning Thanos had destroyed the Infinity Stones, Scott Lang/Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) re-emerges from the Quantum Realm after having been trapped their 5 years earlier but not having aged a day. With the Avengers now a shadow of the organization it once was, many of the heroes have since gone their separate ways. However Scott Lang believes they could undo Thanos' plan by traveling through time in the Quantum realm.

The concluding chapter of the MCU's Infinity Saga, Avengers: Endgame was shot back-to-back with the same team as Avengers: Infinity War and like Infinity War was one of the most expensive movies ever made with a $400 million budget. Upon release the film broke box office records with a worldwide opening of $1.2 billion before eventually reaching just under $2.8 billion in its final tally, briefly eclipsing Avatar as the highest grossing film of all time (not adjusted for inflation) until Avatar's Chinese re-release. Much like Infinity War, Endgame is epic in both scope and scale touching on every aspect and character of the MCU sending off several characters and developing and building many others.

As with Infinity War, Endgame keeps itself pretty simple in terms of its plot with the main focus and drama coming from the characters and their interactions with one another. The opening act that sees Scott Lang re-emerge in the MCU after five years have passed since Thanos enacted his plan nicely build off the often homaged and referenced ending of Infinity War wherein several prominent characters and half of the Universe's population were blinked out of existence. As this is the same team that gave us the second and third Captain America films as well as Infinity War, it should surprise no one that despite handling a large cast every character feels like they're given their due in both character and action. The time travel aspect is nicely incorporated with the audience getting to see several big moments in the MCU from another angle and even characters who were written off get a second chance to appear. Some of the creative decisions I'm not quite sure how I felt about (particularly in regards to an element of the Guardians of the Galaxy felt like it was reset back to zero) but for every moment that didn't land, there were several that did.

Avengers: Endgame isn't quite as good as the setup in Infinity War, but in terms of concluding chapters for film series especially when taking into account the large number of movies setup over an 11 year period this is probably about as good as it gets.",9

The film itself is a continuation of the previous film - Avengers Infinity War, which ended with the defeat of the main characters. In the same movie, we see the consequences of this defeat, as the whole planet survives it, including the main characters.

The performance of all the actors is excellent, everyone both played well and plays. They conveyed their characters very well, which is now rare.

The graphics in the movie are amazing, the special effects are at a great level, in general, nothing bad can be said about these moments.

Even though it's sad and heart-breaking at some points, the overall feeling it leaves you with is pure awe and wanting for more. The sadness is well-deserved for some beloved characters but it's all done logically and in a noble way.

The audience and I laughed a good deal throughout the movie (just like it was with Ragnarok), and 3 hours passed in an instant, I didn't get bored and didn't feel tired at the end. However I am speechless at the grandeur and scale of this finale.

I have nothing else to say here (or have I?) except for: I envy all of you who is yet to enjoy all the twists and turns of this beautiful movie for the very first time!:)

The last hour was excellent, and the action exceeded expectation. Of course, there are some holes in the plot, but Marvel does not let us down.

"Not the movie I expected, or perfered but a good film nonetheless...",27 April 2019,"Since 2008's ""Iron Man"" we have witnessed Marvel Studios release a cinematic jigsaw puzzle culminating with ""Avengers: Endgame"", its final piece. We have been introduced to many characters, seen a variety of storylines and invested in the many films the studio has released over this 11-year span. If you have been a complete and loyal fan of these films, Endgame is your ultimate reward. Because of the anticipation, the risk of ruining the many surprises the film holds and the chance of you going into the film with too much knowledge of its plot, I will not divulge a single aspect of its story. I am only going to attempt to give my final conclusions in the vaguest way I can. If you haven't heard, the film clocks in at 3 hours, one minute. A truly daunting and risky gamble of the filmmakers, Anthony & Joe Russo, because no other film of this genre has been this epic in length. In some ways it helps the film and, in some ways, it hurts it as well. The first act of the film, an hour to hour and half, is rather slow paced. It says some things that has to be said as well as sets up many important aspects that will come to play later in the film, but trust me this part of Endgame is not the action roller-coaster that ""Avengers: Infinity War"" was, but it also doesn't involve as many characters and storylines as that film did (something that was many people's chief complaint). The first act could have been trimmed, written at a better pace or even had some more excitement added to it but that isn't my biggest complaint about this part of the film. For me one of my biggest problems with how comic films have been adapted to the big screen is their propensity to alter the very fabric of established characters and rewrite them to become very different than what I knew them to be when I followed them as a young comic reader. Without naming who they are, we find drastic differences and changes with some of the characters. Some I found to be interesting, others I found troubling and one, although done in the comics when I was still reading them, was a big disappointment. I will even go so far as to say how that superhero was treated creatively in the script in this and the previous film, is one of the most disappointing aspects of the films. The film picks up the pace and its entertainment value in the second act, the part of the film I really loved. If I say too much you will have some huge surprises ruined, but I will say if you are a fan of the previous films in the Marvel Universe, it will be a huge treat for you. Throughout the film, a common element that has been persistent in the Marvel movies is the use of humor and this film is no different. The laughs come all thought this film but I think the jokes worked the best during this part of the film. The action picks up as well as the overall pace. Most of the scenes in the section make the movie worth the price of admission. It might be the section of the film that will be please the fans the most and even helps alleviate some of the first acts' mistakes. By the time we get to the film's epic final act you might be a little worn and weary, but trust me when I tell you it is a cinematic achievement rarely seen. Fans will be cheering, and its probably the part of the film I would recommend seeing with other Marvel fans. Like the previous parts of the film, there are some surprises and laughs. But I will also contend that it had one flaw, not enough to ruin the film, but certainly a true complaint and I will just mention it with a hint; the end felt like Peter Jackson directed it. Overall, I will say I would recommend ""Avengers: Endgame"" for obvious reasons, if you have followed the previous Marvel films it is an absolute must see. If you have missed many of the films and are one of the very few that hasn't seen ""Avengers: Infinity War"", I would actually recommend you wait until you know more about the storyline, you will truly be lost. I wasn't dismayed with the film, just certain aspects and smaller details. ""Avengers: Endgame"" is a fitting end in many ways and will overall leave you satisfied. Some will probably walk away thinking it is one of the greatest comic superhero films ever made, I wasn't but that's ok. We all have our own taste and opinions.",7
The perfect ending to an amazing journey!,25 April 2019,"I had the chance to see this movie twice, midnight of the 23rd and again on the 24th as I live in Egypt and luckily the movie came out early and thank god to that. I will not spoil anything all I can say is the magic of this one marvel movie depended on the acting not on the visual effects. Throughout the movie I had all sorts of feelings from the first 10 seconds of the movie. I honestly don't care about those who keep saying that the ending of the movie was predicted and satisfying to the fans, all I know is this movie took me everywhere emotionally the two times! Thank you marvel studios and Disney for the perfect experience, it was way more than I expected and that is enough for me.",10
I enjoyed it.,1 May 2019,"I'm not a fan of the Marvel series. However I have always given them a chance. I feel they sometimes sell themselves very short and bombard us with so much poor CGI we don't know where to look next. The comedy has always been a bit cringe worthy and on the whole I've never wanted to go back and watch for a second time. Endgame has finally changed that. I laughed, I had a lump in my throat and I didn't have a headache from the constant bombardment of over the top scenes. I've felt that Marvel could do what the makers of the recent Star Wars movies have done and that's strip back the cgi and actually make something of a movie. It felt to a point that they tried to that here. But. It isn't perfect. It's long. The first 2/3rds are such a slow burn you start to wonder when it would finally get going. The small pockets of Thor's funny scenes are just about enough to save it. For Marvel fans I imagine they will be talking about it for years to come but for regular movie goers. It's enjoyable.",7

⭐8.7 - An Epic Stand-out Movie that is the Conclusion I have only Dreamt of,1 May 2019,"WARNING: this review, like others, may give you a bias when watching the movie. Please keep in mind that this is mostly my opinion.

From the end of 'Avengers: Infinity War' I have felt as though the story was incomplete, as though the movie ended before the climax. But I guess that was the point. Because Endgame is the climax, the finale, the ultimate conclusion.

The opening few minutes were ingenious for building on the concept of how impactful Thanos' actions were. Someone must have cried in that scene. I can't say I saw what was coming in the next, maybe, 20 minutes.

Moreover, it was even harder to think of what could possibly come AFTER those 20 minutes. But I suppose with the Infinity Gauntlet about, there's no telling what will happen, which kills the sense of wonder in this Marvel universe. Besides these 20 minutes, I was not that impressed by the remaining first half of the movie, but boy, did the last half pay off! Movies like this make me wonder if cinematography can get any better (for example, the opening scene of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice).

I am not a huge Marvel fan, so I won't be able to notice all of the inconsistencies that this movie apparently has with the first movie (according to several fans I know), but I am confident that Marvel Studios has the answers. I always did like the first The Avengers movie, by the way.

I don't like what happened to Thor (if you have seen the movie, then you'll know what I mean) and the Hulk thing was weird at first, but I got used to it.

Maybe I'm the only one who didn't find this movie ""an emotional rollercoaster"", but then again, I'm not a huge Marvel fan. Similarly, I didn't get most of the jokes even though I have seen most of the movies. Regardless, the movie sure doesn't disappoint and I liked the ending, too.

I primarily gave this movie a ⭐9 because of how much it stands out from the other (is it 21?) movies.",9

Dissatisfied,2 August 2019,"I have been a Marvel Fan since my childhood. It all started with Iron-Man and then flourished by the other movies in MCU! I watched each and every film to date. For a MCU admirer like me ; this film was disappointing to say the least. When infinity war ended, I was literally teared up by the experience I got. It boosted the hype, the anticipation to a new level! I was counting on the finale film to be the best I have ever seen in the MCU so far. But that dream, that wish of mine got shattered! Why? There are so many reasons behind it! Slow pace till the time travel sequences kicked up, lack of cohesiveness between the characters, not duly written script, lesser emotional impact ; all of these made the film less enjoyable for me. The only thing that saved it from being doomed for me is the Last 1 hour, the climax battle scenes are beautifully made. To have all the superheroes in one place and give proper screen times to everyone is a daunting task. They handled it pretty well! The performances especially from RDJ was memorable and touching at the same moment. Overall a decent film for my liking and for my expectancy that I had after The last film. It Should have been way way better. All of the True Marvel fans deserved it.",7

The movie isnt 3 hours,6 May 2019,Without the credits. The movie is 2 hours and 40 mins. The movie is boring at the start. It has a slow build up. It gets good..,9
Marvel sticks the landing,27 April 2019,"It's easy to be jaded. So many great shows and movie series build up and up, only to end with a whimper, retroactively stripping the earlier material of much of its quality. They get you to care about the characters, they get you involved in the plot, only to pull a ridiculous left turn or lose their way entirely, hobbling off into oblivion.

Marvel could have joined those ranks. In fact, it was hard to see how they wouldn't do that. With all they'd built up over a decade plus, if they didn't deliver a great finale, it would have cast a retroactive shadow. Thankfully, I'm happy to say, they delivered all they needed to and more, cementing what will become known as the ""Infinity Saga"" as a generation-defining cultural behemoth that my kids will show their kids just as I've shared Star Wars with my own.

The movie is just over 3 hours, but it very much needs all of that time to tell the story it needs to tell. The scale of this thing is mind-boggling. So many huge actors. So many characters. It could have been a mess.

Instead, it hits all its marks expertly. It is both genuinely funny and genuinely emotional. The action serves a purpose and can be followed. The characters follow unforced, natural arcs that don't feel contrived or predetermined.

The movie focuses on Iron Man and Captain America above all, which is appropriate - they have been the divided (sometimes violently so) heart of the Avengers since at least Civil War, and their somewhat competing visions have shaped everything else. In the end, I left with an overwhelming sense that the story had gone exactly where it needed to go. It was fulfilling. I am in awe of the fact that they pulled this off.",10

Very good Movie... but infinity War was defo better,28 April 2019,,7
Disappointing as a standalone,28 May 2019,"This movie in my opinion was considerably worse than Infinity War, too many inconsistencies and boring scenes which did not contribute much to the characters or the progression of the story. Much of the first 30-40 minutes of the film felt like filler put into the film in order to highlight the actors/actresses ability to act without many other implications to the story.

Hulk and Thor do steal the show completely without a doubt however. Lastly, if the aggregious product placement was not completely off putting to you, then there is not much to say.",4

I can see this movie pleasing both hardcore MCU fans and causal viewers however you at least need to see Infinity war before watching Endgame. The acting, visual effects and overall story were great and will have probably set the bar for all superhero films to come. The only place I could see problems with the film were with the tone and pacing but they were just minor issues that are more than likely to happen with a 3 hour film. This movie is definitely worth the watch and is sure to be an instant classic.",9

Just finished the movie and this will not contain any spoilers but I need to voice my heart to all Marvel lovers... 22 movies over 11 years and this one movie profoundly used all of them in the final conclusion. My heart is saddened by the end but so over joyed by the extreme care the Russo brothers took to preserve stan lees finally curtain call. This movie was the perfect mix of humor and emotion and I can tell you I have never cried so much in a movie ever... Being an iron man can it truly does end exactly where it begun!!! Phenomenal movie, true cinematic perfection and this movie will sweep come oscars time. But words cannot express my feelings!

Mind Blowing Movie,21 March 2020,Awsome Movie Great ending.i was surprised when all the avengers were gathered in one place.But it has a emotional ending.I Love You 3000 IRONMAN !,10
"Good, but not the best, not even close !",27 April 2019,"It's all about a Marvel movie which takes the same old road to glory: new and old characters all put together, stories that cross one another and turns that we +/- expected. In my humble opinion it doesn't deserve the #5, not even top #100 ...",7
So disappointed in this no plot waste of time,29 April 2019,"Unoriginal, way too long, more comedy than action, outstanding special effects as usual but the story was so lame. Expected way more out of this. I wish I would have waited to watch on dvd or TBS for free!! Waste of money and time",3

Too disapointed,5 June 2019,"We need the movie like the end of all things marvel bring to the world. Not the movie can not understand about the time travel and the last fight too boring. I was spend 3 hours of my life at the theather and told my wife: ""do you understand?"" she said: ""no""",7

This is why we go to the Movies,27 April 2019,"This is a movie best enjoyed on the Big screen, with a large audience. We can nitpick and overanalyze small plot details, but overall, Marvel Studios has delivered a great experience. To tie all these movies together, as best they could, is no small achievement. As more people continue to stay home and stream content, this movie is a reminder of the true power of cinema.",8
Endgame is an amazing end to the current roster of heroes,3 May 2019,Despite its flaws this movie is an amazing ending for the heroes we come to love throughout the last decade. Years of build up leads to an emotional rollercoaster with fan-service done right.,8

Endgame,3 March 2022,"I usually do not watch movies twice in such a short amount of time. But after I did the Double Feature (at the Midnight premiere) with Infinity War almost 2 weeks ago, I re-watched Endgame yesterday and it was as amazing as my first impression of it was! And while I will not spoil anything about Endgame, I will talk about things Infinity War! So if you have not seen that yet, do not blame me for anything revealed here.",7
Maximum mediocrity,12 May 2019,This film was too long. The dialogues were boring and formalistic Overall it represents the maximum of mediocrity. It felt pretty much like when you eat too much candy.,4

Sadly is the last .,3 January 2022,"Saldly is the last movie , I had my doubts about this movie, but it came trough, i like the story , the characters , actors are in tip top shape with the roles.

Josh Brolin, brother, u played very well thanos, you know is a well played when I want to hurt you ,torture and then kill you, bring you back to life and kill you again. I felt so much angre and hate for thanos, i want it to fight along The Avengers just to see thanos dead. To bad that we will never see this team togeter anymore.",9
Very recommended movie,27 April 2019,"Best movie ever to watch, Very emotional, powerful, satisfying",10
Avengers: Endgame is the End of an Era,7 May 2019,,10
"A good film, but a little below expectations",11 April 2021,,7
Good overall with a very emotional ending.,10 June 2019,Overall Endgame was a solid movie. The first hour of the film may seem a little sluggish but the action and story telling makes up for it. The ending and fight scenes were amazing. Overall good film u recommend watching a couple times in theater and adding to your home video collection.,8
"Its good, but these reviews are off.",27 April 2019,Lets be honest... Avengers Infinity War was 1000x better than Endgame.,7
Lack of any real charm,11 May 2019,"If you want to watch some visual eye candy, forget about character development, and story writing. Even throw away consistency and continuity, then be relieved when its over, then this is for you.

Too many fan boys and sheep, following bought and paid for critic reviews. Good films have given way, to basically some pretty images smashed together, and so simplified yet terribly written scripts, that it basically makes no sense in even how the writers wrote it. I'm shocked and applaud at the good reviews for this.

P.s. Diploma in film and television, and a degree in creative writing",4
"A good movie, but maybe I expected too much",25 April 2019,"Endgame is a good movie. There is a lot of quality. But after all the hype and the excellent ""Infinity War"" I probably expected too much.

What I liked: The actors did a great job, esp. Robert Downey Junior. The screentime of Captain Marvel was reduced to a tolerable minimum. Our original heroes all get their moments to shine. Humor was hit and miss but mostly it worked. The ""Thor is a slob now"" joke was a bit overused though. The end battle is pretty epic.

What I disliked: There was not enough action and the story drags at times. The Time Travel idea was probably the only way out of the corner the writers had written themselves in after Infinity War and there are also the typical problems/plotholes that come with time travel stories.

It's not the best MCU movie but I can't dispute its good conclusion.",8
Fantastic movie,25 April 2019,"Masterpiece, end of an era. Great movie. The best marvel-movie ever made.",10
M A G N I F I C A N T,26 April 2019,Absolutely speecheless. Magnificant. Go watch now!,10
Amazing,27 April 2019,Started off slow but got better. Such a sad movie but still amazing.,10
Just the best superhero movie i seen,5 May 2019,"My first review, as this movie totally deserves it.

I think Infinity war and Edgame are both amazing movies. Nowadays is hard to make a movie and satisfy everyone, as people have extremely high expectations and we are being so spoilt. Some people saying that Infinity War was better, but cmoon.. its so hard to make something even better than Infinity War. But i think MCU did an amazing job with Endgame.",10
MARVEL MASTERPIECE,6 May 2019,Absolute perfection showing that even superheroes suffer the same as regular people and help showcasing depression and coping with loss with action and humour all mixed in to 3 hrs that just flew by. The perfect end to a perfect saga,10
"Expected much more, overall not so bad",1 May 2019,"Inferior to Infinity War, there were funny and exciting moments, but not as much as in IW",7
Hard work and patience pays off,4 May 2019,This film was an emotionally resonant and wholly satisfying conclusion to the Infinity Saga. It goes to show how much it pays off when a visionary takes his time carefully crafting a Cinematic Universe. 11 years culimated into this awe-inspiring spectacle.,8
Bad Time Machine,6 May 2019,"I think the director didn't want to get a dizzy about time machine. It made some questions about the plot, for example: -When the ending war was happened? Years? Why past thanos can find the present avenger? -How can Capt America getting older?",7
Terrible movie,29 April 2019,"Far too long and uninteresting. No character development. Pacing between large battles and dialogues way off, making both of them equally boring and drawn out.",1
A worthy conclusion,28 April 2019,"There are so many great moments in this movie, both the moments that expand on characters' relationships and the fan service ""hero shot"" moments. To be honest, I can't think of a single moment that I wanted to see that was not included. An awesome movie!",10
Thank u MARVEL ❤❤,27 April 2019,"Ths movie is just EPIC 🔥🔥 Yes thts d word i find now aftr watchng End game..

Wow,25 April 2019,,10
Avengers: Endgame,25 April 2019,"Normally I would make a quip in my title but no. This film deserves to be seen as it is; a beauty.

Pros;
RDJ, Jeremy Renner, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Chris Evans & surprisingly Karen Gillan are no short of fantastic. Each actor truly delves into their characters and give masterful performances. Gillan was a nice surprise in how much she did and changed from her previous films.
The CGI was (I will say) near flawless. Nothing ever looked completely fake and most looked incredibly realistic.
The actions was gorgeous. Seriously; if it were a fetish, you would enjoy yourself TOO much.
It abides so Well to the continuity and is believable in its world. We see the events of Infinity War taking a toll on the world, we get rich callbacks to (Nearly) every single film!


Cons;


Verdict; The mould is broken, the tables have turned. As a beautiful show of the MCU's patience & Storytelling, Avengers: Endgame exceeds its hype, it's expectations and will break you. See it whilst you can in cinema.",
Endgame: Review,8 June 2019,,10
The Russo Brothers have managed to pull off a gargantuan task and I'm blown away! (Spoiler Free),21 May 2019,"I actually saw Avengers: Endgame the first day itself and lost my voice for a week, but I'm reviewing it now because I've seen it today in 3D 4DX, the best version of a 3D movie having talking rats and purple giants. And about the movie, it is 3 hours of satisfying nods and callbacks to our beloved MCU movies, and every second of every MCU movie has built up to this excruciatingly awesome, epic, gargantuan conclusion which is worth every bit of hype. I'm not gonna say anything about the story because, believe me, you don't wanna know it. And Robert Downey Jr. deserves the Oscar for the best actor. The directors and the screenwriters have done a splendid job giving the most satisfying conclusions to Tony Stark's and Steve Rogers' character arcs. Special shoutout to Alan Silvestri for his electrifying and goosebump-inducing music, I almost had a cardiac arrest with his music. This movie is the best of the best movies, the very best. Thank you, Marvel. Thank you, the Russo brothers, Thank you Stan Lee, and Thank you, Robert Downey Jr. for entertaining us for these 11 years. We and the universe will surely miss Tony and Steve. We love you 3,000, Marvel! Thanks!",10
Good but could have been better,26 December 2019,"Well it is quite obvious that avengers lovers are going to be sad about the ending..I appreciated the movie but I think that there could have been a better ending. Characters like Thor and captain Marvel have had less importance in the ending. It would have been better if Thor would have possessed an ultimate power,with his 2 hammers. which could kill Thanos Or, Captain Marvel and Thor could have battled Thanos. Iron man and the other avengers could have then joined hands to exterminate Thanos and destroy the infinity stones once and for all",7
A carousel of emotions! Worth to watch!,2 June 2019,"An amazing movie, emotional, funny and with so much action! One of my favourite movies! It is worth watching! You have to see it!",10
Exactly what you'd expected to see,2 August 2019,"I like superhero flicks. Being honest though, there is a certain 'sameness' to most of them. Avengers: Endgame could be called the granddaddy of all superhero movies, I suppose. At just a touch over 3 hours long, it is certainly far longer than most. It probably features more superheroes than most too. At one point, I think every Marvel superhero that ever existed was on screen - (except, curiously, the X-Men). Yes, a lot of time, effort, creativity and money - lots of money - went into this. Sadly, it left me feeling kind of flat. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed it, but I didn't love it. In fact, I didn't feel anything when it was over - no sadness at the losses incurred, no exhilaration at the victories. Nothing. I never found myself on the edge of my seat once. This may have been Marvel's great battle-of-our-time movie, but it was no Lord of the Rings: Return of the King (now THAT was a movie that pulled you in!). So, I guess we're left asking where to now Marvel? Do we care? I know I'll keep watching what you put out, but the lustre is starting to wear thin.",7
End game mistakes,30 April 2019,First thing is Thor is a stronger character that can make huge changes without stark's Death Second thing is captain America can have Thor's power because oden whispered to his hamer that one will have it only So the mistakes I saw there was Thor was useless and captain America got his power Third thing is captain marvel didn't make any changes so the purpose of this character is making money !!!!,1
"Tears, lots of them.",25 April 2019,,
A treat for us all.,24 April 2019,"Wow, that's the word I want to start with so there will be no confusion about this movie. It's almost brilliant, to get us hyped for a movie after years of building and to deliver. Amazing. The perfect mix of humor, drama, action and suspense, the perfect cast and the brilliant story writing makes this movie the best of all the superhero movies ever made. And it was enough for now. I came to love all the characters and even the less popular ones got great respect. It was a Rollercoaster ride, a thrill with a family like saus that made this 36 Yr old guy cry like a 12 Yr old kid. There was one moment of criticism for me personally and that was the political correct women are strong message that this movie did not need. Not one moment I had the feeling that women or men where more or less important and needed a moral boost but even That didn't ruin the moment and man, that moment was glorious.",10
Best Superhero Movie Ever,21 April 2021,,10
Have to see it again.,24 April 2019,Very powerful and full filling movie. Best superheroes movie ever,10
It deserves its review and probably more,8 May 2019,This movie is unarguably one of the best movies of all time.,8
Crowning achievement for not only super hero ganre but for whole cenimaic art,18 January 2020,What mcu did in last 11 years it is cinematic achievement and worth for celebration . Endgame is celebration of last11 years of storytelling. Endgame give us perfect ending for saga,10
A perfect finale,5 June 2021,"Every time I watch this movie, I'm reminded of how amazing it is. The action, the characters are all great. It's truly the EndGame.",10
Thank God it Ended,13 September 2019,,7
Gonna miss the first gen of Avengers,24 September 2021,"I watched it today, it's wasn't the best film but it is the things of emotional, 10 years since IRON MAN 1 released.",10
Hulk blues,28 June 2020,I love The Avengers movies for what they are. I read comics & in my teens i was hooked on Hulk (still my fav) but what they did to Hulk in these movies is a disgrace. When Scarlett Witch got in Hulks head & then Ragnarok happened I was very hopeful for World Breaker Hulk but then we got Professor Hulk!? They ruined Hulk.. flat out ruined. & Drax is far more powerful than what these movies suggested.,7
I regret loosing my money in that,25 May 2019,"I'd prefered seen dumbo ! I loved infinity war, but this one is so disapointing ! It's just à other movies of 33% Ironman, 32% captain america, 31% thor. And 4% for the rest of the bande without a good scenario or strory. Characters are not treated properly I feel used / stole my money. Captain Marvel is not in the movies at all. Even Thanos is so badly explain...",3

"11 years, 22 Films, The ending we all deserve!",24 April 2019,"I'm going to try and keep this short and to the point as I have a tendency to get carried away when I'm excited...

.....no Spoiler's here.

To sum 'End Game' up in one word, I will say - EPIC! And I really mean epic in every sense of the word. This. Film. Is. EPIC!!! The Russo brothers have succeeded in delivering an ending that feels deserved. It seriously pays off. There are so many references and call-backs to the films that have now spand 10+ years that show these two film maker's are trully passionate about these character's and telling their stories in the most satisfying ways. Trying not to sound cliche here - the film really IS a love letter to the fans. End Game is an epic (I know I've said ""epic"" a lot), engrossing, superhero extravaganza that will go down in film history as a masterpiece! I can confidently say that this is the best superhero film ever made! Not sure if Marvel can or will ever reach these heights again but one thing is certain - I will still be around for the ride ;)",10
Depression,25 June 2020,I like the bit where the back of his hand lights up different colours,10
Great ending,22 July 2019,"Amazing how Marvel has created this cinematic universe. So many good stories, all connected. This movie was long but great to watch.",9
A great movie,11 June 2019,"Awesome movie, very epic. I advise everyone to see it.",10
Bitter sweet good bye!,12 June 2019,,10
AMAZING AND WONDERFUL MOVIE,12 June 2019,With some misfortunes but an amazing script and a wonderful interpretation of part of the actors,10
"Great character arc closure, terrible villian.",13 September 2019,,7
AND WE'RE DONE...OR ARE WE?...,6 May 2019,"The wrap-up to last's year Infinity War is a satisfying wellspring of closure to many of our Marvel faves as the battle against Thanos & his minions to save the universe & perhaps restore the lost lives that were disappeared when the snap heard around the universe was instituted. Not going into the outcomes of some characters or mucking about in spoilers, this effort by the Russo brothers is gargantuan in scope & intent as multiple storylines through 22 separate films comes to a head. Whether you come from your screening satisfied or frustrated, you must give heed to the Herculean effort attempted & accomplished. This is surely a film for the ages.",10
"A fun, but ultimately messy affair",27 April 2019,"Endgame is a good movie which achieves its ultimate goal of tieing the series, up to now, together. But frankly it's a mess....sometimes a glorious mess but often an incoherent mess. There's a lot to love, but a lot to dismiss. It lacks any great action scenes and spends too much time in discussion, and hackneyed emotional nonsense. The plot is over-stuffed, and the movie suffers from trying to do too much. However, it frequently looks spectacular and is genuinely funny, the clear highlights are Thor, who is hilarious in every scene and Ant-Man who brings levity to a sometimes dour plot.

It's a solid film, but it's not great. 7/10",7
Bad reboot of Avengers: Infinity War,14 August 2019,"OMG! What have I just watched? Remake of Avengers: Infinity War?

The last installment of Avengers looks like another Infinity War with table turning (this time we won) and introduction of few new elements such as Captain Marvel, Ant-Man and time machine. The rest is pretty much the same: whole lot of super-heroes doing crash-smash-flash-zap-bang super-fictional thing we already seen in earlier Avengers. OK, have to admit CGI is awesome but if you strip that the result is below average movie to watch once and leave in archive (if you mistakenly bought disc).

Bottom line, I really don't see End Game as a ""Masterpiece"" just because it filled-up box office emerging on top of all movies. It is not something we have not seen before, no breakthrough, not better than Infinity War. Just good advertising boosted this up on hall of fame scale.",1
Just really blown away and I'm not even a lover of the MCU.,25 April 2019,"This has to easily be my favourite MCU movie and I am so damn impressed with how they managed to pull it off that you care about everyone in it at all of the time. This film never stops and I even cared about and was into the action, which I rarely did before.

I will rewatch this for sure, which I often don't want to do with most of Marvel, and absolutely don't know what to even say anymore. I love it, and as someone who likes superhero movies but often doesn't love them, that just blows me away.

It is so well put together, and just wow. I mean wow. I mean I fell asleep while watching a bunch of these flicks, surely not with this one. Three hours. And they made it work. That's so insane.",
I LOVED IT 3000!!!,4 June 2019,,10
This is the best Marvel movie by far,1 June 2019,,9
I watched this movie 3 times in the cinema,28 August 2021,"The Infinity War movie was better. I watched this movie 3 times in the cinema. I didn't like it very much when I watched it the first time, but I liked it after watching it. The ending of the movie was a bit sad. The battle scene was epic.",10
Omg,15 June 2019,This what I was been waiting for months for and it really good it was the best marvel movie out there and if you dont see this your real missing out over the fun,10
Best Marvel movie ever,19 March 2021,"I had a blast watching this when it first came out, easily my favorite of the MCU films",10
The one we have been waiting for.,29 April 2019,,10
What?,26 April 2019,"I usually hesitate to use words declarative words as best or worst. So this offering by Marvel is somewhere in between the best movie I've ever seen and the worst movie I've ever watched. This being said Endgame felt like the poem ""Casey at the bat"". All full of potential only to strike out.",6
Consistently amazing!!,12 June 2019,Just watched avengers endgame for the second time (still watching the credits) and the first 2/3 made so much more sense!! Been about 6 weeks since I last seen it and I loved it then too! (More so the fight scenes but now I've gotten much more clarity on those marvel Easter eggs!! Very well executed and very smartly orchestrated too!!,10
Not as good as its predecessor,28 April 2019,"Amusing, but don't expect too much. The previous movie was much better.",7
This is sooooo boring and empty in every ways,2 August 2019,"Please don't waste your time on this...Its very boring. It's like they pre-sell the movie with a good ending of infinity war. Its a rip off. Trust me you won't believe this. I quite after 30 minutes.

I am writing this review to alert people: keep your money and time for something else.",1
Here're my two cents,28 April 2019,,
Perfectly balanced as all things should be,5 June 2019,"This movie was actually a 11/10, but I have to make it balanced.",10
Beyond awesome,9 June 2019,"A love letter to everything the MCU has built since 2008. Thanks Kevin Feige, Thanks Joe and Anthony Russo !!",10
"Well, it has all come down to this. 11 years in the making, and this is the culmination of all of it. Was this movie worth the hype? Check out my review below to find out!",29 April 2019,"""Avengers: Endgame"" (2019), directed by Anthony and Joe Russo. Starring Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner and many, many more. Oh man, what a cast! Just like ""Avengers: Infinity War"" (2018), I was blown away by this film. The Russo brothers have done it again! Great story, great acting, great special effects, great sets/locations, and great soundtrack. Every factor is top-notch in this movie! I am not going to spoil this movie. This is all I'm going to say about it. Is this the best superhero movie? No, there are some I personally like better. But, it's in my top 10 best Marvel movies for sure, if not top 5! Overall, the cast is extraordinary, and every character had their own shining moment. I was kind of skeptical about Paul Rudd as Ant-Man. Most of you know that I absolutely hate the Ant-Man comic book character. Nothing against Paul Rudd, but the movie version of Ant-Man is very obnoxious. I was worried he was going to ruin it with one-liners and jokes. But, to my surprise, he was not that bad. He played a critical factor in this movie, and his jokes were few and far between, and actually funny! The other characters are stellar as usual. Under the direction of the Russo Brothers, that's not surprising! That's all I'm going to say, I will not spoil the Endgame. You'll have to go see the movie to find out how good it is for yourself! Believe me, you won't be the same. If you think you know what this movie will be like from watching the trailers, you have no idea what you're in for! Props to you, Anthony and Joe Russo. You guys did a Marvel-ous job again! I look forward to other future movies with your involvement, and I hope you continue to direct other superhero movies in the future! This movie is absolutely worth the money to see it in the theater and also to buy on DVD. Obviously, I give this film a full 5 out of 5 star rating, which equates to 10 out of 10 IMDB stars. If you haven't seen ""Avengers: Endgame"" yet, what are you waiting for? Go check it out if you haven't already! Remember, once you guys see it, DON'T SPOIL THE ENDGAME!

The most epic marvel of all time,24 April 2019,"This is a movie thats really worth your time, especially the final fight. I don't want to spoil the movie but its worth 3 hours of your time",10
Lived up to the hype,4 May 2019,Simply amazing. One of greatest Superhero films I've ever seen. Well done Marvel and the team for a incredible movie. You guys really outdone yourself this time and I can't wait for what lies ahead for the MCU. Like alot people I grew up watching these movies and reading comics so alot of these characters helped me alot when I was a kid. Thank you,10
Back to the Future,25 April 2019,"If Infinity War was Back to the Future 1, Endgame is its 2nd and 3rd part. We get the same battle in a different time, previous scenes from previous movies, same scenes with different outcomes and a lot of satisfactory conclusions for the characters. It's not the same streamlined adventure the first movie was, but this will go down as the biggest obstacle our heroes ever overcame and that's what you will remember in time.",7
the most wonderful movie,29 May 2019,Everything I wanted to see and what I never could dream that would be possible. I expected something great and it was an epic movie,10

The best comic book movie of all time and the best movie ever.,14 October 2019,"After Infinity War there was one thought floating around my mind... how in the hell can they ever hope to top that? The answer? Avengers Endgame. For the bulk of the first act there's a sense of doom and dread, and there's a difficult balance the filmmakers the Russos and writers Stephen Mcfeely and Christopher Markus had to maintain: The balance between drama and appropriate doses of humor.

Not every superhero movie can accomplish that, but it seems like this being the fourth collaboration between the Russos and Mcfeely and Markus, they know the Avengers just as well as us, the audience do. There's several things that make this movie work so beautifully, first and foremost the writing. The Avengers interact better than ever, going from a team to sounding like best friends. They are united by their bond, by their loss and they all feel a moral and ethical duty to do everything and anything in their power to fix what Thanos did, last seen in Infinity War.

The other thing that makes this movie work so great is that there's a point to which the Avengers are at their lowest point... like they look like they are on the verge of absolute defeat... then suddenly... SUDDENLY... something happens and when it does it's the most amazing feeling in the world for us, the audience.

Markus/Mcfeely and the Russos know how to create great tension, which keeps you on the end of your seat and wondering... what's going to happen next?! You might think you know what's going to happen next, but the tension in this film is so great you find yourself wondering because how... how could the Avengers possibly win this time?! I've watched this movie at least 30 times now, and I think I can safely say this movie will never get old for me.

In the end, there's a lot of tears, a lot of smiles, and all around great feelings because after so many decades of being a DC fanboy, the Marvel Cinematic universe has now and forever surpassed DC as the king of Comic book films. Avengers Endgame is an outstanding event film, one that will not be topped for a long time.",

This is not the ending you were hoping for.,2 May 2019,,4
Brilliant Masterpiece,12 May 2019,"Avengers: Endgame was the perfect conclusion to the current MCU as we know it. The intricate focus to details that call back to practically all the previous 21 films is genius. There are great laughs, emotional cries and overwhelmingly exciting surprises. To any fan of the MCU that's followed these beloved characters since Day 1, this is everything and more. I loved it.",10

"Amazing, Outstanding Movie !!!",16 June 2021,"First of all I am big fan of Marvel Cinematic Universe. I watch this movie atleast 20 times. After that i take my pen to write a review. It's an amazing science fiction, adventure and action. I think it is the best movie of all time. I am fan of ""IRON MAN"", ""CAPTAIN AMERICA"" and ""THOR"".

Talking about the cast, i am truly speaking that i am speechless. I have never see in my life this type of outstanding performances or acting of actors/actress. I want to thanks each and everyone. Especially Robert Downey Jr. (Sir), Chris Evans(Sir), Chris Hemsworth (Sir), Joshua James Brolin (Sir).

In ""Infinity War"", after ""Thanos"" wins , the universe is in ruins. With the help of remaining allies, the Avengers assemble once more in order to reverse Thanos' actions by defeating him and restore balance to the universe. Avengers defeated thanos and save the world successfully.

I am overwhelmed with happiness when ""Thanos"" defeated by ""Avenger's"".

The movie climax is something which I can't define in mere words, it is an overwhelming and unforgettable experience which can only be witnessed once you see this movie in the theaters and I am sure you will enjoy it very much.

So, I suggest everyone to see the movie and learn positivity from it.",10
"A treat to watch , money well spent.",2 September 2020,"Loved this. Full on entertainment. If you guys are a superhero freak like me, this one would surely not disappoint you.",10

The most anticipated movie of all time delivers on the hype,24 April 2019,"Ironman came out in 2008 and eleven years later, it all comes down to this. Avengers: Endgame is a visually stunning, well-paced, emotional end to an amazing saga over the last eleven years. With superb acting from Chris Evans and Robert-Downey Jr. leading a now star-studded cast, Avengers: Endgame delivers on all the hype built up over the past year.

10 stars, I highly recommend you watch this must-see film the first chance you get",10
Whatever it takes,11 June 2019,,7
Not bad for Marvel,3 May 2019,,4
A moment from cinema that will be remembered forever.,24 December 2019,"Possibly one of the few superhero movies to invoke so much emotion from beginning till its rolls it curtains, literally. People cheered even louder when the main Avenger's name came out in the credit scene.

If watching the movie on your own is an 8/10, watching it at the cinema on its premiere is a definite 11/10.

It's a moment I won't forget. Thank you Russo brothers, writers, actors/actresses and all for making this possible. Thank you.",
Anyone that gives it below 7 is lying to themselves,28 April 2019,"What an epic end to a 10 year saga of the MCU being a true fan makes you appreciate all the splendid details in the movie with on point writing and visuals, its a true marvel of a movie 😉.",10
Good Movie,3 September 2020,"Ok so, starting off I will admit I have never been huge into the MCU. But goddamn this movie was amazing. Hands down the best fight scene I've ever seen in a non animated film to date. And so far the only action movie to bring me to tears.",10
BEST MCU FILM,8 May 2019,So why the best movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe? I can explain this to you: Think of a film. This is such a film that makes you cry and laugh as well as a strong villain like Thanos.,10
Amazing ending of avengers series,8 May 2019,"I think this is one of the best films in Hollywood history. Although the film has a lot of mystery I do not know when these mysteries will be solved.

Why so many people are obsessed?,9 September 2021,"Good job for the special effects. I know they worked a lot on this. BUT is so stupid that every character is so serious, but you can't take them serious, and it gets realy lame.

I lasted like 15 minutes. I couldn't.

The only super hero movie that is good i think is deadpool, he's funny at least. You can't make a superhero movie with ""serious"" characters, bc it will turn out really bad.",1
The Ending touch,15 May 2019,"If you haven't watched this movie yet, please avoid other people(s) opinions and watch for yourself. The fact that this was the ""End,"" is sad. I have watched every movie pertaining to the characters and watched their journey over the years, so you will become attached to the characters. To see how the End game plays out is both exhilarating and heartbreaking. Don't want to spoil anything, so just watch it!",
Everything about this was done to perfection,24 April 2019,"Amazing movie, blows every marvel movie before it out of the water for me. Infinity War and Winter Soldier were amazing, but the amount of suspense and emotion put into this one beats both of them combined.",10
Cinematic Event of the Millennium,24 April 2019,"I have been a lifelong Marvel fan and ever since the first IronMan which came out in the year 2008, leading up to this movie. After 22 films spanning across 11 franchises in total, this is an absolutely epic conclusion to the finest narrated saga of modern history. The story telling is absolutely phenomenal and every single emotion, thought and effort that has been put in the this film has been nothing short of groundbreaking and astonishing. Hats of Marvel, there is and will only be one name. That name is ""THE AVENGERS"". #Whateverittakes, #Partofthejourneyistheend.",10
An Excellent Movies,24 April 2019,"It was an excellent movies that combine all of marvel superheroes into one. Special effect that even better than movie last year infinity war, and also a very good closing to end this infinity saga.",10
The MCU,8 May 2019,I love how the directors overtly manage to embed and portray potentially cringe moments in the comics on screen!!,10
"Mentally, Physically, and Emotionally Drained",24 April 2019,"I've never written a review on here before so that tells you something. I left the theater mentally, physically, and emotionally exhausted. I laughed. I cried. It was what we have been watching all these years for. It was the perfect ""end"" of an era.",9

Very satisfying,28 April 2019,Overall the film had a very satisfying end to a decade long story.,10
This movie could have been better,31 August 2020,,6
Disappointing - They messed it up with Thanos,10 July 2021,"Not and Avengers fan here but Infinity war was surprisingly good. Very good even thanks to the complexity of Thanos.

They just messed it up in Endgame. Gone the complexity of Thanos. Captain Marvel""s intervention is just lazy writing.

Too long. Boring.

And Falcon??? Seriously???",3
Lucrative Disappointment,14 September 2023,"Is this who men are in the 21st century, making a boat load of money at the expense of ""others?"" In the case of entertainment, the ""others"" can be characters, story, actors, inspiration, and good deeds done. While the Avengers franchise occupies four of the top ten spots on the list of highest grossing action films, ""others"" were sacrificed in eleven ways:

1, who is Steve? The first film could have been, 'Captain America: Steve' for us to learn the heart and soul of the entire franchise; to honor the Steve Rogers spirit in the men and wymin around the world; and to inspire in us all that spirit potential to come alive;

2, these films could have offered Steve more than one beauty. Hayley Atwell's character was not a beauty, inside or out. A man like Steve deserves a few loves who are simply beautiful;

3, Hayley Atwell's character was one-dimensional. To respect and honor the wymin in American military during WWII, her character could have had dimensions; been likeable; and been more attractive;

4, these films could have lifted the world soul by being been more positive and uplifting instead of offering the usual 'man's world' doomsday;

5, these films could have offered Steve Rogers a Life outside of his work (e.g., loving parents, a hobby);

6, the first film made the mistake of killing-off the German doctor. He, too, had the spirit of Steve Rogers; you don't remove those characters;

7, where are femels in top roles in this film (executive producers, directors, composers, etc.)?

8, the filmmaker made the mistake of killing-off The Black Widow. Out of respect for femel viewers, I would have kept her alive until her 90s; and made three or four Black Widow films;

9, films could have boosted itself with Grand Merchandising. Multiple different art collections, sculptural-fine-photographic-visual; costume balls where we can arrive dressed as our favorite character; film-inspired fashion collections for men and wymin; and hired a top jeweler to make the Infinity Stones real, exhibited in a special way, and auctioned;

10, out of respect for their enormous contribution, the filmmakers should have offered the executive producer role to Robert Downey Jr (by The Avengers) and Chris Evans (after film #2);

11, some films were politicized. Is it because America had an African American president 2008-2016 that the story turns to Africa for help? In real Life, Africa struggles to help itself. I would have turned to Asia for characters to assist The Avengers; Asia has experienced incredible growth and acts as an example to us all.",

"Best Marvel Movie Ever, But Watch First Iron Man and Cap beforehand",8 May 2019,"It's just great, I don't want to spoil anything, just trust me. But to make it even better, watch the first iron man and captain America: the first avenger again if you already have or for the first time (and obviously you have to have seen infinity war, but you don't need to rewatch it if you have already seen it)",10
BEST MOVIE OF THE YEAR!,27 April 2019,"WOW! This movie is FANTASTIC in every single regard. I won't spoil anything because I'm not gonna be that guy, but WOW just take my word for it. EVERYTHING about this movie is done right! Thea cting is psot on. The effects are groundbreaking. The story is the one of the most clever stories I've ever seen. The action scenes will go down as one of the best action scenes of all time, FACT. The directing was perfect. The writing was perfect. Just...everything was perfect! Thanos is one of the best film villains in cinematic history! Josh Brolin will get a nomination for best supporting actor at this year's Oscars. I'm betting money on it! Robert Downey Jr may also get a nomination too. Is it feminine of me to say I cried a little bit during multiple parts of this movie? I'm not a liberal and I don't cry easily but WOW, this movie actually pulled at my strings a little bit and I give it mad respect for it! I genuinely think this film will be the one to win best picture at the Oscars in 2020. It will at the very least get a Best Picture nomination with other nominations in best screenplay, directing, actor, supporting actor, and every technical film nomintation like sound and effects. These movies are basically the Call Of Duty of films...they just get better and better, and we never wanna see them stop! GO SEE IT.",10

Oh well, at least this wraps up a lot, ends the major villain plot, has a few laughs, and gives everyone a moment to shine. Sure it has a million logic and continuity flaws, but who cares when you're breezing through so fast. Doesn't feel like three hours and well worth watching. That said, I never want to see another marvel movie let alone re-watch one.",6

A refreshing magnificence,24 April 2019,Avengers End Game is by far the most gorgeous and detailed Cinematic movie ever. Full of emotions and a true character representation. No unnecessary scenes and a true reflection of the hardwork of the MCU. This blissful. Everyone deserves to watch this magnificent piece.,10
Culmination,24 April 2019,"Avengers: Endgame is a culmination of 11 years of cinematic superhero movies that have entertained us on different levels all throughout the years. 22 movies come to an explosive ending here and if the word 'epic' ever had any meaning, this movie would be it. Truly a visceral experience that leaves you heartbroken and shocked from all the events and the insane number of characters and story-lines that they intervene. I loved pretty much everything about this movie, it was indeed a bit slow at the start but I didn't mind as the ending is probably the most spectacular thing I have ever experienced in a cinema. Everyone does an amazing job at acting, but my stand out would be Jeremy Renner who truly shines as Hawkeye. The Russo brothers have accomplished an incredible feat and the entire 181 minutes of this film, serve as minutes that will go down in the history of cinema for decades to come.",9

Very rare amazing-happy-proud feeling after watching a movie,30 April 2019,"I must admit I was more excited than my 12 and 6 yr old kids . My wife made sure to catch up to all previous details Avenger movie before the movie day.We were very proud that we made into the movie so they expectations were sky high.I must admit the movie met those as we didn't realise when 3hrs were over. Movie overall has amazing CGI and interesting plot . MCU has kept correct balance in highlighting characters as per plot requirement and specially given some time for audience to understand aftermath since half of the population of all universal species vanished . Then some interesting twists , humour ,thrills , actions and emotional scenes as movie will progress . The whole 21 MCU movie saga is very well concluded in this Endgame movie. In fact while leaving cinema there will be a thought in the mind if MCU or any other movie venture could ever replicate this experience in future and will be satisfying feeling in mind that it is good I didn't miss first of this kind . Kids loved it , they kept chatting about movie scenes even after reaching home. Overall we loved it !",10

Not revolutionary but entertaining,26 April 2019,"Even though there are still many obnoxious details that bother me a lot like; people refusing to kill one another just so they can say one more glorious line, the whole time traveling thing that makes the entire story meaningless or the overly predictable character realizations of giving up hope but then suddenly changing their minds; I have to admit it was entertaining. What I also have to admit is that its not easy to make a 3-hour-action-movie not feel like a 3-hour-action-movie with correctly balanced audio-visual dynamics.

Remaining Avengers have to travel in time and try to fix what they couldn't prevent in the past.",7

Infinity,15 December 2023,"After Avengers Infinity War, we waited for the Avengers Endgame. We wondered how the story would go on, how our heroes would turn back, what would be the end of Thanos. Many theories related to this have been put forward. Avengers Endgame was undoubtedly the most anticipated film of recent years. Normally, the higher the expectation, the higher the probability of disappointment. But this is not the case for Endgame. Whatever you're expecting, you find much more in the film. This means that the biggest concern about the film has disappeared.

On the other hand, another comparison comes up. Is Endgame more successful than Infinity War? We can comfortably say it Avengers Infinity War is just the beginning of the story. Endgame was the finale of the story. So we shouldn't think of these two films as two separate stories. There is only one story divided into two parts.

Avengers Endgame is, above all, a great homage to the ten-year history of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The story highlights the original Avengers team. Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Hulk, Black Widow and Hawkeye are at the center of events. No character comes in front of them. Of course there are many characters that play an important role in the story outside the original Avengers team. Everyone's concern was that Captain Marvel, who was included in the Marvel world, overshadowed other heroes. We can say that this certainly did not happen. What is important in this struggle is not how strong you are, but how good you are. This comes to the fore in all areas. It gives good message about being a hero and a family.

Of course, Avengers Endgame has some critical aspects. For example, is the three-hour period necessary in terms of the story? It can be discussed. The head of the story moves much slower than the rest. It also drags the heroes into an emotional predicament. Then the tempo is rising and the heavy scenes we are watching are getting more meaningful. The last 45 minutes of the movie is fully action packed. But the last 45 minutes goes so fast that you don't even realize it. Action and battle scenes are really successful. There is not even a slight distress about visual effects. There are also slight logic errors in the film, but in general the story is so successful that these details become meaningless and insignificant after a certain point.

Lastly, Avengers Endgame doesn't have a movie end scene. Because after the film's final, there is no need for another scene. The Marvel legend Stan Lee appears with a small stage. But this is the last surprise scene in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Moreover, there is no clue about Marvel's future. This makes us wonder more about Spider-Man: Far from Home. 10/10 1,888 out of 3,532 found this helpful.",10
This should be the highest rated movie ever.,30 April 2019,"End game, I am now a better person because of end game.

Why?,16 June 2019,Why they didn't include more fighting? 3 hours is too long to a story without a lot ot action scenes in a Superhero's movie,7
Prime Cinema to the Comic fans,4 February 2020,"This is truly cinema. It's a movie that makes us want to go to thw theaters multiple times to watch and rewatch. It's a reward to years of dedication by fans and moviemakers in a new form of storytelling unlike anything before and unlike anything to come. There hasn't been and there won't be anything like Avengers storyline ever again. Martjns Scorcese is just an old mummy jealous that this movie almost made 3 billion in box office, while his Irishman was too boring that we sleep 3 times before concluding it. Also, I'm sorry James Cameron, but Avatar is terrible when compared to this.",10

Spectacular,3 October 2022,"I don't understand the (albeit very few) low ratings for this gem of a movie but I'm guessing they have been made by individuals who have perhaps watched way too many movies of this kind and have thus failed to appreciate this beauty called Avengers: Endgame.

I have not watched many of the Marvel movies but have watched a few in the lead up to Endgame including Infinity War, which was disappointing, to say the least, but Endgame more than made up for it. What a performance. Some of the characters are annoying but the annoying ones don't get too much camera time and they don't (in my opinion) ruin this outstanding masterpiece.",10
Masterpiece!,28 April 2019,"It's a masterpiece! Thank you.

Greatest movie of all time!!,23 February 2020,"I am not exaggerating when i say this movie is the best thing to ever be put on film and will never ever be topped. WELL DONE! But before you watch this, you have to watch avengers infinity war. Its imperative. Also make sure that you have seen Dr Strange, Ant man and the Wasp, and BLACK PANTHER. Those movies have huge plot points that are important to the movie. Then strap yourself in for a 3hr ride of non stop action, drama, humor, and the greatest battle scene of all time.",10
Too many plotholes,27 April 2019,Movie had entirely too many plot holes there were inconsistencies throughout the movie the action scenes were good the drama was good but basically you got to see three main characters let's be honest we all went to see a lot of our favorites and certain characters had one line maybe two,6
Just wow,28 April 2019,Robert downey jr is the best actor I've ever seen ever. Hope he'll comeback one day as a Grandpa in iron man legacy. Love this mcu studios,10
"warning: honest, unbiased review ahead.",25 April 2019,"Although I expected much more from this movie, it is still satisfying for me and a decent finale to the avengers series. The movie starts with showing you how the snap affected one of the heroes life. then followed by the remaining avengers trying to protect the remainig world by fighting crime normally as they were doing before Thanos's time. After losing all hope, Ant-man finally returns to the avengers and introduces an idea that might actually work, but one that he can't carry out himself. This leads to the reunion of the avengers team which will spark events that will change the MCU forever. The pacing of the events is not quiet thorough and some prolonged dramatic scenes fall apart and make you feel bored instead of sad. Also the most exciting and effective parts are all packed in the last hour. one of the technical aspects that I did not like was the blurry transition, the camera takes a long time to focus on a character or un-focus from a scene and move on to the next, which really hurt my eye in the IMAX theater. but overall, it was a nice experience and you shouldn't miss this one, infinity war is still the best MCU movie for me but endgame is among the greatest in the series.",7
Not for kids.,4 May 2019,I had higher expectation from this movie but it turned out to be superheroes drama/comedy mixed with little action. There was very little action in the movie compare to past Avengers. 3d effects were not up to mark either. I was fairly disappointed by this one. If drama is your genre then go for it but if you like action then skip it.,3
A Satisfying Conclusion. Absolutely Worth A Watch.,28 April 2019,This movie had everything that i wanted. I won't spoil a thing. Go watch it and enjoy it to its fullest,8

And it's definitely what I was hoping to see to dramatically close a franchise that, in my opinion, should take a break so as not to saturate the genre.

Although James Cameron deserves to be on the podium of the best of the film industry forever, if Endgame gets to surpass Avatar, it is deserved.

This movie goes straight to my top 10 favorites movies of all time.",9
Greatest movie of the century,28 April 2019,"The best from all mcu universe . Combining visually best action , humour ,suspense , emotions . A must watch . Best story among mcu .",10
Woah.,4 February 2020,"A 3H BEHEMOTH of a finale to a truly unique phenomenon in cinema: a legacy, a build-up, even, of 21 movies over 11 years into this moment. While the movie does reward knowing all the characters, only the main bunch have to be known, and it's obviously best if you've seen Infinity War, since it is the ending of that movie that directly leads into this one, like one big two-parter movie. Heck, it was even shot back-to-back. The two movies combined stand just shy of 5h45"", which is an insane time. At the time of writing, there are a total of 23 movies, with close to a dozen announced for the near future. The 23 movies, up to SM: Far From Home would take over 41 hours to watch! Back the Endgame. It is a heart-wrenching movie, as the characters we have grown to love reach the end of their arcs, and sometimes lives; jam-packed with action and humour (except for the cringy Fortnite reference. Damn you MarvelxEpicGames!! Also Hulk dab was cringy but it was also funny, and kinda made sense? But the fortnite thing really taints the movie. Even if Thor swearing at some internet lowlife is funny, and shows just how low he has gone, from fighting literal Gods to... Noobmaster69. Fat Thor was hilarious, as well as being a nice body message (""I'm still worthy!""), although it is my headcanon that the end fight would have been much easier had Thor been his good old buff self. Sure, beer belly is fine, and those who matter will love you for it, but it still doesn't beat abs my dude. [EDIT: I've thought about it for a while, and also heard other people's opinions, who take it much harsher than I do, but fat Thor was funny and all... But I sincerely hope they revert back to buff Thor again, because it's just better]. It takes an interesting take on time travel, which is a scary topic in a lot of movies, and handles it surprisingly really well! That being said, the movie feels very geared towards us young'uns who grew up watching the movies. My dad, an avid cinema watcher, who does enjoy a lot of the movies in the MCU (although he didn't enjoy GotG, so take that as you will, to understand his different tastes), would probably have some trouble keeping up as everything happens very quickly. That being said, I love how the movie slows down for nobody, the music is another masterpiece in the series, thank you Alan Silvestri (note to Danny Elfman for doing Age of Ultron's music). The cinematography is stunning, the special effects are nothing short of otherworldly, and Captain Marvel has less screen time than Black Widow's PB sandwich, so that's nice (because seriously, that woman is nasty off camera, and a lame addition on camera. I hate superman for the same reasons. Too strong, always the same cryptonite bs. It's a deus ex machina. They made her so powerful she just has to be ""absent"", ""saving other planets"" because Thanos surely isn't a big enough priority. Big Lame.). Of course, it's also notably the first movie to ever overtake J. Cameron's Avatar, (the one which nobody really remembers cause it was so darn generic), and therefore taking the number one highest grossing film (of course, not adjusted for inflation, or Disney's hard push for this including a rerelease with 'extra footage'). Back on topic, while definitely one of the most emotionally charged movies in cinema as far as I'm concerned, it does have a very long legacy to build this up. Consequently, it's hard for me to determine this movie's standalone value. Is it fair to exclude it from its context? I think at least a link to IW needs to be made, since they're two parts of the same movie, really. In any case, the crown jewel in Marvel's crown.",9

Best movie of all time!😍,24 April 2019,"Ohh God... can't trust to my eyes! MCU directors are fricking genius!!! They gave fans what they want with their option of ending.

Thank you guys for the greatest job...😊👍🏼",7
Wow!,5 May 2019,"This was a love letter to the fans, the negative comments are mostly from those who either wanted Endgame to flop -which it did not- or those who decided to watch it without any context just because everyone was talking about it. For those people: this film is not meant for you. Stop hating on things just because most people love them.",9

Huge disappointment,28 April 2019,,1
a labor of love that serves as a fitting conclusion for devoted followers of the MCU,13 May 2019,"The highly anticipated culmination of the Infinity Saga comes to a head in this gripping and episodic installment. Following the grave decimation left by the will of Thanos, the last of the Avengers are left to lament over their losses and failure to protect the universe. With their remaining allies, and a few new ones as well, they devise an elaborate, last-ditch scheme vowing to do whatever it takes to restore the world as they once knew it. Well-crafted, often intensely emotional story is much different in style and in tone than its immediate predecessor, and though the pace lags at times when it gets caught up in the necessary plot jabber (which may raise more questions than answers) it unfolds in ways you wouldn't quite expect with slick, clever twists and in-jokes, wonderful lines, moments of true nostalgia and heroism that pay tribute to the many characters that dedicated followers have come to love over the years. Doesn't quite capture that frantic, ongoing sense of urgency that Infinity War did, but it's rewarding nonetheless, with a smashing and unforgettable finale for series fans. ***",
Emotional and very heartwarming film,24 April 2019,This movie is very emotional and funny at the same time. We can see how much the characters have developed from the start of the MCU. I'm little dissapointed with the lack of fighting scenes and with the ending. I can say what scenes will make great memes. Thank you Marvel for this great period in my life and for all the great movies u created. Keep going on. P.s. Thanos in that garden reminded me of Shrek.,8

Action packed with humour and emotional rollercoaster,24 April 2019,"Endgame ends the entire MCU, 22 movies and nearly spanning 11 years. The directors had a very clear vision in their mind on how to conclude this avengers and bring on the next set of Avengers. Its one of the best and unexpected way. The movie answers all our questions which snapped in Infinity War. More than you expected. Bt one thing, every MCU fan will come out of the cinema with satisfaction and disappointment (cuz Infinity Saga ends). Kudos to all the cast and crew, their hardwork really paid off. The endgame is one thrilling ride of disappointment which in the end , even if you're disappointed you'll be happy. Enjoy it by yourself rather than hearing from others.",10
Overhyped,25 April 2019,"I have watched and enjoyed all the movies leading up to this one, over the past decade, however I left slightly disappointed with Endgame.

Personally, I thought it didn't live up to the hype.

I was particularly disappointed with Captain Marvel's screen-time, given the power she possesses.",7
Terribly painful,28 April 2019,"I honestly don't understand what people liked in this movie. There was too much inspiration from a third class chick flick, with completely useless emotional scenes from super heros who don't really inspire any emotions.

3 hours of boring plot.,28 April 2019,,
MY VERY PERSONAL OPINION,11 October 2020,"It s totally ok if you consider it amazing but for me it is not ..... the last 30 min were pretty nice but ... how about the rest 150 min? It went too fast without any sense... the characters like Thor and Hulk got to childy for no reason.... Why the Jack was it necessary to add fricking Fortnite on it..... Too much political right for my taste..... It is a good movie but FOR ME it is not like Inception, The Prestige and others ( im a Nolan fan ) .",7
They did the Avengers franchise serious justice with this finale. Perfect. End. That still leaves you speechless throughout its entirety.,24 April 2019,"The entire cinema, even the annoying little kids that clearly should not have been there on the first day lol- gasped, laughed, cried throughout the entire film. It was insane, it was emotional, it was gripping, it was sentimental, it was EPIC and it was PERFECT. I am so completely and utterly satisfied.

I have just no words for Endgame, I watched it 12 hours ago and am still processing that sheer brilliance. I have already planned my Round 2 watch! It deserves more than 10 stars, Russo Brothers' did an amazing job at balancing this movie with just about everything that it needed and left nothing to imagination.

I am a huge bollywood stan and am used to 3 hour feature-length films, but Endgame had me looking at my phone in what felt like only an hour...but in fact 2.5 hours had already passed!!!",10

3 hours,5 May 2019,This movie sucked. All they did was flashback to the other movies when you think about it. But everybody loves it. I didn't realize it was going to be a time travel movie like x men which was garbage too. All this was is to reboot some of the characters. Ok maybe most of them. I'm glad I only paid 5 dollars to get in to see it.,
Crazy fun,3 August 2019,"This movie is fun. Nerding out about the massive 23 film undertaking is fun. The storyline is fun. The character evolutions are fun.

Such a waste of time, ressources and such a stamp on Marvel.

Bad, just bad.",1
The Endgame of my life,23 September 2021,"This movie isn't perfect. But i feel like Endgame is actually pretty amazing because it has more characters than any other movie and somehow manages to give a conclusive ending to all of them along with 11 years of the Infinity saga.

The Portals scene means so much to me and billions across the world, a conclusion to everything we love and I'd never have it any other way.",9
It was perfect.,24 April 2019,,10
Some (vague-ish) thoughts on the most anticipated film of the year.,24 April 2019,"Q: Can you review this film without spoiling anything? A: Not really, sorry.

Q: Well can you answer a few questions about it without spoiling anything? A: Sure

Q: Was it good? A: Yes. Very good.

Q: Did it feel like 3 hours? A: No... even though it was fairly leisurely paced for about the first hour or so, I never felt bored or restless.

Q: Did it meet expectations? A: More or less- and they were high to begin with.

Q: How necessary is it to watch the previous Marvel movies before this one? A: Very. This has the most call-backs to the previous MCU movies out of any so far, which is fitting given that it's an ""ending"" of sorts to the previous 20 or so movies.

Q: Did you cry? A: No, but I'm jaded and wouldn't be surprised if other people did.

Q: Did you laugh? A: Yeah it was pretty funny, without sacrificing the more serious stuff. Similar to how the humour was handled in Infinity War.

Q: Speaking of Infinity War, was it better than Endgame? A: I dunno, hard to say right now. They're both about on the same level for me.

Q: How was the Stan Lee cameo? A: A bit rubbish to be honest, especially if this is to be his last.

Q: You gonna keep watching these Marvel movies after this one? A: Probably. If this is the last one I ever saw I think I could live with that. But if there are still interesting stories to tell and talented filmmakers who want to make them, then I'll be there.",9
I Will always love you 3000,8 June 2019,Its the end of a era. A big goodbye. A rear Will fall and u Will leave the movie behind and stay heartbroken,10
10x better than infinity war,21 July 2019,"End Game holds the same epic scale as Infinity War but with everything the first part lacked. This time around, the Russo's provide a more personal, character driven-tale filled with important character moments that I felt Infinity War severely lacked. As a result, despite the stakes being lower in this instalment, I was 10x more invested in the story and action and I truly worried for our heroes this time round.

Our two main hero's, Cap and Tony, are definitely at their best here, despite their tensions from Civil war being brushed aside a little too quickly. The two actors are masters of these roles right now and all of their work pays off, with both characters seeing incredibly satisfying ends by the film's climax. Not to mention, other returning hero's also have satisfying, but admittedly controversial arcs, like Banner and Thor (who isn't as interesting as he was in Infinity war, but is still much better than the pre-Ragnarok rendition of the character).

Because of the more personal story, the action feels less noisy and instead more tense and satisfying, with the final battle being by far the best that the series has offered.

While Thanos takes a back seat in this film, he still remains menacing in his moments onscreen and an incredible motivator for our heroes that we've come to love over the years.

Overall, End Game improves every weak aspect of Infinity War, and acts as a perfect conclusion to the Infinity saga.",9
An excellent superhero film with action and emotionaly heavy,12 June 2019,The epic conclusion of Marve's MCU franchise helds with Avengers Endgame which deeply fullfills every desire a marvel fan will want. No.1 in the world,10

Trip Down Memory Lane,27 April 2019,,10
A Great Closing for the Fans,29 April 2019,"Please keep in mind that this score is coming from a person who is NOT a fan and that this is still a generally positive review.

For the first time for me, I must credit the Disney front office, and especially Feige, for pulling off one of the most ambitious projects in film history. It has become clear to me that this entire 22 Marvel movie series beginning with Iron Man was taken very seriously by everyone involved, and while I respect the directors' visions for each movie, having the oversight over the entire Marvel project was what really made the franchise an unprecedented success.

Now that being said, onto the movie itself. I'll avoid spoilers, so I'll just say I came out feeling just whelmed for this movie. Unlike Infinity War, Endgame felt more like the typical Marvel movie to me, and that means for negatives it suffered from some pacing issues for the sake of exposition, its music especially during more lowkey scenes felt uninspired, and emotional scenes felt very subdued due to some directorial choices, whereas Infinity War did a lot to cut fat and, perhaps due to its position being 2nd to last chronologically, had some actual impactful scenes.

For Endgame specifically, there was a ""thing"" about it that also felt very out of place in contrast to what the tone was (if you've seen the movie you'll know what I'm talking about).

But with these negative points in mind, there were some VERY gratifying scenes, both for those Marvel fans (which I didn't care too much about) and for those who understand what kind of expectations this film needed to meet. And because of these scenes and their execution, I didn't feel cheated out of an ending and I can understand why fans would cry.

Congratulations Marvel fans, it's very rare that a fanbase can see their media being remade to still meet their high demands, and I think Marvel has done it for you guys.

Just please keep discussion open though. Just because someone doesn't feel as strongly as you do does not mean they disrespect your opinion; some people enjoy asking the tough questions to get to a deeper truth.",6

This gives a perfect and tearful farewell to some of our superheroes.,8 August 2021,"Avengers: Endgame is an action, Sci-fi, superhero movie directed by Anthony Russo and Jeo Russo with screenplay by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely and stars an ensemble cast from almost all the previous MCU movies.

This is the 22nd MCU movie.

In my opinion this could be called as the perfect ending of Avengers series and we might not see some characters in the future MCU movies which also includes one of my Favorite character Robert 'Iron-man' Downey Jr.

The movie stars from where the Infinity war has ended and gives a perfect closure. The screenplay of the movie is written and executed beautifully and despite of the length of the movie, the movie will keep you engaged, the best part of the movie is that the movie will not make you feel about the length.

Acting is great and all the characters were best in their respective roles. The movie had provided enough opportunity to everyone to showcase their talent despite of such a huge Star cast. The climax of the movie gives a perfect closure.

Overall a great movie to watch and gives a perfect ending to the avengers series. A must watch for every avenger fan.",10

unbelievable movie,9 December 2023,"When you come to watch this film, you might think that The Avengers is one of those films that you don't like or seem ordinary and the same as other films. But it's very different when you come to the cinema then you see this show. This is extraordinary and maybe this is a film that will win many Oscar awards this year.

Captain Marvel and Thanos give great and extraordinary performances to fans of sci-fi films like Avengers. They fought great and the performance of Thanos and his friends hypnotized everyone who watched it. But there is a funny part where Thanos almost loses at that moment. Thank you, I reviewed this film very happily after watching it.",6

The movie was OK or just good as a standalone.,1 May 2019,"If you are a Marvel fanatic,watched all the movies and were actually looking for a culmination,You must have enjoyed it a whole lot. But as a standalone,this movie was not at all worth it. Considering all the hype and marketing,this movie was boring. Way too long and was tedious in the first half. It picked up in the second half but wasn't enough to compensate,It relied way too much on humour and the progression was painfully slow.

It includes everything: development of already great Characters, spectacular action and incredible effects, humour, happiness, sadness - honestly, what more can you ask.

Really don't know how they can possibly top this - up there with the very best of Action films, like Raiders.....",10
A 2010's Classic,6 July 2021,This is my favorite film of all time better than the lord of the rings star wars e.t jurassic park and titanic for me PERIOD.,10
Best Movie EVER,12 May 2019,I didn't even realize three hours have passed until the movie ended. Best movie I've ever seen.,10
STUNNING and SPEECHLESS,24 April 2019,"Absolutely mesmerized, stunned, excitement, everything, every detail is perfect, this is the movie yet deserved to be rated on top.",10
Not as good as IW,5 March 2022,,7
OMG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,27 April 2019,,10
Introducing time travel was a bad idea in my opinion.,17 June 2020,,6
THE WORST MOVIE,26 April 2019,,1
"The ""Stairway to Heaven"" of superhero movies!",26 April 2019,"It builds from a haunting melancholy tune to a thundering, iron-willed anthem for everything that's great about MCU and comic books in general. Twists, turns, surprises, tears, smiles and memories.. as close to a perfect conclusion to ""Infinity War"" one could hope!",10
It's very awesome movie,9 February 2020,Those are said spoiler review for this movie i think they are opposite to Marvel's. May be they will DC side,10
Amazing,28 April 2021,"One of the best movie I ever watched.

A must watch for all the Marvel fans. Full of action & emotions.",9
SUPERB,24 April 2019,"In many of the battles in the MCU movie, End Game is the most thrilling.",9
One of the best comicbook movies out there.,19 September 2019,"This movie plays with your emotions if you have been keeping track with the MCU. If you haven't, don't watch this movie. This movie isn't for you. But if you have, this movie will blow your mind. It's epic, it's big and a feast to your eyes. It's not one of your typical comicbook movies. It has real stakes and the visuals are stunning. It has flaws of course, like some characters could've been handled better. But I think it's one of the best comicbook movies ever. The visuals, the storytelling, the stakes, the characters, it's just amazing.",10
Epic!,2 September 2020,If you love Avengers and Marvel movies you'll love this to bits. It's an epic story that never seems too long or anything like that. It's just a good watch.,8
Great movie but not epic like infinity war,25 April 2019,Just it it was great movie but there were weakness in the story no character development,7
Amazing,30 April 2019,,10
Perfect conclusion and brilliant movie,28 April 2019,,6
The movie is a joke,8 May 2019,It looked like a cartoon movie. I think the director showcased in the movie whatever he saw in his dream.,1
Epic and sweet,29 April 2019,Although a huge movie it still made time for small character work and conclusions to the smallest of details left in the MCU. A perfect finish!,10
Best one yet,29 April 2019,Love the direction Marvel is taking. Each movie getting better and better,10
Went Out With a Bang!,2 June 2021,"Now, I know I'm not a movie critic but I can tell you that this movie definitely does it's job. Endgame was one of my fave movies definitely and it succeeded and I like seeing this franchise succeeded. Though at some times the writing did get a little repetitive onto infinity war it still did it's job and provided. Also someone tell the producers fortnite isn't a good game! The deaths are extremely sad. Cried only on the one though aka the girl death! Honestly great movie great wrap up. This franchise deserves so many movies to come!",9
Best MCU Film Ever!!!,9 June 2021,"I don,t care what anybody else thinks about this film. It is one hundred percent worth watching and I would highly recommend this film to any Marvel fan.",10
Cinema is so beautiful ...,1 September 2020,"Since 2008, films not only from Marvel, but also from adaptations of comics in general, have been redefined. Marvel was just a second division DC (and a lot more childlike as well) until it released the movie: Iron Man (2008) so yes, Marvel humiliated this unsightly brand of comics, and there began the best film franchise ever made in Cinema's history.

The universe was developing focusing on the development of each character, the studies and character arcs in each film are masterpieces in themselves, but the films themselves were even better. Each film was more fantastic than the other, the ""worst"" film in the saga in my opinion, The Incredible Hulk (2008) is still excellence in its most efficient and graceful form. It's a cinematic orgasm to watch anything from the MCU, but when we put the pieces together and complete the puzzle ...

The Avengers, 2012. The pinnacle of art cinema, the epitome of quality in cinema, a film that was truly good as hell and was marked as a landmark that will remain forever in our hearts. Watching something as surprisingly good as that unbelievably good movie complements totally truly laute of everything that makes a movie really very capable of dissenting the emotions of the human condition so good to be good. Who doesn't remember watching that more than perfect movie in 2012? What a movie ... It brought together everything the MCU had already done well, put together and did the impossible task of overcoming! There are no words that describe the masterpiece that is The Avengers. There are many things to be written here, but the review is not even for this film.

From there, several other excellent films were released, including Civil War and Winter Soldier. Of course, they were really GREAT, but not as perfect as Avengers.

Since everything is going this way, Marvel was risky and decided to give a part of the conclusion of this epic and magnificent story. They wanted to make an adaptation of the Infinity War comics, which could have been bad. But Marvel being Marvel, never lets them down.

Infinity War was not only the best film of 2018, but also a great candidate for the best film ever made in history. A voracity so much better done than anything, that it becomes incomparably the best in history. I don't know where Marvel gets its infinite quality, but for God's sake ... This movie was really the best, masterpiece in a way that no movie seems to even have a chance to be at least something close to something as indescribable and hugely exciting as IW. Was the intuition to make a perfect film? They did it, definitely. Divisor of waters in the genre, and put The Dark Knight to suck. WOW.

But Endgame? Don't get me wrong guys, but which movie was better than Endgame? It's so sad and weepy, Endgame is the best movie ever made, and NOTHING will be better. There, i said it. A tremendously spectacular film and cathedral where all scenes work like Endgame, not winning an Oscar was a big joke. How is a totally ridiculous movie like Joker better than that? Who is Joker near Endgame? Not even the Gods of Cinema can do something as good as that. It is not only the film of the century, but also of history. The time we are all stunned by this masterpiece of art. Better than all books, if you understand. I love it so much, and I'm glad my favorite movie is the best in history. Endgame is flawless, it's the best cinematic experience I've ever had, it's stronger, brighter, more agile and smarter than other films. This movie is worth gold. Godfather? Citizen Kane? Vertigo? Seven Samurai? No, Endgame. This film is an opera. Best of all, always.",10
Not superheroes movie,27 April 2019,"What I saw is bunch of human warriors which each has special skill and ability and fight for what believed as right path. Superheroes don't joke, cry or get desperate. Superheroes don't reject any call for helps. Superheroes don't do silly things. They do. They are all human. A super kind human, with huge hearts. At the end that is what I get.

Both directors very well done bringing up a new thing, joining the heroic plot, whilst it is superhero movie we believed filled by tons of tough guys, and not anymore, every single one is vulnerable.

Thank you everyone, in producing this movie. It is a bad news for any superhero movies coming up next, though. Both from MCU or DCEU. One heavy standard has been stamped.",10
It was ok....,13 November 2019,"Maybe I'm a bit over the whole ""let's get all the superheroes together in one room"" genre.",7
The Best Marvel film yet,29 May 2019,,10
A very good conclusion to the MCU but Infinity Wars was a much better movie,25 April 2019,,7
Overhyped,6 May 2019,"Has a lot of plotholes, but I still enjoyed it. However, the rating should be lowered to atleast 7 so im giving it 1 to balance it out, as all things should be.",1
Best Visual Effects,5 October 2021,"Best movie ever watched in Cinema, Tihs movie got action , adventure and emotions which makes it perfect for a family to watch.",10
Masterpiece,24 April 2019,"10/10 Action,Happiness,Sadness and pure joy! I laughed , cried and was speechless. 3 hours well used. It was a perfect ""ending"" of the Avenger Movies. I will watch it again and again and again. Love 3000",10

Great Movie. End exactly like what you expected!,24 April 2019,"Great story telling with heaps of humor, make this movie very enjoyable. i think its the most enjoyable marvel movie after infinity wars. bit tears too t.t",10
EPIC,12 May 2019,The only complaint about Avengers: Endgame is that it raises the bar so high that there may well never be a superhero movie to match it.,8
"Without Stan, the movies start to lose their magic",25 April 2019,"I believe many of those who are giving top scores to the movie are still feeding on the hype. Yes, it was extreme and yes I was more than excited to be a part of it as a MCU fan from the start. Saw the first screening in my country and booked tickets immediately after they were released for sale.

The movie is not Infinity War part 2... It is different. The pace between drama, comedy and action moments isn't so well entwined in the timeline. Even the CGI isn't so good and the majority of the movie is too dark.

I keep having the feeling that the Russos wanted to make sure the movie strayed away from the most popular fan theories, and I would even suspect the reshoots at the end of last year were to edit some plot points that were too widely guessed.

The result, however, is the most incoherent MCU movie from them by far. Ever since Winter Soldier they have managed to build strong and emotional powerhouses, but as it stands Infinity War will be their peak, and not Endgame.

I am sure every fan out there will watch the movie. Many will watch it more than once looking for all the easter eggs in it (there are such). But the reality is I left the cinema wondering if I saw the real movie. I keep having the feeling this was a troll release by the Russos, and a voice in my head keeps wondering if we will ever get to see the real release. I know there is no such thing, but I kind of wish there was.",7
the movie was MORE than EPIC,30 April 2019,"A movie full of action, drama, superhero moments and many many more... This movie can NOT be topped! For me it had everything we need... and more!!! Captain america and Iron man get finaly what they diserved!! Everyone in this movie has their shinning moment!!! In this movie i cried, i laughed, i screamed and i was going CRAZY!!! It had the right amount of drama in the begging (maybe a little bit more). The drama for me was necessary, because our heroes need to realise that they lost and that half of the entire universe has dissapeared!!! If you thought that infinity war was an epic movie wait till you see this one!!! WOW!!! I can not explain to you what i see i can not explain how epic this movie was!! you just need to go and see it! THANK YOU STAN LEE THANK YOU KEVIN FEIGE THANK YOY RUSSSO BROTHERS AND THANK YOU MARVEL FOR THIS AMAZINNG AND EPIC 11 YEARS!!!!",10
Great time pass,18 April 2020,A good movie with not much to go looking for. Great special effects. Great acting. Bad scripting.(both the story and dialogues) Amazing screenplay and editing. Had higher expectations,6
The worse Avengers of them all !,7 June 2019,It was extremely disappointing. Crammed every politically correct them down your throat.,1
Cried watching Avenger? Really!,8 May 2019,"Who would have ever thought one could cry watching Avengers? I'm not saying that I did or did I?..... but many people did. Endgame is the most emotional one of all. I couldn't get enough of it. So, I'm going for another round tomorrow. Who knows, I might go for another after that too.",10
Un sueño hecho realidad para los fans de Marvel,24 April 2019,Tiene momentos para saltar de la butaca. Pelicula para ver 2 y 3 veces sin problema.,10
Perfect!,29 May 2019,"Going into the movie with high hopes, came out astonished, kudos to the people making this movie a wonderful thing!",10
what ever it takes,24 April 2019,This end game super super dont spoiler please sit and watch the end game,10
Holy... &%*$,24 April 2019,"Keeping this spoiler free which means I can't really say much about anything. If I could sum it up, it would be... however prepared you think you are for what's coming, you're not even close. But it is blockbuster cinema at it's finest.

The story and the characters are faultless. It's funny as hell, particularly the first half. The action may lack but that's because this is a movie about the characters and the journey that's brought them all this way. It's probably the closest a blockbuster will successfully come close to an indie drama.

The 3 hour run time does wonders, giving the movie, it's plot and it's actors and it's directors room to get very creative and pace it's emotional arks and it's complex story.

If there are flaws, it's in the fan service, which runs extremely high (too great and small effect), causing some logic to wane and an inconsistent tone during important moments. Characters are shorthanded but if you expect anything less, you're expecting a 10 hour mini-series, not a single movie (3 hours or not).

Given the scale, this is actually very well structured and entirely, emotionally walloping. Not just because of the 11 years of movies that came before it (though that helps). There won't another quite like it for some time.",9

Solid enough but I feel infinity war set them up to be better than this movie,26 January 2022,,6
Awwesome,14 August 2020,"Simply Awesome movie, nice character execution... amazing CGI.",9
Ho and hum.......,30 April 2019,"Well, they definitely threw everything into this movie including the kitchen sink. And they worked hard to give all of the characters sufficient screen time. I definitely feel as though I got my money's worth. There wasn't a boring moment in the movie and it didn't feel like a 3 hour movie. There's lots of action and lots of laughs. However, less would have been more. Or maybe it's that I am not used to seeing a movie in a crowded theater.",7
2 hours of boring 1 battle Glad I didn't pay full price,16 May 2019,,3
BEST FILM OF 2019,4 February 2020,"Robert Downey Jr, Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlet Johanson and Josh Brolin were stunning so as the rest others.

Please don't die if you haven't watched it yet. But in order to watch this, you have to make sure that you have watched the rest other films of MCU. This is an epic conclusion to the 20 films.",10

Great,29 April 2019,"What a movie, highly recommend for everyone to watch it.",10
Extremely overrated,3 August 2019,"Between the hype , expectations and the facts .. i can -with a clear consciousness - call this an extremely overrated movie ..",8
Appreciate this film.,7 July 2021,Avengers end game is excellent film I watched after long time.,8
Good movie but disappointment,26 April 2019,"So I just watch endgame last night the movie it self was actually pretty good. But the things we hoped to see happen that should have happen and things that definitely happened at some points shouldn't. For myself everything I wanted see happen, I guess you could say did but not in the ways myself and probably most fans wanted to see. hoping to see all the redemptions for certain characters from Infinity war didn't really happen in the most satisfying way, I'm trying very hard not to spoil anything for anybody so I'm trying to be very vague with what I'm trying to say some characteristics gets redemptions from the first movie but I feel like it was here do this quickly so we can move on to another scene definitely could have wrapped up in Less than 3 hours.I will say this though in the last half of the movie was probably the most satisfying visually but once it got to the end. I feel like it was hurry this up and get it over with my opinion. So don't base your feelings upon Avengers endgame on what I'm saying here everyone looks at it differently. So this is just my Outlook on it, everyone is going to have a different one.thanks",7
Marvel lost it,24 August 2019,,8
Very average movie,2 August 2019,How on earth did this average kind of movie managed to beat the AVATAR !!!!!!!,6
Is this movie from the same guys who made The Last Jedi??,7 May 2019,,1
Marvel at its best!,29 April 2019,"Avengers: Endgame is an apotheosis, full of surprises, but I'll tell nothing, the Marvel policy has to be respected: spoilers are prohibited! What I saw was different from my expectations, but good surprises! The Marvel movies are not just films, they are more than that, but I don't figure out the right word. Avengers: Endgame is an epilogue like nothing similar! Go and watch it!",10
One of the greatest movie-going experiences ever... and the perfect end to a larger than life saga,26 April 2019,,10
"When the story lasts long enough, it is true and authentic and real.",24 April 2019,"I thought this is the kind of movie that we forget real soon even if we burst into tears while watching it. I thought this is a movie based on comics without so much great meanings. I was 100 percent wrong. Every character, every person is something. It was a story since 2008 and it has been told for 11 years. I didn't expect it to end now but now that I've watched it, every second of the movie is worth it. It is in the form of a story, but it is real. In some universe, this is happening and that universe is living prosper with a happy ending. Or, did it really end?",10
THIS MOVIE MADE ME CRY!!! BEST MARVEL MOVIE EVER,4 May 2019,I thought the whole plot of the movie was gonna be different but once I saw the movie it completely just blew my mind. MARVEL CAN NOT MAKE A BETTER MOVIE THEN ENDGAME. They just can't. Endgame will always be Thea best. 10/10,10
Lit,28 April 2019,This is too good Damn this is too good Damn i like this movie Omg capt america,10
"A big fat, worthy ending",24 April 2019,Just got out of the theatre. Awesome movie! Weaves up the threads into a big fat huge ending. Plenty surprises in there. A huge amount of beyond entertaining scenes. And the scale of it is EPIC. Oh my God of thunder. Pay offs and priceless moments.,10
The ruin him,28 April 2019,,6
Haters gonna hate no matter what!,27 April 2019,"First of all the movie was great. There is absolutely no doubt about that. I agree that time travel was tricky and difficult to understand. But people comparing this with infinity war are just too dumb. It was a brilliant effort landing something like this, it took a lot of patience and genius to pull this off. But some people are over smart trying to notice all those little plot holes neglecting the overall satisfaction it gave to the Audience. It was pure fangasm and it could not have been better. People only like infinity war more because it has too many battle scenes.",10
Over-Rated,23 May 2019,"It's a great movie, though. But it is over-rated. The first hour is sleepy and boring. And the final battle isn't as sensational as Infinity War.",7
Way Overhyped,18 August 2019,"It's hard to believe that this is the highest grossing movie of all time. It's not even that good of a Marvel movie.

I understand that this is based on a comic book characters but damn! The fact that this movie is so successful is pretty much the reason why Hollywood thinks they can get away making movies that aren't all that well thought out but look cool. The first hour was downright painful to get through and if they had taken out a lot of the unnecessary crap, this movie easily could have been 2 hours long.",2
A beautiful ending,22 June 2019,"I will not call it a fitting ending.. but it was definitely beautiful. The movie ensures that every character is given enough space, but not too much. The ending battle is epic! But what stole my heart was the credits. It's a must watch for the franchisee fans.",9
Near perfect cinematic experience!,7 August 2019,,9
Intense!!!,25 October 2020,The fight scene was epic! I had to rewatch it over and over!,10
"A masterpiece! Every feeling in this movie- Fun, Seriousness, Sadness and Action.",7 August 2021,Mind blowing movie I mean it was so good that we gave it a standing ovation. One of my favorite and Marvel has done a great job. Most people think Marvel is childish but it is actually a nice movie for all generations. You won't regret to watch it and it will 100% make a smile on your face.,10

I loved it,11 March 2021,"It was the most popular movie in the world for quite some time. Cinemas choke full with people wanting to see what this was all about. I avoided all spoilers and watched it on the third night of release. I was blown away, by the amount of plot twists and possible Easter eggs I had found, another thing was that it was so interesting, that I found myself glued to my seat. All in all it was a beautiful movie and I loved it.",10
Average and lengthy,6 May 2019,"This movie is better than the previous one, infinity war. Worth a watch as an entertaining movie, but I'm not impressed or have anything to remember",6
Lost for words,31 May 2019,What a way for Phase 3 to end. Its crazy that you have waited so long for the movie that you have waited for all your life.,10
"A good ending, but doesn't stand on it's own",26 April 2019,"The movie wraps up the series nicely, but as with many finales the movie doesn't really stand in it's own until half way through.

The first half is wrapping up all that happened before, and a lot has happened to so many different strong and complex characters. The hour and a half it takes to reach the real 'end game' feels both a bit shallow, and slow.

All in all, the movie does what it promises, end the series, but for those who are not die hard fans, might find the end result a bit uninspired and dutiful.",6
Very disappointed,24 April 2019,I was thinking it's gonna the perfect cbm movie of all time it's a big disappointment it's really bad a big mess of events and characters jumping in middle of the another one it's worst then josstice league,1

Avengers: Endgame Review,10 July 2019,"I 100% didn't feel that this movie is 3h long, Though this will be good to watch at home, Endgame is one of those movies that was made to be a cinema experience, in 3D or not (but it was better in 3D). I believe in most of the developments and paths the characters chose. For a movie with so many characters and converging plots, Endgame doesn't feel too packed.",9
Childhood coming to Life,5 February 2021,"If you want, you can certainly find several weaknesses in this film. But why spoil the fun? As someone who, as a child, flicked through the superhero comics with big eyes, this film is a childhood that has come to life. Sure, it's a bit overloaded, but it always remains surprising, it's an emotional conclusion and, above all, a film for the fans, which became clear when half the hall jumps out of its seats and shouts ""Assemble"". And for that I say thank you!",9
A movie that's gonna live forever!,13 February 2021,"So, when i just looked in here for viewing the ratings, all i ever saw was 1 rating. I don't know what's the matter with the haters and i never will. And honestly, i don't care. I just wanted to say it.

Now about the movie, it was a masterpiece in many ways. First of all, the performances, the ensemble cast. It was a beauty. Then Silvestri's music. The story, the pacing, the humour. Then the emotional depth, RDJ's acting.

Everything was right about movie. The cliffhanger of Mjolnir wielding was exceptional. I loved it. I always will.",10
"loved movie, will see it in theater again and buy the DVD",16 July 2019,"So much to see here, lots going on. First movie in years where I did not allow myself a 5 minute potty break. amazing and original and impactful. the best!",9

Made Me A True Fan,11 June 2019,My boyfriend truly loves anything Marvel. I would usually pass on watching any robot or superhero movie but I had the chance to watch Infinity Wars. OMG! I was hooked and so we went to see Endgame. I have now doubled back to watch all of the prior films I missed so I understand each character. I am now a true fan of Marvel.

"If this series is ranked internally, the best one is the first.",26 April 2019,"Some people compare the Avengers series with the Star Wars series and the Lord of the Rings series. I don't know where the comparison is. Not to mention that the Star Wars and the Lord of the Rings are of the movie history level, at least in one sense, none of the Star Wars and the Lord of the Rings series is a single movie about a single character. Their films have many characters, but what they produce can be called epics. Films like Star Wars and Lord of the Rings are enduring classics and will be model textbooks for many years to come. So which Marvel movie is worthy of the word ""classic""? Over the past 11 years, I have followed the footsteps of Superhero movie. I have seen all the Marvel movies shown in the cinema. I can only say that I am worthy of myself. But if one only talks about feelings when evaluating a movie, what are the other values of this movie?",6
Don't believe the hype. Boring movie,29 April 2019,"I was really hoping to watch a good movie. I have seen all Marvel movies and was excited with the 10 star reviews. But this movie is basically garbage. A lot of characters doing random things. There was no interesting story line. The emotional scenes did not have any impact. The action scenes will leave you with a headache. What amazes me is people giving a 10 star, please be honest to yourself and rate correctly.",1
"Amazing, but not 10/10",9 October 2020,"Everyone knows Endgame. I would rate the film as follows

1. Characters 10 2. Acting 10 3. Plot 9 4. Cinematography 10 5. World building 9

We have stellar characters and acting that you could rate 11 with Tony Stark, Spiderman, Thor, Ant man, Captain America, Black Panther but we also have other characters that are more an 8-9 with Rody, Hawkeye, Vision, Scarlet Witch, but overall that's a 10 I have to admit.

However, the plot could be a tiny bit better and the film feels a bit too long, so plot only gets a 9.",9
Is Avengers endgame good?,1 November 2020,"Avengers: Endgame isn't a great movie, but there are flashes of greatness in it, and quite a few of them belong to Evans.

The Perfect Ending,4 November 2020,"Usually in trilogies or more than four sequel movies, we find the ending is bad or not satisfying or at least mediocre not like the first of them. we have a universe and a bunch of movies that were planned all along 10 years and we got a conclusion one of the best i've ever seen in my entire life, not because of acting skills or the astounding visual effects but for the planning of this story only. Kevin Feige has put a plan and executed it the way he saw from 10 years far a way. like breaking bad, VinceGilligan has known how his story is going to end. Not all movies are perfect, but at least they knew what their abilities are and put all their efforts in it, and for that I raise my hat for them. Thank you Marvel.",10
One Observation...,16 October 2020,"I can't add much here that the other 9,000 people who have reviewed it haven't covered. Just a funny observation I've had upon repeat viewings.

It's funny how prescient the scene with the Russo brother giving in therapy is, for fans of this movie. You know, the one where he's talking with Steve Rogers about his date? ""He started to cry as they were bringing out the salads."" ""What about you?"" ""I... cried as they were bringing out dessert.""

This is pretty much how EVERY... SINGLE... CONVERSATION about this movie goes with people I know.

""He cried when the CGI raccoon held the blue lady's hand."" ""What about you?"" ""I... cried when a hammer deemed a fat man still worthy.""

That a movie could make be lose track of how many times I got misty eyed or downright weepy, BEFORE the final half hour where it was non-stop tears of all varieties (joy, sorrow, grief, sheer admiration of your childhood being put on an IMAX screen in full glory, etc, etc)... that really speaks to how emotionally impactful and Incredible such a film is. EVERYBODY I talk with had at least one scene that made them cry; how often does a movie do that with any audience, much less one as diverse as this one had?",10

The Right Ending,12 June 2019,The perfect ending to a series. I left the theater wanting it not to end even know it answered all questions and closed the series off.,10
Fun and interesting twist of characters,27 April 2019,Fun movie to watch and interesting twist of characters they did with Thor and Hulk. But not worthy of 9/10 ... It's just a fictional superhero movie.,7
Waste of money,11 May 2019,"So dissappointed. Was expecting a blast of a film. Cutting film time down by half hour/hour might have made it better. Only the last hour was ok, but expected much more with that also. Storyline not great either. Previous Avengers films much better. Such a shame. Waste of money really. Expectation I guess has earned its box office takings.",3
A worthy ending...,4 January 2021,"I avoided seeing this movie for the longest time. I just watched it - Jan 3, 2021.

I have to say they did a very nice job. Fitting in aspects from all previous movies nicely. Excellent acting from everyone. You could tell how many of these actors really clicked over the previous movies as the chemistry was really nice here.

I was surprised how many emotional scenes there were. If you were a fan of the previous movies you will enjoy this.

The ending battle scene is absolutely awesome. It's exactly the type of comic book grand finale/battle you would expect.

A truly worthy ending to fantastic story.",9
Brilliant,27 February 2021,,10

Absolutely perfect,1 June 2021,"Really nice film.

I suggest to see this film after watching the previous movie of the mcu. It's a great film anyway but without the other movies you can't fully understand the story.

It's full of action scenes and the special effect are crazy.",10
Perfect conclusion too an amazing journey,7 May 2019,"This is the movie us fans have been waiting too watch for a very long time, with much anticipation this film delivers on almost all of our dreams and much more, with unexpected turns and call backs that make being part of the 11 year journey so much more rewarding. This movie is what fans have wanted but I must warn of you haven't seen any of the movies before this, then it's probably not a good Idea to watch.",10
This could be the beginning of the end for marvel,24 April 2019,"There were some good points but there were also some very average and predictable points.

"An Emotional, Ambitious, and Flawed Ending to a Glorious Group of Movies.",27 April 2019,"Overall, I'm very satisfied with this movie. It was incredibly ambitious, taking risks that I didn't think it could possibly take. It was also obviously emotional being that this is a goodbye to some characters and a huge story line that has been set up since 2008. This movie also has the most epic final battle that I've seen in any movie, and anybody who sits through that wont be disappointed.

With that being said, this movie definitely has some pacing problems. There were some moments that kind of lagged. And while this movie takes some risks, not all of them pay off. To be honest, some of the risks this movie took with the plot kind of left me a little confused., but the good out ways the bad and we've gotten a very satisfying conclusion to an incredible group of movies.",7

Definitely an epic finale unlike anything else,7 May 2019,,8
Amazing follow up to the mediocre Infinity War,28 September 2021,"Avengers: Infinity War was a pretty mediocre film, all things considered. It suffered heavily from overload (too many characters and plot-lines) but Avengers: Endgame ties things up really well. So well, in fact, that I've watched the film three times now and I'd be up for watching it again sometime in the future.

You've got humor, strong emotional pieces, a much-appreciated smaller cast of characters and an absolutely fantastic final act.

Avengers: Endgame is simply the gold-standard for the MCU.",10
An Epic semi-Ending to an Epic Franchise,24 April 2019,"If there's also any single phrase that sums up the guiding principle of the Marvel Cinematic Universe it's this: Hold that thought. (Truth be told, with Endgame's running time of three hours, ""hold that bladder"" would also apply.)

But the bottom line is that it's as hilarious as mush as it is Heartbreaking.

It's helpful, before going to see Endgame, to cast your mind back to the contradictory feelings of that final scene. This one focuses on the efforts of Cap and the remaining Avengers to implement a do-over - essentially rewinding the effects of Thanos' snap - feels at once sad and deeply satisfying, complicated and surprisingly comic. If many of us have grown up with the MCU, the films themselves have also grown more complex, like a fine wine.

In a sense, Endgame is an example of the MCU cannibalizing itself, but it has always done so. And it does so here in a fresh way that is closer to homage than lazy appropriation. These affectionate flashbacks also serve as a tip of the hat to all the loyal fans who have held this sprawling mythology so dear.

Spoiler Alert? Sure! THOR IS FAT!!!

As high as the stakes are in Endgame, it is also a very funny movie. The humor of the story - some of which takes place in the future, five years after the end of ""Infinity War"" - has to do with surprising ways in which the lives of certain characters have changed (along with their personalities and, in some cases, their physiques). If Infinity War was about failure, Endgame is, ironically, all about acceptance and moving on. After 11 long years, the Infinity Saga is finally, fulfillingly over.

There is no post-credit scene. But oh, what a going-away party these old friends have thrown for themselves. You'd certainly be in more tears then you were during Infinity war's climax. Tears of joy for most, that is.",10
Danvers Ex Machina,29 June 2024,"After what feels like all the hype in the world and five whole years of time, Endgame couldn't possibly hope to match it, but I was hugely into the breathlessly relentless Infinity War so I was cautiously hopefully for this. As a sequel to that film, it's a very poor one, and is crammed full of illogical half-thoughts and foolish asides. The fat Thor stuff is going to age appallingly and the clunky lampshading of time travel tropes doesn't forgive the heavy-handedness of it all. However as a relatively functional conclusion to over a decade of cinematic storytelling it's pretty impressive. A mixed bag, but things this enormous are rarely satisfying in of themselves, and it's less of an enjoyable film and more of ... well ... a marvel.",6

An epic culmination of 10 years of incredible film-making!,4 August 2019,"As a Marvel fan I had my hopes up at 100% for this film being so invested throughout the years with the characters and their stories and I gotta say I was not disappointed at all!

This is the only film I've seen in theaters more than once and for great reasons, it truly doesn't disappoint. This and Infinity War were the only films where I physically automatically jumped out of my seat when something epic would happen and the callbacks to other movies were fan-service to the max!

The plot is ridiculous in its premise and does require more suspension of disbelief than all of the other Marvel movies that came before this one and it executes it's the plot perfectly with enough high-stakes and humor to be a fully immersive experience.

This truly is a once in a lifetime film event and is the perfect ending to a near-perfect saga.",10

10/10,25 April 2019,"This movie is perfect, it perfectly wraps up the avengers storyline..... it didnt feel like a 10/10 at first but thats because i was used to the typical avengers/marvel movie chain of events. but after looking back on it it was PERFECTLY laid out, the majority of the movie lacks action and fight scenes but thats what it's supposed to be like, its the last time we're going to see some of these characters on screen and they deserve a proper send-off...... but once you get to the end of the film......... that fight sequence... OH... MY... GOD",10
Insanely Good,24 April 2019,All around amazing. A beautiful ending that felt not only like a proper wrap up to everything we have seen in the MCU so far but also opened so many doors for the future. This will be at the top (at least top 3) of everyone's marvel movie rankings.,10
"World was waiting, and world has been delivered.. Excellent",24 April 2019,"Marvel shake the ass of Captain Marvel low, and hit back wildly strong 💪, good god what a Movie, i hope every single person will see the movie... Emotional closure for some, Joyful come back for others, i guarantee you all if seen all MCU movies you will be totally mind blown Enjoy planet earth Thanks MCU very much for it",9
The well deserved conclusion,24 April 2019,"Apart from some cheesy moments, some of them fan pleasing, it was really good. I think it was a solid 10-year wrap up conclusion, so they could start something new (with the new characters Marvel now owns back).

Good humour, comic-like story sequence, paying homage to almost all the old arcs of the heroes tribiting departed and survivors.

Way to many cameos, it was a festival for Marvel. Some of them they did not have a line. They did not need to, to be honest.

All the Infinity war surviving characters were well treated through the whole movie and some of them had satisfying climax and conclusioj to their stories. For some futire is still with many stories to be told.

The actions of act 2 were a bit troubling about the story and the consequences of the future MCU. The visuals were spectacular, especially in the 3rd act.

Compare to Infinity war which was a base story with many concrete plot points, Endgame got his power from IW but went to a way bigger direction, some of it unnecessarily.

The most ""it's a no from me"" scene was the very poorly and stupidly ""girl power superleague"" moment.

Thor was the comic relief character, in many ways.

The aftermath of 'Avengers Endgame' is a bittersweet sensation, eager for more stories.",7
My two cents,3 September 2019,"There was parts where ,because of the screaming in the theater, I couldn't hear myself think. Oh wait that might have been me. At times i found myself thinking ' ten movies ago they knew they were going to bring this or that back,no freaking way. Sometimes covered in goosebumps, sometimes with tears this movie did what i thought couldn't be done It exceeded the expectations By a lot",10

'End Game' Goes Into Extra Innings,28 April 2019,"There is a lot more right with this movie then wrong. Marvel fans will love it. It is too long by about 35 minutes and focuses mostly on the original six Avengers (who after 20 Marvel films are no longer the most exciting of the line up). The battle scenes are amazing but also happen so fast it will all be a blur. (It's meant to be watched more then a few times.) The plot is confusing and Brie Larson (Captain Marvel) is barely in it. (A big over sight as her film was a major box office hit.) Unless you are a fan (and who isn't) you'll want to take a hard pass on this one. Do not watch it in 3D!! The glasses just darken an already gloomy screen image. Not worth it. Otherwise, it's a fun popcorn movie with enough emotional highs and lows to merit the hype surrounding it. Might be best to see it in IMAX or at the drive in.",9
Great!!!,15 May 2019,"It is the best movie in Marvel history i think. First of all, all character's acting was good. I waited endgame so long after the Avengers infinity war. People have high expectation. In infinity war most of heroes and people died. And i tried to predict how died heroes coma back, how they win Thanos, how ending can be. finally i just want to you advice one thing, go to the theater and watch it. You won't regret.",10

"Big Names, Lots of Stars, but just another CGI @#$% Storm",1 January 2022,"Tried to get into it, I was patient with the set up. But, for the most part, it's just another sequence after sequence of CGI action scenes without much substance. It's fun to see all the stars in the same film, but not enough to rescue this release with low art value and high commercial corporate fooder value.",6
Goodbye avengers,11 May 2019,"Endgame was the most hyped film of the season for three reasons. One is the shocking anti climax of infinity war which ends with a cliffhanger. Second it was rumored to be the last film of most of our favorite characters due to various reasons so fans were mentally preparing themselves to see them for the last time and say them goodbye. And last is that the makers remained tightlipped regarding the film which increased the curiosity level of the audience. With all the hype, does endgame meet your expectations? Let's find out.

Positives: The film is divided into three acts. Though the first act is slow its very intense and emotional. The second act was the most entertaining where time travelling is done as it has many funny moments. And the third act was action packed which provide you goosebumps and in end makes you emotional.

Now let's talk about our favorite characters.

1. Iron man: With 3 standalone movies, main lead in all avengers films, second lead in civil war, a cameo in incredible hulk and an extended cameo in homecoming, RDJ kept on earning the love of audience making him the God of MCU. In endgame, he once again win your hearts. Your heartbreaks when you see him skinny and weak in the beginning. He had some heartwarming moments with his daughter and also when he hugs his father while time travelling. And in the end when he snaps saying his epic line ""I am iron man"" and dies he nails a heroic image among audience. Don't know how MCU will be without him. We love you 3000. 2. Captain America: My favorite character in MCU. In 8 years cap's character was constant being a serious, mature and no nonsense Steve Rogers. In first avenger and the avengers everyone felt him as a boring character. But in winter soldier, he proved that he can be badass like James bond and Ethan hunt. In age of ultron he got a bit sidelined whereas though civil war was his film audience saw it as an avengers film. Plus, he earned the wrath of iron man fans for hiding Tony's parents murder and they mocked him saying that if bucky wasn't there then iron man would have killed him in the end. Later in infinity war he got less significance though he was given a great intro. In endgame, he plays a very crucial role who keeps on motivating his friends. And I thank Russo brothers for giving him the most epic scene where he lift Thor's mjolinir. That scene showed what cap is worthy of. And he gets a happy ending where he time travels and goes back to Peggy. Thank you Chris Evans for making Captain America my favorite character. 3. Black widow: though we miss her badass action in endgame she wins our hearts for sacrificing herself for the soul stone. Especially the fight between her and Clint to die for soul stone is tension packed.

Negatives: I can't believe how Russo brothers ruined the character of Thor whose fan following grew leaps and bounds with ragnarok and infinity war making him the second favorite avenger. I understand that he was depressed for not going for the head and it was fine showing him as a fat drunkard but in the end at least he could have given him some elevation. I liked professor hulk but we missed his smash. Also we wanted a rematch of him and thanos. Time travel concept is confusing and compared to infinity war, thanos character was less explored here.

Verdict: On the whole, endgame is a highly entertaining and engaging film despite being for 3 hours. But compared to infinity war it was not that satisfying. It will be a treat for iron man and cap fans. Thank you avengers for entertaining us for 7 years.",9
Popcorn fodder,17 May 2020,"When you commit 3 hours to a Marvel flick, nobody is under the illusion they're watching an Oscar contender. If youre for escapism and a few laughs that's what you get in the MCU, and this instalment doesn't disappoint.",6

Amazing!!!,26 April 2019,,10
The Final Chapter of MCU Will Leave You in Tears With 1000s of Memories !!!,13 March 2022,"Avengers: Endgame' continues from its previous instalment 'Avengers: Infinity War', where a chain of catastrophic events destroyed half the universe. The remaining Avengers now come together for one final time to reverse the actions of the evil Thanos and restore the order of the universe.

Overwhelming. It best describes the final chapter that culminates Marvel Cinematic Universe's 21 iconic films into one. And that also describes the experience of watching your favourite superheroes come together for a singular goal, for one last time. Directors Anthony and Joe Russo ensure that the humongous build-up and the avalanche of expectations do not get the better of them. They deliver a largely wholesome product that is full of moments laced with action, emotion, comedy and drama. Writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely take you along, even if you haven't been following the franchise. They do an incredible job with the screenplay to balance emotions with visual spectacle. So if you're not a fan yet, chances are, you might become one after watching this instalment.

Avengers: Endgame is also several films in one because of how it's meant to serve as a farewell tour for the original gang of six who headlined The Avengers: Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Captain America (Chris Evans), the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner). Since it's the final chapter for most, Avengers: Endgame is naturally built around them, so it can tie up and put a bow on their standalone arcs. And it delivers on most accounts, with a couple of tragic deaths, a dose of wish fulfilment, and even a possible tease of an enticing future. That does mean other characters, War Machine (Don Cheadle), Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) and Rocket (Bradley Cooper), aren't as well-serviced, others like Nebula (Karen Gillan) merely serve the plot, while the likes of Captain Marvel (Brie Larson) barely feature.

While the screen time for each character is not equal, their significance in the story is. And there are enough surprises in store, as far as their fates are concerned. 'Endgame' delivers quite well on the emotional quotient, bringing out superpowers and vulnerabilities of its cinematic demigods through their measured performances. From an upright Captain America (Chris Evans) to a stoic Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and from a straight-faced Captain Marvel (Brie Larson) delivering the punches to the reassuring presence of Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), 'Endgame' has it all and a lot more. Thanks to the conviction in performances, you also might just find yourself rooting for the bad guy, Thanos (Josh Brolin) at some point. However, it's the comic collective of Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) and Ant Man (Paul Rudd) that ensures there are enough lighter moments in this otherwise heartfelt finale.

The action becomes progressively intense, but never overbearing. In fact, it remains relevant and true to the narrative, such that it weaves in enough opportunities for major plot twists that even the diehard fans may not see coming. The extensive CGI work adds to the visual appeal, even in 2D.

In celebrating the past, Avengers: Endgame does more than just help bid goodbye to the original gang, some of whom pass the torch to the next generation before they walk off into the sunset. (After all, Marvel has the future to think of.) It allows the audience to reflect on their own emotions as well, for how the superheroes speak to them about responsibility, teamwork, and love among other things. Avengers: Endgame is the culmination of what is ultimately a blockbuster TV show on the big screen. The MCU is unique in what it has achieved here, and it makes you wonder if Marvel itself, let alone someone else, can create something like this again. For the time being, it leaves diehards with many questions for what's to come and how the universe will proceed after such a seismic event.

For the non-fans, the film's explanatory tone might come across as a speed breaker at times, but for the fans, the same invokes hope and excitement, leading to constant gasps and howls.

Overall, 'Avengers: Endgame' is a befitting tribute to the Cinematic Universe that has spawned larger-than-life superheroes and super fans. At three hours plus, 'Endgame' delivers on a lot of its hallmark promises, leaving its fans with a range of emotions and fond memories.",10
I never thought another film could beat my favourite.,24 May 2019,"For years Alien has been my favourite film of all time and even then I rated it as an 8.

But on the 26th April, I got up in the morning and went to the cinema with I skip in my stride. Wondering how this could possibly top Infinity War.

What I got was the most satisfying and most awesome end to 11 years of amazing story telling.

Leaving the cinema I knew that Avengers: Endgame was the greatest film I'd ever seen in my life and that's where it will stay forever.",10
Pure genius,25 April 2019,"From the opener scene to the final fade to black this is an outstanding way to end the journey - so far - of the Avengers.

Funny, brutal, emotional and thought provoking this has been crafted together by people who really care about the fates of these characters.

Absolutely awesome",10
Truly Perfect,27 April 2019,,10
"Good, but not quite good enough",11 March 2020,"After the spectacular Infinity War, I was expecting a masterpiece to finish off the saga. I was a little disappointed.

Three quarters of Endgame was a nostalgic run through the previous movies. It was entertaining, but eventually I found it a little boring in all honesty. The end battle was predictably exciting but it didn't redeem itself enough for one major flaw...

Where was the Hulk? Aside from a small cameo at the beginning of Infinity War, the character has virtually been written out of the final two movies. Endgame portrays him as almost a new character, with little involvement in any battle scenes. For a character that required such a huge degree of redemption from the prior film, he was almost a secondary thought in this one.

I've watched and rewatched countless times to see if I missed something, but I don't think I have. This was a good movie, it just wasn't as good as it could have been.",7

A cinematic epic for generations to come.,26 April 2019,"With the events that occurred in Avengers: Infinity War (man was that film a riot) it left me speechless and not even knowing what was gonna happen next. So you can obviously assume that I was going into Avengers: Endgame with super high hopes. Probably with more higher hopes than any other theater experience for me. Not only were those hopes granted, but they were exceeded.

Avengers: Endgame really is a film to be seen by all. Not only is it a cinematic epic, you will feel something you've never felt before with any other movie experience. Avengers: Endgame is by far the most epic, emotional, heart-wrenching, and action packed feature that Marvel has ever released. You will have moments have laughter, anger, sadness, hopefulness, etc. All emotions you could think of from watching a movie is all here.

Every character that you've come to know and love gets the right amount of screen time. Each play a part and some even give us some very unexpected surprises, but in a good way. All the actors from Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man to Brie Larson as Captain Marvel give great performances. Some even having their best moments in this movie. Josh Brolin as Thanos will give you chills just as epic as the ones he displayed from Avengers: Infinity War.

The story's got more weight to it than it does from its predecessor. You don't expect how the story will go and which decisions will be made by the characters. This movie gives us many surprises. Definitely some of the best writing a Marvel production has given us.

I just wanna give my highest respects to the directors Joe and Anthony Russo for giving us such a masterful experience. For a studio to build up eleven years leading up to this film that has satisfied me and many others, that is a tremendous accomplishment within itself. Also a huge s/o to the actors who have been playing these timeless characters for years and for making them feel incredibly real. All who helped make this movie come into existence should receive high praises.

What else can I say. It is the greatest super hero movie I've ever seen. All I can do left is to tell you to go see it if you haven't already. For those who have been dedicated fans of the Marvel Cinematic Universe for years or if they are new in the game, you will not regret seeing this. It is a thrill that must be seen to be believed.",10
The culmination of the MCU,26 April 2019,"Infinity War left the MCU in a devastated stated and Endgame picks right up where it left off. The story of Endgame is a patient one like the MCU has been throughout the last 11 years and slowly windes you through the rabbit hole. The emotions you go through are from funny to sad and out right stressful. Great story overall and some of the best batch of acting in the entire MCU and by all parties involved. Wonderfully directed by the Russo Brothers. I as a fan can't thank them enough and especially to Kevin Feige for making the MCU what it is which in my opinion one of the best executions of a film franchise ever. This was a clear cut plan to give us the fans a slow and intimate story that began Iron Man and still continues. Thank you Stan Lee. You were the best and will be very missed. We love you and I tip my cap to everyone involved in the MCU.

The acting in this movie is very VERY under rated. This is by far the best performance by the original 6, nevermind the others involved. I feel the Robert and Chris Evans gave us some of the best acting we will see in comic book movie. Thank you to the whole cast. Just awesome

With all this being said I'm going to go see it again.",10
Execellente end for Infinity saga,5 May 2019,Easily the best franchise in history. Taking 22 different chapters of one amazing story and cramming it into one concise ending. This movie could have lasted 5 or 6 hours easily and Anthony and Joe Russo managed to squeeze it down into 3 hours. Amazing.,8
Absolutely best movie of all time,28 April 2019,,10
3 hours and still not enough,8 May 2019,"The biggest minus is, the movie is rushed up. Way too many things to solve and conclude even in this marathon of three hours. Some lost battle opportunities between some characters, plot holes, lazy writing and not enough explained things. But you cannot explain everything and please everybody in a superhero movie. Maybe a trilogy of 7 hours in total, instead of two movies of 5.40 cumulated would have been better. Anyway. The movie is not bad. It has some good performances, especially RDJ's one, it is emotional, it has totally unexpected turns and of course the pretty CGI. It is worth the wait and worth seeing it in cinema 3D. But don't you dare drink something before, or until the last half hour. 3h long, remember?",8

Emotional and powerfull ending to infinity saga,25 April 2019,"Make no mistake , go and see this movie before you get to know too much , perfect ending and what you can never expect is so much joy accompanied by so much emotional pain followed by fantastic oh I mean fantastic humor we all seem to love so very much, thank you , Hail hydra",10
Silly special effects in an even sillier story. BUT the actors starring in it are good and the dialogues between them are terrific,17 March 2020,"The good: how strange it is, that this movie is one of the biggest action blockbusters in history, but the acting performances in it are still really good! Tilda Swinton and Robert Redford, to name a few supporting actors, are starring in it! That's ludicrous. Those actors never star in these kind of movies. But they do, now. Therefore the biggest gift of this Avenger movie are the ACTOR'S. It's an actor's movie!

The bad: it lasts WAY TOO LONG. 3 hours! What were they thinking? I got bored halfway through this story. The story is completely silly, although the dialogues are still very good. There is more bad: lots of SILLY special effects. I mean, come on, with SO much money available they could at least have come up with more credible looking special effects and sets, but they didnt.

Conclusion: nice, mindless fun, with great actors. Too bad the story is so silly and lasts way too long...",6
Nothing happens for the first two hours,6 August 2019,,2
An impact-full end to the many movies before it although being a little messy.,28 April 2019,"Overview: Avengers: Endgame is a messy but an impact-full end to the many marvel movies that came before it. It manages to pay homage to the past whilst showing the possibilities of the future.

Pros: All of the main Avengers have their moments to shine and shine they do. Arcs for Captain America and Iron Man feel thoroughly earned. There are a lot of surprises in the movie and most feel earned and well-developed. Considering how many characters there are in the movie, it is an achievement that it feels natural and not shoehorned. Parts of the movie are much darker than I thought however, the tone remains consistent throughout.

Cons: They do something with Thanos towards the end that erases what happens in Infinity War which undercuts the ""win"" against him in the movie. Most of the messy stuff comes into play with Thor and a spoiler ""thing"" which I will not discuss. The scenes with Thor were supposed to be funny, you know like marvel movies funny, BUT I was not laughing at all. It felt so completely out of place and out of character. It is a horrible direction that the directors decided to take this character, who absolutely shined in Infinity War. Talking of weird directions, a character in Endgame makes a huge decision off-screen that should have been shown on-screen. This didn't feel earned but rushed for the sake of the movie which is 3 hours long. The run-time is mostly justified but there are several and I mean several scenes that can be completely cut of and it would have ZERO effect in the story.

Summary: All-in-all, Endgame achieves its goal of giving a fitting end to the marvel movies and hinting at possible future directions, however, it does so with noticeable faults. Go in with an open-mind and you'll certainly enjoy it a lot.

Rating: 8.5/10",8
Suped duper!,19 January 2022,"Everything comes to an end in the epic superhero movie Avengers: Endgame. After the mass genocide of Thanos, the Avengers come up with a plan to bring everyone back. The writers have again done a great job of integrating and intertwining the various Marvel properties. And the special effects are terrific, especially during the final battle, conveying the enormity of the battle and the many battles between the heroes. Every superhero gets his or her moment to shine, and a number of greatest hits from the MCU are revisited in the style of Back to the Future Part II. Still, there are some pacing issues and more than a few plot contrivances. Despite the problems, however, Avengers: Endgames is an incredible achievement.",8
Phenomenal,27 April 2019,"The best conclusion to anything I have ever watched in my life. There are no words to express what was coursing through my veins throughout the entire film. A must see. It bugs me when people that aren't fans are saying that it's too many movies to start. Now that the movie is number 5 of all time, it proves that it is more than worth it. A must see.",10
A love letter to the previous MCU Movies,24 April 2019,"The first and second act is an absolute love letter to the MCU movies that came before this one. The third act is an emotional roller coaster ride of nerdgasms and cry time which i never thought i will see and feel from a supper hero movie. The final scene hits home big time.

If you are not very familiar with the MCU the first two acts may feel a bit slow for you. But the payoff in the third act is just awesome.",9

"A little bit slow at times, but still one of my longtime favorites",21 October 2019,"This is what the Marvel Cinematic Universe has been waiting for. The culmination of over 20 films in the span of 11 years telling the story of the Infinity Saga. Let me tell you that at the end of it all it was among the, in my opinion, best movies ever made. The first hour races into the story and begins the plot buildup, and although the second hour is slow, every mistake is made up for with the final hour. Such an epic battle scene ending the long, long story of the Avengers. I recommend everyone alive right now go see this movie at least once.",10
Could've been better,25 April 2019,Okay I'm waited a long time to watch the movie and I've got to say I'm pretty disappointed first they made two of the biggest stars into jokes thor is a fat sloppy drunk and hulk is a big green Sissy I don't even think Hulk threw a punch everyone wanted to see all the heroes come back and they did but they lost one of the greats at the end could have been so much better,6
A cinematic event you shouldn't miss! (SPOILER FREE),28 April 2019,"Avengers Endgame had a lot going for it: It serves as the conclusion to a 22-movie saga, it is the sequel to one of the most devastating MCU events (and a one year wait after it) and it must also serve as a satisfying conclusion to all the heroes we watched. The last time, the stakes were so complex, we got Age of Ultron... So we knew the result of too many complex plots in one offering.

So the Russos had a huge thing going on this movie and boy do they exceed expectations as this is THE MOVIE we had been waiting for. Consider your expectations of some top moments you had in your head and this movie brings 3x the amount to it...

This movie has it all... Emotion, Comedy, and boy oh boy, the Action. And best of all, an actual CONSEQUENCE OF ACTIONS. Infinity War's conclusion ain't a gimmick that is resolved. It has lasting consequences which I have expected given the same Russos handled Civil War and it's ramifications...

This is THE MOVIE EVENT that changes you and I can safely would say to the future generations that man I lived during the MCU times and it was worth it. Being an Indian, I did not get the Star Wars phenomenon and now being a part of the MCU journey, I can understand the utter hype when you see the various people in the theatres with their Iron man and Cap's shirts.

I'm glad to be part of this event and I'm going to be going more times...",10
Better actors needed.,5 July 2019,Paltrow and Downey are the two most insipid actors on the planet. No matter the role they play it the same. Banal. Wooden. Worthless. Arrogant. Boring. I can only imagine how much better the films they disgraced would have been with real talent.,6

A FITTING CONCLUSION TO AN EPIC SAGA,23 May 2019,"How do you conclude a 11-year old saga in a way that doesn't mess things up? It does sound like a near impossible task, but the Russo Brothers have surprisingly accomplished it.

'Avengers: Endgame', which marks the end of the Infinity Saga, is spellbounding and surely an enthralling experience. The last film of the 'Avengers' franchise is remarkable and doesn't disappoint. Watching all our favourite superheroes in one film is just surpassing. Marvel has been working on this grand culmination ever since they released 'Iron Man'. I'm damn sure that all of their hard work and ambition has paid off. The directors, Anthony and Joe Russo, have made sure that it delivers an unforgettable experience. Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely have come up with a screenplay full of epic and unpredictable moments. The film has a great balance of humour, emotions and action. The biggest strength of the film is the emotions. This is the most emotional superhero film I have ever seen. It's just perfect. The action sequences were jaw-dropping. The climatic battle left me amazed. It's just filled with memorable moments and cannot be described with words. The visuals are gorgeous and have a great impact on the film. The humour doesn't look exaggerated and manages to entertain throughout the film. The plot twists were very impressive and suspenseful. The film features many cameos of characters from the previous MCU films, which just gives a double dose of excitement. The background score gives me goosebumps, though I've listened to it several times. It was really clever to make changes to the characterization of the Hulk. I enjoyed that a lot. But the show-stealer is Robert Downey Jr, who plays the role of Tony Stark/Iron Man. The man who started it all proves yet again that there's no one else who can perfect his role. Do not miss his powerful moments in the final battle.

However, there are a few parts that haven't hit the mark. The slow-paced story doesn't have a great impact on the film. The first half is very slow and a bit boring and it could have been better, but the second half just overshadows it with the astonishing moments. Thor had always been good enough in the previous films to grab the attention of the fans, but the filmmakers have ruined him in this film. The character who should have been one of the wisest characters is just shown as the biggest joke of the film. It was really interesting and fun to watch Captain Marvel interact with the Avengers, but had she been given more screen time, it would have been more satisfying. Another disappointing fact is that it's no match to 'Infinity War'.

'Avengers: Endgame' isn't the best Marvel film. Nor is it a flawless superhero film, but that doesn't change the fact that it's one of the most satisying conclusions ever. 'Endgame' gives the perfect send-off to our favourite superheroes. This is a sheer spectacle full of twists, turns and suprises. At 3 hours, it does feel long, but the stupendous performances and the character interactions make for a fun and an energetic ride. It's the cinematic event of a lifetime, which you cannot afford to miss.",9

There's no surprises. Just a check in the box.,19 June 2019,Felt like there was no room for creative expression. Everything that happened was expected. There was no real surprise. The addition of Captain Marvel just made things worse since it felt like it was forced to be there. Her character is too much and the actress playing her is boring. It looked like nobody on screen wanted to work with her and I can see why. The movie was good but I wanted more from it. It's worth seeing one time but maybe wait until the DVD.,7

It was such a meaningful film, with so many touching moments that make us think back to the old times of Avengers, one of the most iconic groups we will ever see in this generation. Avengers made me cry, which was not expected. Not one single superhero adventure saga movie has ever made me cry. But this one did. Infinity War left me breathless, and Endgame left me even more speechless. Iron Man's death was so well crafted, so deep and meaningful. This film portrays everything Marvel ever had. Everybody.

I would say that Captain Marvel sticks out like a bit of a sore thumb and is in contrast to the rest of the characters but thankfully she's not it in too much. All the favourites are on point throughout with special devotion given to the original 6 and yet it still manages to accommodate everyone new too. Quite a remarkable and I can't wait to get back to the cinema this weekend and watch it all over again! Thank you Marvel, you've achieved something extraordinary!",9

The Avengers get to a new level. This might be the greatest Marvel movie of all time, and it is worth the 3 hours. As it is a superhero film, not very much blood is shown.

Massive shocks and big plot twists make this a film that's essential to see twice to take everything in I think. The acting and animation is about as good as it gets for now. Some great humour as well.

I will be shocked if another film in 2019 tops this in the film charts and maybe, as sagas go, star wars is now knocked off its perch at the top.",9

Towards the end of the film during the final climax I saw what Marvel really was, more so than infinity war and what it will become into the future.

Amazing end to an epic saga,28 April 2019,Perfect and sad ending to this 11 year saga with amazing fan service and connections to previous movies. I could've asked for nothing more. Would rewatch again 3+ times.,10
WOW - what a ride...,26 April 2019,"... and a ride it was! The movie is a culmination of years of planning, impeccable luck and most importantly hard work. The Engame is the perfect example of what happens when you let the the creative team do what they feel is right.

Well done to you all. Bravo!",10
Satisfying,25 April 2019,This film...I am speechless. All I can say is you don't have to be a Marvel fan to think this movie is insane. Nothing can beat this,10

good,5 April 2020,"The plot is compact and the details are excellent! Many tears, touching. Set the whole room roaring with laughter and make complaints about the max. Although I think about it carefully, the plot is still a bit buggy. For example, where does someone's army get so many particles to transmit. In the past, Loki ran away with the magic cube of the universe, whether it would affect the later time line changes, how to get back on track, dare not play through the details, that's all.",9

"Perfect ""End""ing",27 April 2019,"Scoring this movie less than a 10 does it no justice as it couldn't have been written or acted in every other way. Credit to everyone involved, I was blown away in every scene leading up to its final climax. They mixed in laughs with thrill after thrill to gripping parts. I preordered this movie on ITunes before I left the theater. What am 11 yrs of movies and it's the perfect movie to sum it all up.",10
Amazing,28 April 2019,Amazing finale to the infinity saga if your a marvel fan this is a must see,
An anthem to a marvellous universe,24 April 2019,"Well, I am impressed and honoured to be part of this family. This people getting together to watch and live the epic climax of such a vast and heroic universe. Beacause this film is all about this. About a huge family getting together to fight and save the world. It is not a movie. It is not just a movie. It is in a way a phenomenon, which moves every fan and fills their hearts-our hearts- with enthuisasm, joy and a sense of pride to be a member of this extermely big event.

The film as a film is also one of great value. The conversations between the characters are funny and well-written, the big stars get a nice amount of character developement, most of the plot points feel natural and logical to happen and the final battle is jaw-dropping. The audience experieneces a variey of emotions till the last act- where pathos and amazement are the majror emotions. Great characters, awosome moments, a satisfying fan service and a mixture of emotions.

And although I am not a big fan of MARVEL or superhero films, I actually have to admit that this ""event"" was something huge and important for cinema. And yes, ""artists"" will avoid it and some will find it silly and childish, but I can assure you that this film has a heart and it is like a big, colourful, noisy parade.

Ok, it has its flaws. The first quarter feels ""off"", some of the humour and of the references are too much there is a feministic scene alsmost every Marvel superhero woman is there and it feels cheasy, a little bit of shaky camera, but...

We have characters, epicness, long-shots, a solid soundtrack and a great amount of emotions. And we also learn that whatever happens, good or bad, we will fight it... together.

What a day.

8/10 go experience it with lots of friends and in front of a big screen",7
Fantastic!,24 April 2019,"Just saw it this morning (Australia) and wow, what an awesome movie. It is everything and more I wanted out of the final Avengers movies and it delivers on every level. Had great moments of humour, action and emotion. Can't wait to see it again!!",10

Too Long,27 April 2019,"I watched it. It's boring and tedious. It's slow. It wastes a lot of time with nothing. My favorites are not given much to do. It just seems like three hours I wish I had back. The plot is a ridiculous contrivance. The pacing is leaden. The actors look like they're through with it and glad to be done (Chris Hemsworth excepted). The characters seem less animated and ridiculous than I remember them being (in most Avenger films, there seemed to be a sort of shared agreement that this was all in fun, and, after all, shouldn't it be, it's just a movie. In contrast these seems to want to be more, but more what ... it never seemed comfortable.) A movie like this is supposed to leave you invigorated and ""Wow! That was fun!"" Three hours and one minute is too long for this kind of movie.",

Amazing!,5 May 2019,,10
"Awesome movie, great ending, however...",24 April 2019,"First off, now this is important: THERE ARE NO END CREDIT SCENES, so you don't have to stay after the movie. With that out of the way, let's get to the review. I gotta say, anyone saying this movie was way too predictable, just... Just don't listen to them. Personally, I was surprised how they wrapped up endgame and very pleased with it too. Also, the depth of the characters. Man, that's what carries this movie more than anything. They manage to include everyone's stories and therefore make it easy for the audience to relate to each character, and that for me was a huge part of this movie's success. Acting, CGI, music etc. was on point, and tbh the only thing that bothered me in the movie was the political correctness, even though it was only for a few scenes. To me, these movies shouldn't be sending messages of any kind. It's a fictional world, so why should it be sending political messages to our actual world? Anyway, it is only for a few scenes, and it doesn't take away the class of the movie. At the end of the day, of course I think you should go watch it in the cinema, as I do think it is one of those movies that are far better on the big screen. A word of advice tho, please watch all the previous MCU movies, as there are manyyyyyy references to earlier movies, and it just is a lot of fun to understand them throughout the movie. Enjoy!",10
Absolutely amazing!!,11 May 2019,I've watched lots of movies but this one deserves an oscar. Great scenario great actors everything is great about it. Thank you for letting us be a part of this movie!!,10

IMDb Rating: 8.,8 May 2020,"Movie Review will be this blog's first film review. This is an event film that took us to an entirely new level. This film is an exploration of the heroes' choices. It's a tale of good and evil. There are heroes, and then there are superheroes.

My previous review of Avengers: Age of Ultron was a pretty clear thumbs up. There are things that will stay with me for a long time, and Avengers: Endgame is not one of them.

There were a few things I didn't like when I saw Avengers: Age of Ultron.",8
The Hero With a Thousand Faces,1 May 2019,"Endgame was an eagerly anticipated event (it is an *event*) in my household: family members who saw it before others were assiduous in not revealing spoilers, such was the reverence for the film and not wanting to spoil it for others. Having seen it, I can now understand why.

I'm so old I remember reading the original Avengers comics, and one of the most satisfying things about Endgame was the fidelity, once again, to the spirit of the original comics and their characters, scripted by Lee and drawn by Kirby or Ditko. This is always a huge relief to a Marvel fan. Evans and Downey can be justifiably proud of the way they incarnated their characters, fleshing out in a very real and human way, the 2-dimensional comic. In fact it is a great effort by the whole cast: there is not one weak performance.

It's one of the best-crafted films I've ever seen: this statement gives you a clue that it is not the crash-bang, thrill-a-minute extravaganza that we've come to expect from the genre. There are many poignant and tender scenes early on as the dreadful realization of Thanos's actions in Infinity War become apparent. The plot lines are clever, not contrived; with the trademark humour intact, as the action builds to one climax after another. I was looking out for the woke scenes and sure enough, they do come, but are immediately followed and tempered by a thrilling affirmation of the triumph and tragedy of the life of the Hero. What more can you ask for?

A truly momentous film. Great, even.",9
Goodbye Stark,25 April 2019,,10

Epic ending to a huge era,5 May 2019,,8
Incredible!,26 April 2019,"Incredible culmination of the MCU with great acting, a compelling story and satisfying ending, epic action scenes, emotional moments and memorable fan service. Considering the ambitious task that this film was, there will always be some minor things to nitpick but the Russo's have pulled off something unbelievable in the last 2 years.",
Should've been a two hour movie.,24 April 2019,"The endless scenes with Hawkeye and Black Widow, where both of them look tired and bored out of their minds, I really, really could do without. I understand it's a closure movie, but Marvel needs to realise that self sacrifice themes and melodrama are not touching anymore. They're overdone, cliche, wastes of time. The death at the end, on the other hand, was on spot, not too sugary and truly moving. Thor was just perfection, and the action packed Captain America scenes were definitely looked forward to throughout the movie. I think there is a nine star worth film in this movie, but god it needs editing, the scenes were just stacked on top of another, it was bad guys. I really hope they release a different cut at some point and do this film some justice.",7
"There is no word, and Epic doesn't cut it",27 April 2019,"So I had to create a word, TerrEpicullous. It bring closure while raising new questions. It's the justice all the fans needed and deserved. I hope they teach these phases in schools.",9
Avengers Go Back to the Future,27 April 2019,"I like the movie, but I can't say that it's outstanding. For most fans, it should satisfy. I like the Marvel movies. None of them are perfect, which includes this one. I believe it's worth seeing if you are fan of the previous Marvel films.",6

Best Marvel movie ever!,27 April 2019,,10
A true Marvel triumph!,26 April 2019,"After watching Avengers Endgame twice I can honestly say that it is the BEST marvel film to date. Without giving anything away, which is very hard, this movie is very emotional and intense. I have been a fan of this franchise since the beginning and this is the best ending they could've came up with. The way this movie plays out is not how I would've expected and I love that. It truly is Marvel's victory lap. While it is long it is very worth it. There has never been a movie like it before, with 21 films worth of build up, and there will most likely never be a movie like this again. As I said I've seen it twice and plan to go as many times as I can. It is a one of a kind experience. AND for the love of god don't spoil it for other people or yourself!!!! The best way to watch this movie with a clear mind. Free of any spoilers. If you do this, you are in for a real treat!",10
Brilliant!,25 April 2019,A fantastic film making me laugh and then bawl my eyes out from both happiness and sadness. Possibly the best 3 hours of my life and I'm (although sad about some) overjoyed about the endings for all of the characters. This is what the MCU has built up to. Well done Russo Brothers!,10
Greatest Movie,30 April 2019,This movie is the greatest movie I have ever seen so far. The greatest conclusion we can get for marvel and a wonderful warp up for the infinity saga. I mean so parts of the movie were a bit iffy but overall this is a great movie. I give it a 9.2/10,9

"Good, But Nothing Special",26 April 2019,"Actually it's a good movie, but the directors, writers, and graphic editors don't do a proper job. 1. Some of CGI especially when they wearing the suit is so nasty. The cut in their neck shows a lot, if they are so bad in editing. 2. They don't exploring Thanos so much, so conflict they build in their story line like standard super hero movie, nothing special at all.",7

I Loved it!,4 May 2019,"Yeah, it was a little messy and chaotic but still, it was great! Not what I expected at all but exactly THAT makes it outstanding good for me. No predictable storyline, extraordinary funny moments (still smiling when I think about what happened to the Thor character) sad parts, simply an allover entertaining and exciting experience. It was refreshing to see all characters just as human beings for a while and how in the end they got it all together. Sure, not everything made sense especially when it comes to time traveling...but hey, its not a realistic drama or thriller...its a superhero movie and for me they nailed it and made it an epic final one. :) Cant wait for my first Avengers marathon!",9
"Amazing Movie, loved it",20 August 2022,"This film is the pure definition of an emotional roller coaster and throughout it's run time brings about fascination, humor, sadness, incredible excitement, and sheer finality. This is not your typical superhero movie and some viewers used to the entertaining, nonstop action style of the previous films may be disappointed, but I think that this movie brilliantly satisfies and subverts expectations.",9
An astonishing experience-!,13 March 2020,"I have never in my entire life experienced such a bunch of feelings like this... I could say it was a tornado of shocks, enthusiasm, laughter, sadness, loss. Marvel had created another life in the true life that we live in. Love you 3000.",10

Nonetheless go watch as this will be the last MCU with still a bit of quality. It is obvious which direction future Marvel films will take and it will not be good. Rest In Peace MCU.",6
Found it boring,1 May 2019,"How come so many people love this movie ? It was extremely boring, it was difficult to stay awake for three hours",3
End Game of a New Marvel Franchise Vision,25 April 2019,"Marvel has put his ear on the peoples who care and value the movies, who live and enjoy a character, who is passionate about a good story, a good orchestration of scenes, sounds, direction, photography. But, even more in the social, political, racial and human environment that we live today.

With a very human touch and detachment to what we love the most for universal well-being, with a positive message and hope when it seems that everything is finished.

In a subtle and elegant way, it presents a voice and vision to the audience of the importance of women in today's world, and its relevance to achieving change, equality, rejecting oppression, sexual and labor harassment, and women leaders contribute more and more.

Marvel has shown us that you can be part of something big, regardless of the physical appearance, mental health, color of the skin, be a hero to oneself and others.

Marvel, has left a beautiful legacy, very touching, hopeful, but at the same time questioning the audience. Are we doing enough to help our society and this real universe where we live?. The next superhero of this parallel universe can be you or me, are we ready to do whatever it takes?",10

We're in the Endgame now,12 May 2020,"Avengers: Endgame is the ultimate showdown to what marvel had built over the past 11(12 at the time of this review) years. The characters that you know and love all facing off against the Mad Titan himself, in a do or die mission. Each character has his or her unique backstory and has different emotions and empowering motives to do justice. It's got a ton of action, but what's amazing is that it's got more character as well. It builds up to the finale, but it's the build up and suspense that leaves us in awe.

This movie will make you cheer and make you shed a tear.",10

The End.,1 May 2019,"Insane. Unbelievable. Phenomenal. They pulled it off. The biggest cinematic event in history. What a solid and well deserved conclusion to a 22 film universe. Wow. Really can't explain how somberly epic this movie was. Remarkable. The Russo Brothers have made an extraordinary masterpiece spanning two films that each individually standalone yet mesh together to create a fantastically awesome ending to a saga. A saga built by Stan Lee and carried on through many creative minds in the film industry who have tirelessly work to give the world something new. And boy did they achieve just that. Wow. The pacing made this three hour and fifty-six second blockbuster fly by faster than a snap-okay maybe not that fast. But what incredible editing; the cinematography juxtaposed looked amazing and flowed very smoothly. As daunting as the huge task to make this movie was, the filmmakers took it by the horns and owned it. Outstanding. One to watch over and over again; enjoying newly found one-liners and moments that were not seen before. Discussions will arise, and that's what the best movies always conjure. However far fetched into the future of Marvel movies or the MCU that these audience discussions go, they all have to agree that this was truly a perfect endgame. Heart-warming and grounded; explosive and sensational. This movie literally encompasses it all with an ending to the endgame that will, most definitely, both hold your breath and then take it away, as your jaw drops to the floor. The most iconic, astronomical, epic, glorious, marvelous, a-vengeful third act that will be nearly impossible to ever beat since it is the culmination of over a decade's worth of unparalleled hard work. Avengers: Endgame deserves all the hype and all the soon-to-come broken box office records since it has surpassed all expectations and delivered something unique-which is just about all anyone can ask for from filmmakers. Officially declared as the best this year, so far, yet confidently declared as the biggest monumental event in cinematic history. Loved it three thousand. Wow. -TE (4.25.19)",10
A worthy conclusion of a ten-year journey but no masterpiece,25 April 2019,,
Mixed up feelings,27 April 2019,"I was really hyped. But after I left the cinema I was kind of unsatisfied their were to many questions that were open.

The affects and the Actors/Actress were really beautiful, the film also got something to laugh but as I said I'm not really satisfied with the end.

They don't got any extra scene after the final credits.",7
"""I am inevitable""",30 April 2019,"Endgame is a movie surrounded with mountains of hype, but it lives up to it in ways you wouldn't expect. I will not say it is the most action packed film out there, nor was it destined to be, but it is surely the most emotional Marvel movie created.

Plot- If you have seen Infinity War, you know that whatever the plot may be is almost a surprise. The writers could have made it easier on the Avengers, but they didn't, thus resulting in a highly entertaining experience in which you must accept the fact that the solution is mostly unbelievable. But this is a Marvel movie we are speaking of. Any realistic criticism should be set aside for movies based on reality.

Writing- Marvel got it down beautifully. The way they portray characters in a new light, the way they nail those corny one-liners, the way they interlock the storylines is so amazing yet nothing far from simplistic. They didnt have to go far, they just needed a duration in which they could fulfill each characters destiny. And it is not a rushed process; there is a reason this film is 3 hours.

Plot- This movie takes on a plot nobody expected. When it displayed a time lapse, I was shocked yet thrilled. There is a reason they didn't spoil much in the trailer.

Characters- Nobody is cut short here. Although it is a long film, not one important character is left shorthanded. Maybe some are, but if so, they are left totally open eneded for another film. I cannot spoil this but I will say a major Marvel hero will definitely make another appearance in the upcoming film in phase 5. We obviously know about Guardians 3 and Spiderman: Homecoming, so I will not reveal who will be most prevalent.

Writing- The writing is downright awesome, probably some of the best that they've done. We have characters that bend out of form, hilarity that actuallly has perfect timing, as well as emotion unlike no other Marvel film. For me, ""Logan"" had alot of emotional weight, and this was similar, although they pertain to alternating Marvel Universes. The humour is on point. Never a missed beat.

Characters/Acting- For me, I always think about the contrast between actor and character. I feel like, just as most Marvel movies containing the same characters, that they were uber successful. You feel for these characters- maybe not as much as you would observing them from the start, but they are true to form. Who else would have played these mighty beings?

Quality- Endgame is no joke. It's not a cash-in kind of buy, these people knew what their fans deserved. The editing is prime, the filming is loose yet focused, the sound is perfect, the animation is mind blowing- observe how they make Michael Douglas appear 40 years younger- and the sequencing is phenomenal.

Overall. Endgame does what most logical people want, as well as what most kids don't expect- emotional justification. It's reality. It takes about an hour or so to truly kick in the full-on action, but when you're a fan of the series, you truly understand. It's more about the intensity. The action is delivered at a high caliber, but this story is primarily about the power struggle between humanity and the unknown. Truly amazing.",10
"Not a huge fan, but probably the best one in trilogy",12 August 2019,"The complexity and dozens of meaningless characters thrown in to the sequel was unnecessary and a mess to keep up with. In this conclusion we see our favourite main characters again and some slight twists with a decent ending. The CGI and acting great as usual, however some of the scenes are irritating in their convenience. I.e. captain America taking too much of the spotlight considering his powers.",7

Best part is friendly fight between black widow and Hawkeye,4 May 2019,It could have been slightly shorter... but the end is epic,9
A Splendid Clunky Eton Mess By The End Of It All,24 April 2019,"There is a lot to pack into this movie, even at its 3 hour runtime there is never a dull moment. The first 20 minutes establishes the fallout from the previous film and is handled with an ease of pace and elegance of nuance which lets you know the tale ahead is in good hands.

Establishment phase over and the rollercoaster begins weaving the characters with their egos/fears/hopes/failures/talents into a tapestry which feels familiar and yet unknown. We explore elements of each of our heroes we have seen them display before, but in a light which is full of contrasting tones bursting with risk and daring. Never short on comedy, this usually comes after a harsher more tragic aspect of the tale keeping the audience walking the tightrope of every word or gesture on screen at any moment having a greater meaning.

As the ride picks up momentum and specific undertakings for our heroes begin to take form there are many gags for followers of a specific genre of story and storytelling, as well as a serious and emotional tango, which keeps us guessing at the outcome of several high risk games.

Composition, special effects, score and set design are all of excellent quality and variety therein. Each provide that candyfloss rush which sweetens the story and how it is acted out.

There is a bitter edge to this funfare though, an edge which adds poignance appropriately.

I'm sure any fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe will have a marvelous time watching this excellent conclusion to phase 3 of the MCU and what it holds as the franchise continues forward.",8
Whatever it takes.,25 April 2019,"(No Spoilers) I came into this film after an epic 10 years of just incredible storytelling and didn't know what to expect as this film didn't reveal literally anything in the trailers. Thank god it didn't because my jaw was dropping throughout the film.

Directed by Anthony & Joe Russo, the duo direct the satisfying, amazing and mind blowing end to the 22 films in Marvels story arch they've been developing over the past decade.

The first act feels a little slow but it's to develop the characters to where they are now and it's not boring at all. In my opinion anyway. With characters we've been caring about since day one, each character has their moment to shine. And that final act - without spoiling... holy moly. My eyes couldn't believe what they were seeing.

As a filmmaker: directing was incredible (because it's the Russo brothers). The writing was also amazing with great dialogue moments and sometimes the dialogue means something later on in the film. The cinematography was also amazing, Trent Opaloch didn't utilize the shaky-cam too much, which is great to understand the geography for the fight sequences. The music and editing was also great. The acting though in this film is phenomenal that's all I'll say because if I start giving examples we go into spoilers.

Amazing!,5 May 2019,What a way to close out the infinity stones saga. This movie has it all and truly takes ou on an emotional rollercoaster.,
Butter scraped over too much bread,18 July 2019,"Barring a few shoddy fillers here and there, Marvel's Infinity War saga has been an otherwise enjoyable experience otherwise. However, Avengers: Endgame fails to live up to the expectations set up by its predecessors. The concept of time travel, while quite alluring is ridiculously tough to get right and the Endgame is brave but poor attempt.

The movie is riddled with plot holes and at many places the scenes just feel redundant. You could very well skip a decent part of the movie and trust me, it would hardly make a difference in the end. Major characters like Captain Marvel, Thor and Dr. Strange were underutilized and definitely warranted more screen time.

There are a few positives that would still keep you going. The fight scenes are great as usual. Characters like the Iron Man and the Hulk manage to salvage a decent part of the film. The ending is quite predictable so despite the great action scenes, it fails to leave any significant mark.",6

I really enjoyed this film.,29 May 2019,I saw it in theaters a few weeks after it came out and I think that it raps up the MCU really well. Overall I think it was just an enjoyable experience and can't wait to see it again.,9
Awesome,7 March 2020,"I like the thor entry the most. Nice VFX , worth watching. Checkout the old Avengers also.",10
amazing,24 April 2019,Honestly just great. This movie is one of the best I have ever seen. Words can't describe. A must watch,8
VISUAL TREAT,5 May 2019,"Unbelievably fabulous . For Marvel to pull this tour de force of a film is unreal. 21 films. 21 films culminating in the conclusion of endgame. What a visual treat. The scope is incredible, I will only say it's definitely one of the best Marvel films out there, and there are many. I don't want to spoil anything. Watch it to experience the visual treat!",9
The most emotional movie in the MCU,30 March 2020,"This is one of the only movies I have ever seen on it's opening weekend, and, having seen all the other MCU films going in, I had ridiculously high hopes for it. This movie had to deal with millions of even bigger fans than me around the world, and it didn't disappoint. Everything you love about the MCU is present. The whole film managed to be surprising, endearing, and exciting at the same time. The cast has been doing this so long that they are excellent seemingly without trying, and several returning members provided a lovely surprise. The story unfolds in a direction no one expected (difficult considering the huge amount of theorists churning out alternates) and it manages to stay entertaining for three hours, a huge feat in itself, as well as upholding fan expectations. The script is funny and really!!! sad at the same. The cgi and visual effects are top notch as per with the rest of the movies. All in all, a fantastic, unforgettable movie that leaves an impact on the MCU. It's going to be hard to top this come the next Avengers movie.",10

Very good yet disappointing,27 April 2019,,
Malthusian nightmare?,17 May 2019,"Although we never get to see the more practical aspects of a rapture-like disappearance of half of all living creatures from the universe, we do get to see some obvious indicators that something is no longer right, existentially. For example, people have let their lawns go to weeds, no one figured out how to play baseball with half the teams, and everyone is afraid of dating, presumably out of fear that Thanos might snap his finger again to further reduce the dating pool, with a a 50-50 shot of either you or your lover disappearing into wispy-black confetti, like Rip Taylor on a cold and rainy afternoon in January.

It all begs a few questions, such as why was it not viewed as a positive thing, a Malthusian reprieve from overpopulation and a break from resource competition? Could it not have been the requisite spark for labor to unionize and rebuild a strong middle class, something like what happened in Europe after the Black Death? Seriously, couldn't half the Mets and half the Yankees form one good team to play a team comprised of half the Royals and half the Cardinals? Who is running the nuclear power plants? Why does everyone drive Audis? The Fortnite servers are still up? Why was the 50-50 shot so cruelly applied to Hawkeye? Why not grab the Time Stone first? Were the first 21 movies necessary? Oh, and good thing we still have rats running around storage units, am I right?

Thor, channeling his inner Moondog, has let himself go to weeds, sad and drunk and fat, playing video games all day with couch buddies. Friends are still important, and the hallmark of real friendship can be hidden in a hard-shell taco.

End Game comes with some satisfying cameo reprises, a handful of genuine laughs related to butts and pee, some nice and tender moments, and ultimately a time heist which has to go awry somehow, someway, to justify three hours of cinematic universe.

I keep wondering to myself, why, why does Thanos want to . . . whatever. At least the final moments are filmed brightly enough to understand what is going on, and all the heroes get to play rugby with a magical gauntlet. Or maybe it was Australian Rules Football?",7
Childhood perfected,28 April 2019,"Endgame brings my childhood back to life, brings me tears actually. Remembering playing with all the action figures of all the Avengers & others in the early 90's, seeing all the mcu movies, the Russo's brought this legendary era to a perfect conclusion. All your hopes & dreams will be fulfilled. If you follow these comics you'll feel like a kick again & really become attached to these characters over the last 10 years. This movie truly is bittersweet. I wish it wouldn't end but like Downey Jr./Stark said, ""part of the journey is the end.""",10

AMAZING,24 April 2019,The end of a 10 year old story that really touches your heart and brings you back to your childhood .,10
Best Marvel Movie Ever,26 April 2019,"This is the greatest finale to a series ever. Pretty much every storyline comes together in a satisfactory matter and the last 60 minutes of the movie is amongst the best finales in the history of film. I expect RDJ to get an Oscar Nom for his performance, but everyone in the movie did an exceptional job in their roles. This movie will make you laugh, cry, and cheer; you will experience every emotion you can imagine. I recommend seeing the movie 10/10 and I don't see how any superhero film will ever top this one.",10
Almost Perfect Capper for the MCU to This Point,28 April 2019,"If you saw Infinity War, I think you knew where the overall arc of this would go. I went into Endgame a little arrogant, thinking I knew the whole plot. But one of the big surprises that this movie drops is that it constantly subverts expectations. If you've managed to avoid spoilers, I think you'll be pleasantly surprised with where Endgame goes. What I thought would take the whole movie is done and fully explored in the first 15 minutes. This is absolutely a good thing, superhero movies are always at their best when they're experimental and unafraid of abandoning the formula. While I can't say it completely split off from what was expected, I was excited with every turn or twist in the narrative and I have to applaud the creative team for not just retreading the formula and delivering something off-kilter, at least for the MCU.

Unless you aren't familiar with the marketing, Endgame largely centres around time travel and I was also impressed that they balanced this concept while running through the emotional gauntlet. Most time travel stories come in 2 varieties, the goofy comedies (I would put the Back to the Future franchise, Happy Death Day, Hot Tub Time Machine etc.) or in the completely serious (11/22/63, the Butterfly Effect, The Time Machine). Endgame puts a spin on it where the stakes are very real but you get the classic humour from the best MCU entries. Its a fine line to walk but Endgame does it as an art form, the movie is both very funny and at other points heartbreaking. Its harder to accomplish than you think (even in a normal movie as opposed to this gigantic franchise picture) but they got it done. They also handled the time travel aspect well, some movies fall all over themselves trying to explain how time travel could exist but this was a situation where other than some technobabble, they add a few lines as a catch all and then they move on. Maybe that won't be good enough for some but I just accepted it and kept going.

With so many movies and so many characters to include, doing them all justice and giving everyone ample screen time would have been impossible. But another highlight of Endgame was that they gave all the original players (Ironman, Captain America, Thor, Black Widow, Hawkeye) a side story or mini-arc that was both respectful and added to their respective stories. Its amazing that I can say that just thinking about it now and I tip my hat to them again. I did see this with a group of diehard MCU friends and one of them was upset with how Thor was presented in this move, so it may not be flawless for the whole contingent of fans. But I didn't hear many false notes played and every bit flowed together well. I was also pleasantly surprised that Nebula (played by the wonderful Karen Gillian) got a satisfying amount of screen time that payed off well, it mirrored Gamora's (Zoe Saldana) subplot in Infinity War. The only one who I was disappointed in was our villain Thanos (Josh Brolin) who was a much more interesting character in Infinity War. You could relate to his thought process and identify with him, I feel like the support he got threw Disney off and they made him more of a sadistic jerk in this one to get the desired reaction.

This movie and this franchise features the cream of the crop with the A-list of Hollywood actors and actresses. They all excel together and apart and there isn't a weak performance in the group. This shouldn't be news, with a cast of this calibre, there wasn't even a chance that there would be a weak spot. Some people get more to do than others (I doubt you're going to see this for Don Cheadle's inclusion but if you love War Machine for example, he's not a major player in the action) but everyone does top notch work and I expected nothing less.

There's so much good here that it feels weird to say anything negative. The only thing that really caught my attention is that after the first 15 minutes, the rest of the first hour drags compared to the rest of the movie. It's not uninteresting or boring but it feels like when you're cranking your engine to start your car, you're waiting on pins and needles for the movie to really hit its stride. It gets there and it does its job incredibly but you are waiting for it to fire up for a little while. The other note I would give is that with the inclusion of so many characters, some of the appearances are a little one note. Ant-Man is there to largely dump exposition and pump up Cap and Carol Danvers is in the movie way less than what you would expect (I was in the camp that enjoyed Captain Marvel, if you didn't, this may not be such a bad thing). But these are very minor issues in a movie that scores at least 9/10 things right.

Endgame will be so many different things to so many MCU fans, whether you see it as a kick @$$ blockbuster, the culmination of the MCU to this point, the final farewell to some of your favourite MCU originals or maybe the best action movie you'll see this year. I think it does about as good of a job as you can expect (if you're even a casual Marvel fan, you're going to dig this) with the pressure, the expectations and the weight of all the success the franchise has had dominating the box office for over a decade. There are points of the movie that are slow and not as interesting but when Endgame kicks into gear, it flies down the road. I still slightly prefer Infinity War but its a 1A) to 1B) comparison as opposed to one being a 10 and the other being a 7. Unless you're suffering from serious superhero fatigue (which I wouldn't blame you for) or just dead set against the MCU, you're going to really enjoy this movie. Endgame is a 9.5/10 that checks all the boxes and caps the MCU to this point in a fun, touching and above all exciting 3 hours at the theatre.",9

"A continuation of ""Infinity War"", Thanos has to be dealt with and it takes all Avengers.",26 August 2019,"My wife and I watched this movie at home on DVD from our public library, about 11 months after we similarly watched ""Infinity War"" where Thanos wanted to destroy half the universe.

In fact the very first scene of this one depicts people, parts of families, just disappearing. Thanos is so powerful, and possessing all the infinity stones, would take a giant coordinated effort by all the Avengers to figure out a way to defeat him. And only some kind of time travel to secure each infinity stone would enable them to accomplish what is needed.

The movie is long, very long, at just over 3 hours with the credits. We just can't watch a 3-hour movie in one sitting after steak and wine so we watched it over two consecutive nights.

It is a good movie, characterizations are very good, as is the inventiveness of the story line. The least interesting to me were the CGI-full epic, frantic battles. They just became audio and video ""noise"" to me. But the hand-to-hand fighting was much better, as were the actual interactions of various characters.

I don't see a listing for the next Avengers movie so is this the last one?",
"Predictable,but Good( My Opinion)",26 April 2019,"Avengers EndGame starts with the aftermaths of Infinity war(that spidy thing really left me emotional).The movie starts off well and after some time it becomes predictable,but comedy fills that void. There are some really hilarious scenes in the movie and you really gonna enjoy them . The entire 2hrs of the movie deals with the Time Heist thing, and the last 1hr is the much awaited combat between avengers and Thanos,the mad titan, which was quite clumsy and not that effective than Infinity war. And I didn't felt any emotion while watching the dying of our favourite avenger and I felt like the movie and the franchise should end in any way , so Russo brothers hurried in making that and it was so clumsy. The final battle VFX were not great for a movie like this. So , finally it ended . And I felt emotional not because of the movie ,but for I'm not going to see these avengers next time. Overall , EndGame is not a bad movie,nor a great. But it's a good movie with some good comedy and drama. (Infinity war stands first)",7
It's even better the second time round...,28 February 2020,"This is the culmination to end all culminations. Just superbly well done and is such a well balanced blend of action, laughs, cries and sensational acting and film making. Stretching the CGI prowess of our time to the limits and concluding a brilliant series of films. I really hope the next series of films do these justice. Without RDJ they will be missing a major part of the exceptional element to these films but hopefully with the talent available a new type of RDJ will appear. I think I'll leave it a few months and then start rewatching them again.",9

High-end special effects cannot save it.",1
Best Marvel movie ever,24 April 2019,"This is my first time ever writing down a review but I just have to say that the movie left me speechless. It was a rollercoaster of emotions from the very beginning. The directors did a really great job. Although it was 3 hours long, but you don't feel as if the movie was that long. I wished that I could write down more but I don't want to give out any spoilers. All that I can say is that it was definitely the end of an era.",10

"If you haven't, don't! Then it can't be ruined",12 May 2019,"A box office success, sure, not based on its merits though but rather that of its predecessors. Visually spectacular as we've come to expect from the Avengers franchise (and the only reason for the stars) otherwise unnecessarily long, bordering on boring and full of plot holes. A few endearing scenes and one major scene were the only semi-redeeming factors. Otherwise just SO SO disappointing **SOB**",2
Powerful Movie,3 May 2019,The most impactful movie in the entire MCU! Going to see it again and will be just as amazing as watching it the first time. It's a tear jerker for sure but plenty of humorous scenes that don't dilute the serious ones. Thank you Marvel and Disney!,9

The Best Series Ever Made!,11 March 2020,"I've watched close to 10,000 movies in my 28 year lifetime, and this series had me in every emotion in this long journey. From Iron Man 1 to Spiderman Far From Home was just fantastic. Some movies were worse then others but Avengers End Game and Avengers Infinite War were by far the best. Incredible film",10
"This film was released wide across the USA on April 26th, 2019",13 March 2022,"The Marvel Cinematic Universe came to an eleven year, semi-conclusion, with this extraordinary film. It concluded a 23 film saga, rich with Marvel characters and stories, that culminated into an amazing franchise plot arc. Marvel hasn't missed a beat during this whole run and even though, we kind of, anticipated that, eventually, they would cross everybody over into one big, giant Avengers film, it still amazed a very satisfied public. It made the fans happy. It made the average, every-day, audience happy. It also was the highest grossing movie of all time, for a little bit. It was, hopefully not, a wonderful swan song for some as well.

The Russo brothers had been spearheading the direction of the franchise's plot arcs, during this later half of the franchise run, with Captain America: Winter Soldier (2014), Captain America: Civil War (2016) and Avengers: Infinity War (2018). After setting up the big finale in the later film, everyone in the world wanted to know what happened after Thanos (Josh Brolin), snapped his fingers. The MCU had an appeal with audiences across the board. They were smart to mix up the movies, in a way, that they can attract certain sectors of the audience into the fold, in order to get everyone excited for this grand finale.

This brings us to the final endgame and the fate of the universe hangs in the balance. Three weeks after the events of Infinity War, our heroes are still searching for Thanos, in the weeks since he did the snap and the great vanishing happened. Thanos wanted to eliminate half of life in the universe, in order to create a better balance for its stretched resources, but like all bad guys, he did it the wrong way. Enter the remaining Earth's finest heroes, who find Thanos, thanks to Rocket Racoon's (Bradley Cooper), knowledge of technology, but the attack on Thanos is futile. Since there is no way to fix things, the Avengers go back home to lick their wounds and wonder what will come next.

Five years go by, the still-remaining Avengers stumble across an idea to go back in time and retrieve the infinity stones. By doing this, they are able to change the course of history before Thanos gets a chance to snap his fingers. A lot has changed in five years. The current stage of life on Earth is rocky at best. Things are not good. This plot direction allows the Russos to give the audience a wide array of interesting character developments that happen to our heroes. The lives of characters like, Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Banner (Mark Ruffalo) and Tony Stark (Robert Downey JR.) are playfully, but creatively entertaining and thought-provoking. The character development in this film is done quite well.

The Russos piece together a tale that is perfect for the comic book fan, as well as, the general audience. Every character in the MCU gets a fair shake at making an impact in the overall plot. Every actor has their moment to shine. The villains have their moments too. The story is perfectly crafted to work as a major motion picture of heroic proportions. The film has a cool prologue, is set up in three nicely packaged parts and has a history making epilogue. They had the right story, based off of the original source material that made this enjoyable for audiences everywhere.

9.3 (A MyGrade) = 9 IMDB.",9
We're in the endgame now.,26 April 2019,"This is a historic movie. The story that Marvel crafted for over a decade comes to its conclusion in an epic 3-hour film that is for the ages.

All the characters, some of which we've known and loved for years and others we just met, get their share of love and their time to shine, with cheers and applause ensuing several times. There were tears aplenty, but also quite a few laugh, in particular from a character you don't usually think of as comic relief. The movie takes time to show us the unbearable loss of Infinity War and how the Avengers each deal with it, before a way to bring back all of the victims of the Snap appears. But don't think you know how this is going to go because whenever you think THAT was the big twist, there's probably another one coming.

New abilities are revealed, emotional arcs are fulfilled and heroes change as Marvel lays the ground work for its next phase that will officially start after the release of Spider-Man: Far from Home this summer. Endgame ends with an open door to the MCU's future, but for the first time since its beginning, the movie does not feature a post-credit scene, leaving us wondering what's to come.

I feel like this is the kind of movie I'll be happy to say I saw in the theater the day it came out 30 years from now when they remake it for the third time. This is a once in a generation cultural phenomenon and I hope you go see it in the theatre because you will not regret it.",10

Amazing movie with an amazing ending,3 May 2019,"Just incredible. Perfect combination of funny, sad, exciting, suspenseful and thrilling",10
"3/4 ""Meh"", 1/4 ""Woah!!!""",15 May 2019,"I wasn't that keen on ENDGAME, there... I said it. I went into this film with high expectations (thanks to all the hype/money it's made/phenomenon that was INFINITY WAR) and was rather let down. There were two real problems with this movie: 1) it's WAY too long and subsequently becomes rather unfocused on reaching it's conclusion. 2) it is just plain BORING for it's opening 2 hours and a half! There's no material that grips me/makes me say ""wow"", unlike INFINITY WAR which blew my socks off within the first 10 minutes.

There are several plot lines that are both uninteresting and unnecessary. I'm all up for character-building, but do we need much more character-building after 15 WHOLE MOVIES, and does it really have to take up 2 AND A HALF HOURS OF SCREEN TIME?!! I don't mind a film needing a build-up but this was quite frankly RIDICULOUS, especially when (despite being 2 hours and 40 minutes) INFINITY WAR cut to the chase pretty quickly while still making us feel for the characters.

However, to say that ENDGAME was a total loss would be untrue. The final quarter/ending of the movie will leave you awestruck and sad! It's a brilliant ending that fires on all four cylinders, so it's just a shame that the rest of the movie had to be so tedious/unnecessarily stretched-out!",7
Too looooong,25 May 2019,Could have been an hour and a half and twice the movie.,2
Avengers: WTFgame,1 May 2019,"The only way to explain this movie is ""Cognitive Dissonance"". Its foundations are fundamentally cracked with the best plaster covering it.

The Good? Most of the Characters are given satisfactory closure and/or sequel-fuel, in particular Tony, Cap, Thor and GOTG. The Visuals are amazing and breathtaking. Actions Scenes have large pay-offs for series veterans. Highly emotional and atmospheric.

The Bad? The film introduces too many plot threads, then it is attempting to close pre-existing ones. Some of the humour doesn't work. Thanos lacks the development that IW gave him.

The Ugly? The main plot gimmick is non-nonsensical. Thor is just awful.",8
The Epic Conclusion of 11 Years of Films,11 May 2019,"Endgame does a fantastic job at wrapping up what the MCU has been building towards for the past 11 years. The conclusion was satisfying bundled up with great action scenes and amazing character moments. Not many people enjoyed the first act of the movie, but I actually did because I felt that the build up for the events that come later on in the film was necessary. I think it does a great job at showing how people are (trying) to cope with half of life in the universe turned to dust. Any MCU fan needs to watch this film to watch how all 22 films become tied together in this amazing cinematic event finale!",10
A perfectly beautiful ending to one of the best series of our generation!,26 April 2019,"This movie has everything we all love so much about the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Without giving away too much, everything was wrapped up nicely. There were several hair raising moments and a few nice throwbacks to the series. I couldn't have asked for a better ending. This movie did justice to all the movies leading up to this and now I'm sad that it's over. My heart is heavy. I will rewatch and relive these movies as many times as I can.",10

Expected a lot more of Thanos than they showed. An anti-climax of epic proportions. Wasted a lot of time on story than strategy. Expected more.. a lot more.",7
Painfully boring soap opera,4 May 2019,,4
The End Of An Era,4 January 2023,"Avengers: Endgame is the perfect ending to all 22 MCU movies. It connects so well. I've watched it a MILLION times, over and over again, It's a ride to watch it over again. We've said goodbye to some of our favourite heroes, unfortunately.

Avengers: Endgame is the best movie ever made. It was the highest grossing film, it made $2.797 billion. This film is an emotional rollercoaster with some of the coolest superhero plot lines ever drawn up.

This film is the sort of assemblance we've always wanted. I can't believe it's almost been 4 years since the release.

It has such mixed feelings when you watch it, both sad that it was the last assemble with The Avengers and probably the last movie with a big cast as big as this had.

I was supposed to write this review in 2019/2020 but forgot. I was supposed to watch it after I watched it in the cinemas back in 2019 or 2020.",10

Rethink and rate it,26 April 2019,"When you see the movie, you may feel like lets give 10/10 for it. But when you come back home and think it may not be worth it. A good film is which follows you even when you are out of theater. Issues with the film 1) pace of the film. This is the most slow paced film in the series I guess. Easily this could be ended in 2:30 hrs or little more action would have been better 2)plot holes: plot holes in some films, we tend to ignore because we are carried away by the whole scene/movie. But in this, some questions keep on hitting us even inside theater.

Overall I like the movie. It is watchable of course. And the way main story is developed is good. Most of us won't expect the way it unwinds. And the way they treat Thor and Hulk will be unbearable for their hardcore fans/comic book fans. Since I am a captain fan, I find it awesome for his scenes.",7

"A fitting conclusion, but ultimately overrated.",26 May 2019,"The title of this review may lead you to believe that I am not a fan of this film - which is false. I actually like this film quite a bit, but ultimately does not deserve the 'one of the best movies ever made' reputation it is getting.

Let's talk about the pros:

The visuals are outstanding. The CGI team once again prove they are on top of their game here and the work here is marvelous. I must also note that the directors (The Russo Brothers) did an excellent job of carrying 30+ characters into the film and still managing to give each and every one a moment to shine. There is also an exceptionally large amount of buzz surrounding the ending of this film (as well as the final hour in general), which I believe more than definitely contributes to the film being held with such high regard - and yes, the final hour is fantastic

BUT...

Let's not forget that this is a three-hour film and almost all of the flaws are contained in the first two hours. The majority of the first act of the film is significantly slower-paced to the rest, which on it's own works as it uses the time wisely as it perfectly portrays the aftermath of the events following Infinity War. However, this slow-paced first act ultimately affects the overall structure of the film as the second and third act are much faster.

I also have some issues with the second act, there are definitely some scenes here that could easily be removed without affecting the plot (and the film would actually be overall better as a result). For example: The 'diner' scene in which Hulk poses with fans is cringe-worthy at best and while it's intention is be funny is instead awkward.

CONCLUSION

Avengers: Endgame is definitely a must-watch for fans of the MCU and action films in general, but let's not overrate this purely because of the final act.

Highly disappointed :(,29 April 2019,"Had a lot of expectations. But everything fizzled out. Wanted it to end after interval but friends, huh.

They made the mockery of Hulk, Thor and Doctor Strange. They are damn powerful in the comic folklore but the movie ruined everything.

Pro- Captain America got the limelight and am happy about that.

The execution of women empowerment was not that great. Then the mantle of captain america was passed on to different character. Good that the society is learning but it should not be the case of getting money from all the sections by showing off/or what you don't have faith in.

Guardians of the galaxy is far better than this. I am disappointed.",1

END OF AN EPIC ERA,23 April 2020,"If someone wants to understand the story of Avengers: Endgame, he/she has to watch all the previous movies of MCU. Avengers endgame is one of the most entertaining, emotional impactful, stunning blockbuster movie that I ever watched. It also shows the success of Avengers infinity war. The plot is set after Thanos uses the infinity stones and wipes out 50% of the living organisms of Universe in Avengers infinity war. The left behind are desperate to do something to bring back their lost loved ones. But after an initial attempt -- with extra help from Captain Marvel (Brie Larson), purposeless Avengers think all hope is lost. They're reenergized by the eventual reappearance of Scott Lang, aka Ant-Man (Paul Rudd), who was stuck in the quantum realm during the fight on Wakanda. He believes there could be a way to reverse Thanos' deadly snap. It takes a while to gather the squad -- some of whom have changed dramatically -- but eventually Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Captain America (Chris Evans), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Rocket (Bradley Cooper), Nebula (Karen Gillan), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), and Ant-Man team up for one last life-or-death battle against Thanos (Josh Brolin) and save the universe. This was the perfect way to end the characters of Ironman, Captain America and Black widow. The end part is very emotional. I personally didn't like the role of Thor in this Movie, as he gets fat and was unable to fight properly. Overall this Movie ends the 4th era of Marvel cinematic universe and begins a new Era.",8
"Avengers Endgame (Not a Review, Only Opinion to avoid Spoilers) - FS",24 April 2019,"Considered as the Finale or the final chapters of the Avenger Series, it is the 22nd film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It is the only film of this century that has garnered such a Huge demand in domestic as well as International Markets. Fans, especially the kids and teenagers are awaiting its release with baited breathe and fortunately I was able to watch the movie couple of days earlier than the International Release.

The Movie is 3 hours long but believe me it is too short to cover such as vast ensemble cast and package all their stories into it within the stipulated time. I believe that the movie should have been made into two parts. Why I feel this way? Let me explain it to you. There are certain parts of the movie where you feel they are trying to build up the story and later you realize that they just dragged it and there are other scenes in the movie where you feel it is being done hastily before we the audience could sink in the gravity of the scene or the moments resulting the emotional scenes as bland. Now why would they even consider building up the story as Avengers Infinity Wars had already set the stage for the Finale? Everyone who has watched the prequel to Endgame only wants to know how these Heroes will make things right and how emotionally they have been affected.

If they had made it in two parts then every character would have shined like in Infinity War but here even the main characters fail to make an impact. There are jokes here and there but they aren't enough. There are too many unnecessary, silly scenes that only consume time and nothing else. I believe after watching the Endgame, every fan will agree that Infinity Wars is the best movie of the Franchise. If you recall Captain America - Civilian War then it reminds you of the brilliant action choreography because most of it is done in the daylight as against the dark creepy VFX settings like most of the other Superhero flicks. Even the Infinity War triumphs in the Grand Battle because everything was done in daylight. Those scenes looks real compared to the dark graphics. I was Very disappointed with the Finale 8 -10 mins of Grand Battle of Endgame, it was similar to Aquaman.

My opinion may sound bit negative but its not, you will definitely enjoy the movie and there are some good moments including is a moment where you may get heartbroken, I mean literally if you are a Marvel Fan. It is one of the most heartbreaking emotional scenes ever in a Superhero Flick because of its impact. Go watch it and enjoy but go with lower expectations so that you can enjoy more.

"Good concept, poor execusion",29 June 2019,The idea of the film is there. What killed the movie overall was the writing and the poor choices made by the director. I get that they wanted to pander to the younger kids that were 12 or younger but went to ridiculous lengths to do so that killed any reason for anyone over the age of 30 to like it beyond being happy that their children liked it.,1

I love it!,19 November 2023,"Avengers Endgame promised to answer questions about how the story would continue, how our heroes would defeat Thanos, and what would happen next. Many theories about the movie were put forward before its release. Despite high expectations, the film surpassed them all, delivering more than what was anticipated.

Some people compared Endgame to Infinity War, wondering which one was more successful. However, the two films should not be seen as separate stories but rather as one story divided into two parts. The new movie was a fitting finale to the story that began with Infinity War.

Avengers Endgame pays tribute to the ten-year history of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, focusing on the original Avengers team. Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Hulk, Black Widow, and Hawkeye are the main characters, and their interactions and struggles take center stage. Other characters, including Captain Marvel, also play important roles in the story. However, the film's emphasis is on the importance of being a hero and a family, not on how strong a character is.

Despite its strengths, Avengers Endgame has some flaws-the film's length, three hours, may be too long for some viewers. The beginning of the story moves slowly, and some scenes are emotionally heavy. However, the pace picks up later, leading to an action-packed final 45 minutes. The movie's visual effects are impressive, and the action scenes are well-done. Although there are some small errors in the plot, they are insignificant compared to the film's overall success.",9

AN ABSOLUTE SUPERHERO MASTERPIECE!!! EMOTIONAL & OUTSTANDING.,8 September 2019,"WOW!!! End Game, that film blew me away, It's truly a MASTERPIECE of cinema & not just of the comic book world, i was amazed at how beautiful & devastating this movie was & how deeply it affected me!!! Everything came together perfectly to create something really special & powerful, that much talent & characters all come together in a beautifully touching way it really is a technical masterpiece of filmmaking!!!

I'm massively into the ""Avengers"" movies but not so much all the characters own films as there's so many, but the ones i have seen have all been excellent, Captain America & Hawkeye are my favourite characters of the Avengers team & I've loved all the Avengers films right upto ""End Game"" & then just WOW!!!

This is a very dark & apocalyptic fantasy Thriller, all the stakes are higher & the atmosphere is of sadness & loneliness, Clint aka Hawkeye really feels like the heart of this particular Avengers film as we see him as the ordinary & loving Family man who loses his family & becomes a dangerous vigilante, Hawkeye uses his skills to hunt & kill criminals & you feel his sadness,his anger & his despair & Jeremy Renner gives the best performance so far as the troubled Hawkeye, it's a dark path for a complex character & that's just the start of End Game. The Awesome underrated Renner steals the show from the epic suspenseful opening back as Hawkeye, please give this guy his own movie!!! Renner doesn't get the recognition he deserves for his role as Hawkeye, his scenes are always favourite & he packs so much intensity into his part, best Avenger. Captain America is the main big beating heart behind all this darkness & Chris Evans gives his most powerful performance so far as cap, Black Widow has some extremely dark & emotional moments & Tony Stark shows why he's such an important Avenger as well as the smartest!!! Heroes rise & Heroes fall.

All the characters are fantastic here in End Game, each character is given more depth,drama & emotion so you really care for this team. The apocalyptic world is very eerie with half the people missing, it's creepy & lonely looking, the atmosphere is dark & gloomy & our heroes need to change this world. End Game still has hilarious moments scattered throughout it's huge running time as it does with the amount of emotional drama & action packed scenes, there's never a dull or boring moment i thought as i totally got into this dark new world created by the evil ""Thanos"" The Action is breathtakingly Awesome & the c.g.i fx are Outstanding to the highest quality with it's massive budget put to full use, this is an epic film in every way!!! The visual look is stunning!!! By the End i was an emotional wreck as the characters touched my heart & the action put on screen blew me away, this is the best Avengers movie it's also the ultimate Comic book movie & an instant CLASSIC.

Just watch it & laugh & cry at a MASTERPIECE of cinema. When it ended i felt a big sense of loss,sadness & Happiness & that's how this masterpiece grabs you by the heart!!! Excellent but my personal favourite Avengers film is still ""Age Of Ultron""",7
Just Okay,1 May 2019,"After all the hype and build up for this I was expecting a little more than a romantic end to the MCU's most beloved franchise. Plot holes, character development and all around story really made the experience less than memorable. In the people that loved it or disliked it that I've talked to I feel like a 50/50 split is what I'm hearing although after enjoying the previous marvel films. I do not know if the people who rated it so high just feel an obligation to themselves to say they loved it so in their heart they weren't let down or that they did truly enjoy this giant mess of a movie. Take the popularity out of the franchise I think if this was released at the beginning of the MCU the rest wouldn't have done as well. That's my 2 cents.",4

3 Hours of Epic Proportions,31 July 2022,"I don't even think it's debatable to say Avengers Endgame is peak Marvel. It's a movie that keeps everyone on the edge of their seats throughout the entirety of it. The cinematography is beautiful, and there's lots of unexpected moments that push the movie farther and farther into its 3 hours. This is the perfect conclusion to the Infinity Saga, bringing together one of the best scenes in movie history at the end fight. Time travel is explored beautifully and in a new way. The Russo brothers topped themselves and the entirety of the MCU with Endgame. The theater experience was great, and so is each time I've watched it after. Robert Downey Jr. Delivered peak Iron Man, along with Chris Evans with Captain America, and Scarlett Johansson with Black Widow. The original 5 get new great moments, and the big 3 really get to nail in some legendary scenes. Anyone who watches this movie will be pleased and feel every bit of happy that they got this movie after years of MCU. It brings everything together in a crossover event that can't be matched. I hope to one day see something close to it again.",10
Fantastic!!! BUT...,25 April 2019,,9
The best finaly for the MCU,24 April 2019,"This movie is a loveletter to the entire MCU with lots of callbacks to the previous movies and gives nearly every characterarc a fullfilling conclusion. Some of these will continue in upcoming sequels, but as a last Avengers movie it is a great final round with lots of impressive moments to remember.",10
The best movie marvel has made,28 April 2019,"This movie contains everything that a comic based superheros movie must have. It has perfectly timed funny jokes, Jaw dropping action scenes and an unpredictable story with various twists. Also acting of everyone is awesome. If you have seen all the previous marvel movies then you are surely going to love this one, if you haven't watched I recommend you to do so or else you won't understand some important things in this movie.",10
Slightly Disappointed...,25 April 2019,"What can I say, there was no film this year that i was more excited about. The first two/two and half hours were perfection. I loved so many things but once it was over i felt a bit underwhelmed. It might have been due to the hype or my anticipation but i was left unsatisfied.

It is also difficult to talk about this film without spoilers but Thor and Hulk were incredible and most definitely added to the comedy.

RDjr and Chris Evans bring their A game and their performances are great!

Don't walk into it hoping to see your favourite villain Thanos as he is sidelined for the majority of the picture. I don't see this as a negative though as this film is about the Avengers.

Most will love the hell out of this film and i will certainly be seeing it again soon, but for the now, i'm not too sure how i feel about it.",7
Fantastic film,28 April 2019,,10
"Gigantic, layered, massively crowded Avengers conclusion is lumbering but hard to dislike",16 June 2019,"The long-awaited conclusion to the Marvel's Avengers film franchise puts everything in perspective from the previous installments. If you are a diehard MCU devotee, this film will likely be your must-see of the year. For the disengaged or the downright uninitiated, this is actually not bad.

Although clearly aiming for the franchise to hit the highest of highs in terms of catharsis, the film's emotional impact is diluted by its sheer size. The many, many different characters are utterly dwarfed by the film's enormous scope. The good news is, the story is a straightforward battle of good and evil with very little in the way of divided loyalties or moral quandaries. But there are so many players and so many backstories to tie together, that you could be forgiven for feeling more relief than a visceral thrill when it's all said and done.

On the plus side, there is a stirring musical score and a heartfelt ending that will put all doubts about the film's soulfulness to rest. Although the Avengers franchise in its totality isn't quite my cup of tea, I recommend this as solid, quality entertainment.",7
Incomprehensible.,22 July 2019,"Just try to imagine someone who didn't watch the 22 previous Avengers movies, watching this movie.

It's just totally incomprehensible.

And even for someone (like me) who watched the previous movies, how can I remember all the details after 11 years ?

Too many characters and too much talkings, this movie is BORING ! A pile of private jokes doesn't make a good movie.

I give 3 stars for the last 20 minutes. Just for the SFX, but I don't understand who fighting who and why.",3

An End of an Era...,26 April 2019,"This is a special movie. Movies like this come out rarely and they aren't always good. The one before this was Logan, and even thought Endgame is on a much larger scale, the feelings, I left the theater with, were very similar.

This is one of the boldest MCU movies, in terms of creative choices, and one of the darker ones, in terms of stakes. I really felt our heroes were in genuine danger throughout the movie. Endgame retains that lighthearted charm, that we've come to love in Marvel movies, but also takes itself very seriously.

When I look back on previous MCU movies, i realize that this is one of their most beautiful movies, in terms of cinematography. The only letdown for me was the score, as in some vital spots it was barely noticeable and/or repetitive.

The cast was solid throughout. The Original Six and in particular MCU Trinity take the center stage here and all do their finest acting....

The emotional payoff - especially when I first saw it in theaters - was huge. But in rewatching, the story is nonsensical and not in a deep, ""you need to think about it"" way. Without the satisfaction of a years-long story paying off and wrapping up at last, this is a poorly done movie with too much CGI and glimpses of good acting from actors working with a less than great material.",6

This is a movie that broke me, put me back together, and broke me again in one of the most impactful cinema experiences ever.

This is one of the best cinematic experiences I've ever had, the portal scene is my favorite scene in all of superhero movies, and this movie has the saddest ending of all time, it broke every rule and I would not change a thing. This is one of the four movies that has actually made me cry in my life and there are no words for how lucky I feel to have seen this in the theater.

There are so many epic moments that you are going to witness. You will laugh and cry every now and then. It is a wild ride from beginning to end. It reminded me why I love movies.

TYPICAL MARVEL FILM,11 December 2019,"Predictable plot. Predictable outcome. A few plotholes and convenience plot device here and there. Awesome last fight though, especially involving Cap. Probably made some goosebumps. (it didn't to me, though)

The film tries to invoke emotions from the audience, but when it tries it too much, somehow it soften the blow, even when it involves characters you care about. However, this is definitely the way if wanna close out some chapters of a character. Build them up slowly and then go for the payoff. Not do it in 2 films.

Overall, I'd say it's a typical Marvel film. It's definitely a love letter to the fans who have been watching since Ironman 1 came out. But having said that, they probably will never reach the heights of these past few films have achieved. Probably.",7
A Perfect End For An Era.,6 July 2019,,10
Two Endings and About a Half Hour Too Long,30 April 2019,"I won't include any spoliers in this review.

The movie is good and worth the six bucks I paid to see it. To be honest, there were a ton of super heroes in it that I could not even identify. And I'm pretty sure a couple of actors who come up in the end credits weren't even this movie at all!

For the most part, the movie keeps your attention with pretty much non-stop action and a decent storyline that follows up on the half-end of Earth ending from the last installment. It's a BIG movie with huge special effects and I imagine the entire roster of Marvel characters.

For me, the Black Panter group appearance was rather unintentionally laughable. I think it's the wakest of all Marvel super heros. And that brings up another point -- when all the super heroes work together you realize how dumb some of their super powers are.

There were not as many off hand comic remarks as seen in previous Marvel movies and I think that was to the detrement of the film. The new Thor is pretty funny, however.

As you might expect, the finale is a really big one and all the big guns are brought out for the ending. And when it's all done, you have to sit through a rather unnecessessary 30 minute coda. It reminded me of the third Lord of the Rings installment that just kept ending as well.

So the net net is, the movie is good, not great and a half hour can easily have been cut without a problem.",7

Whatever it takes,24 April 2019,I wish I could rate this movie in 3.000 stars. It really deserves it.,10
The Cinematic Event of a Lifetime,8 July 2019,"Marvel Studios' 'Avengers: Endgame' is the end of a journey 11 years and 21 films in the making. This journey began in 2008's 'Iron Man', the film that launched the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) and every Marvel Studios film since then has led us here. I assure you though, 'Endgame' is the PERFECT ending to the 'Infinity Saga', as it's been dubbed. The film revolves around the remaining Avengers trying to undo the catastrophic loss of life brought on by Thanos in last year's 'Avengers: Infinity War'. Eventually, with the help of Scott Lang/Ant-Man, they discover a way to go back in time via the microscopic Quantum Realm and try to steal the 6 Infinity Stones and bring back all the lives that were lost. The film's runtime is a little over 3 hours, but that's because there's a LOT of story to tell, and not a SECOND of it feels slow or unnecessary. From the opening scene, 'Endgame' grabs your attention with the force of the Infinity Gauntlet and refuses to let go! The film's directors, Joe and Anthony Russo, manage to juggle a vast amount of main characters and story threads BRILLIANTLY, without ever making the story feel boring or rushed. Everything flows PERFECTLY from one scene to the next, and (at least in my opinion) never gets confusing or hard to follow. Well, there actually is ONE scene where Bruce Banner explains how time-travel works in the MCU, and I didn't really understand it, but it's time-travel so no one knows FOR SURE how it actually works. Other than that, I understood everything just fine. Now, onto the acting. 'Endgame' features some of the BEST acting performances I've EVER seen in a Marvel movie, from Chris Evans (Steve Rogers/ Captain America), Scarlett Johansson (Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow), Jeremy Renner (Clint Barton/Hawkeye), Chris Hemsworth (Thor) and Tom Holland (Peter Parker/Spider-Man), but the standout performance is definitely, without a doubt given by Robert Downey Jr. (Tony Stark/Iron Man). I'm not kidding when I say RDJ deserves an Oscar for his performance. The film also has THE BEST third act in the HISTORY of comic book movies. It's nothing short of ASTONISHING how they were able to pull that off, but they did, and it was the greatest thing my eyeballs have ever witnessed. There's a very emotional scene towards the end of the movie where, for the first time in my 20 years of life, I FULL-ON ugly-cried watching it. It was bad. I pretty much cried from that scene until the end of the movie, so I HIGHLY recommend you bring tissues. Maybe an adult diaper too, because you are NOT gonna wanna get up to pee. So, to wrap this up, 'Endgame' is more than just a movie. It's the cinematic event of a lifetime, the likes of which I doubt we'll see again for a VERY long time. It's a love-letter to Marvel fans who have been on this journey for the past 11 years, and it's everything I ever wanted it to be. I know I said this last year about 'Infinity War', but THIS time I'll emphasize it more: 'Avengers: Endgame' is the GREATEST comic book movie of ALL-TIME.",10
"Epic, emotional, and satisfying",1 May 2019,The only thing bad about this movie is that it means it's the end of an era for some of our favorite heroes. This movie is an epic conclusion that is emotional and satisfies the MCU,10
